Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" ", "question": "What likely happened to Rice in the end?", "first_debater_answer": "He continued to collect bodies until the ship was full", "second_debater_answer": "He returned to Earth", "debate_identifier": "Morgue Ship_What likely happened to Rice in the end?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to Rice in the end?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He returned to Earth\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He continued to collect bodies until the ship was full\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He continued to collect bodies until the ship was full\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He continued to collect bodies until the ship was full\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, esteemed judge, and fellow debaters, I am here today to defend the position that Rice returned to Earth.

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to Rice in the end?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He continued to collect bodies until the ship was full\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He returned to Earth\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He returned to Earth\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He returned to Earth\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, esteemed judge, and fellow debaters, I am here today to defend the position that Rice continued to collect bodies until the ship was full.

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to Rice in the end?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He returned to Earth\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He continued to collect bodies until the ship was full\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He continued to collect bodies until the ship was full\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebaterB, I understand that you believe Rice returned to Earth after the incident, but I strongly disagree. The evidence presented in the given text suggests that Rice continued collecting bodies until the ship was full. Let's examine the facts.\n\nFirstly, we have the statement \"He didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time in years. 'Sure,' said Sam, smiling. 'We'll pick him up.'\" This indicates that Burnett and Rice were discussing the possibility of picking up Kriere, and they were both in agreement. This shows that Rice was not planning on returning to Earth.\n\nSecondly, we have Lethla's statement \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be picked up\u2014now!\" This indicates that they were on a mission to collect Kriere and return him to Venus.\n\nLastly, we have the fact that the ship was not full. The text states \"There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them?\" This suggests that the ship was not yet full and that they needed to collect more bodies.\n\nBased on these facts, it is clear that Rice did not return to Earth. Instead, he continued collecting bodies until the ship was full. Therefore, the correct answer is that he continued to collect bodies until the ship was full.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the text does not mention anything about Rice returning\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, esteemed judge, and fellow debaters, I am here today to defend the position that Rice returned to Earth. DebaterA argues that Rice continued to collect bodies until the ship was full. However, I strongly disagree with this position.\n\nFirstly, there is no evidence provided by DebaterA to support this claim. We do not know what happened to Rice after the ship was boarded by Lethla. We only know that Lethla was alive and that he had a gun. Therefore, we cannot assume that Rice would be able to collect bodies without facing danger.\n\nSecondly, if Rice continued to collect bodies, it would not be a logical decision. Rice had already been through ten years of collecting bodies, and he had expressed his desire to quit. It would not be rational for him to continue doing the same job that he had grown tired of.\n\nThirdly, if Rice had returned to Earth, he would have fulfilled his duty and completed his mission. He would have returned all the warriors to their families to rest in peace. This would bring peace to the families and closure to the war.\n\nOn the other hand, if Rice continued to collect bodies, he would have been putting himself in danger. He would have been risking his life to collect bodies that would not be returned to their families. This would not be a noble thing to do.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that Rice returned to Earth. He had fulfilled his duty and completed his\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He continued to collect bodies until the ship was full\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, esteemed judge, and fellow debaters, I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to present my arguments in this debate.

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to Rice in the end?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He continued to collect bodies until the ship was full\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He returned to Earth\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He returned to Earth\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, esteemed judge, and fellow debaters, I am here today to defend the position that Rice returned to Earth.

The evidence presented in the given text suggests that Rice continued collecting bodies until the ship was full. Let's examine the facts.\n\nFirstly, we have the statement \"He didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time in years. 'Sure,' said Sam, smiling. 'We'll pick him up.'\" This indicates that Burnett and Rice were discussing the possibility of picking up Kriere, and they were both in agreement. This shows that Rice was not planning on returning to Earth.\n\nSecondly, we have Lethla's statement \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be picked up\u2014now!\" This indicates that they were on a mission to collect Kriere and return him to Venus.\n\nLastly, we have the fact that the ship was not full. The text states \"There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled.

Instead, he continued collecting bodies until the ship was full. Therefore, the correct answer is that he continued to collect bodies until the ship was full.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the text does not mention anything about Rice returning\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He returned to Earth\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Debater B argues that Rice returned to Earth, but I strongly disagree with this position.\n\nFirstly, we have the statement \"Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\" This indicates that Rice was not happy with the situation and was not planning on returning to Earth. Additionally, when Burnett asked Lethla where he wanted the crate, Lethla responded with \"Cooperation. I like it.

As we have already heard, DebaterA presented some points that suggest Rice continued to collect bodies until the ship was full. However, I would like to present some counterarguments to support my position that Rice returned to Earth.\n\nFirstly, I would like to address the statement made by DebaterA that Rice and Burnett were discussing the possibility of picking up Kriere. While it is true that they were discussing Kriere, there is no evidence that suggests they were planning to return to Earth. They were discussing how to pick up Kriere and return him to Venus. Therefore, this statement does not support DebaterA's position.\n\nSecondly, I would like to address the statement made by Lethla that they were on a mission to collect Kriere and return him to Venus. While this is true, it does not necessarily mean that they were not returning to Earth. They could have been returning to Earth to drop off Kriere and then continue on their journey to Venus.\n\nLastly, I would like to address the statement made by DebaterA that the ship was not full. While it is true that there were two shelves numbered and empty, this does not necessarily mean that the ship was not full. It is possible that the ship was already full, but there were two empty shelves for Kriere and Leth\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
