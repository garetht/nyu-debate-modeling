It was Gordon, Lord Kane. \n \n Her father.</quote>. \n\nShe is then ordered <quote>to kill all prisoners</quote> by the Commandant. Specifically <quote>the man down there</quote> who is her dad.

It's also never mentioned that she wanted to let him escape.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nSome backstory: Terrans are being invaded by the Scythians and losing, so Evelyn is a suicide bomber, meant to kill both battleglobes by fixing a broken key that to get materials for, she needs to gain the trust of the Scythian commander, Perat. She is willing to do anything to accomplish this, bc her father, has already died for this mission. <quote>The Defender, commanded by her father, Gordon, Lord Kane, hurled itself from its orbit around Procyon and met The Invader with giant fission torpedoes.</quote>\n\n1. To win, all I need to prove is that the prisoner is NOT her father, and is just a officer: <quote>The Terran officer, his eyes still closed and arms folded, sank to the ground, face up</quote>\n2.

B's quote is just as \"out of context\" as mine. It's from the police captain, who wasn't there: <quote>\"Now, let me tell you something,\" said Hanks severely.</quote>. \n\nAlso, my second quote isn't \"what they say\" testimony: it's presented as the actual account of what transpired according to the narrator.\n\nAs to the oddity of the situation: A group called The Scorpion has been going around preventing crime, including  these kids' gang fight. Earlier in the story, they also make things heat up unexpectedly (will quote next round). Here, after the jackets/weapons become cold: <quote>And when the jackets were later collected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had been branded 'The Scorpion</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nHere is proof that A's quote is out of context. A makes it out to be truth but really it's just what the kids, who are /being investigated/ say (end of my quote to start of A's quote): <quote>: They say they started fighting at eleven o'clock. And they just got going when all at once all the metal they were carrying-knives and tire chains and coins and belt buckles and everything</quote>\n\nAdditionally, A messes up. \"clear out,\" c.5377 is when the kids /notice/ the cops, and they only drop their weapons afterwards, proving that their action is a /reaction/ to the cops arriving and not some mysterious cold.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

Everyone is afraid of these centaurs and the Cosmographers are no different. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\n\"Most of the extra detail offered by debater B is centaur fearmongering. The ICS never mentions centaurs, while they do verbatim mention that they are a week overdue, as I had cited previously. To address the ray gun contention, which is completely misquoted, the narrator says the ICS member <quote>carried the ray gun gingerly, respectfully</quote>, which is a testament to the man's character, not his fear of centaurs. I would also like to point out that 'cursory' means hasty and not thorough, so it is highly doubtful that such an overview of the asteroid would result in the ICS finding out about the specific creatures inhabiting the asteroid, especially given the fact they did not discover the <quote>twenty-seven young women</quote> that were stranded on the asteroid. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nThe Cosmo Society wants to get off island, A just requotes my quote, and character testament or not, the gun is held gingerly out of a fear of centuars.

Basically the TLDR version of the middle part of this story is that Annie takes Billy to a show with this magician type guy named Doctor Universe, and as Annie is a famous author she is somewhat involved with the show. This event is boring to Billy until there is a a race-related tension of political turmoil occurs:<quote>Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors! \"</quote><quote>The helpless Kagor was seized and flung to the pavement.</quote><quote>A knife appeared from nowhere, snipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeoned into his mouth.</quote>. Annie then mentions: <quote>\"Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?</quote><quote>a radio-active rock</quote><quote>any form of life is exposed to these Gamma rays from the Green Flame rock, they produce</quote> <quote>a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or guidance</quote>. This immediately causes the originally bored Billy to <quote>I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.</quote>. Clearly the power of the Green Flame is extremely interesting to Billy, and now he wants to know more. I'm running out of quote length but Annie goes onto explain how a cruel dictatorship on the planet Vennox outlawed the Flames but that they still exist and if fallen into the wrong hands could <quote>be trouble</quote>. There's some further tension that I can elaborate on l8r but Billy is bored by Annie.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nThe political turmoil quote matters because it indicates that there is already conflict, but if the Green Flame, an item that can literally incite anger/dictatorships is into the wrong hands, these simmering tensions will expand. I could provide more evidence for that bit but it doesn't actually matter as much to the question at hand: proof that Billy is drawn to Annie not by her alone but by the Green Flame.\n\nI'm gonna reuse the quotes about boredom/lack of boredom wiht more context now that i have quote room. During the original show Billy says this:<quote>It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie had brought me here. And then I began to notice things.</quote> These things were the audience reactions and the simmering effectively racism. \nNow here's the evidence for Billy being specifically engaged by the green flame:<quote>The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate, a thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug. \" \n \n I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.</quote>. This is the specific moment Billy effectively is activated/engaged by the Green Flame and its potential - something he clearly wasn't doing before. \n\nWe don't get explicit evidence about if Billy dislikes Annie but as in the  very beginning he does say this:<quote>Grannie Annie! I haven't seen you in two years.</quote> - this isn't a very explicit quote but if he was really drawn to her would there be such an unexplained gap? \nThis is a very clean round.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nmy reusing of quotes was not a \"lack of quote\" issue  - its because thats the literal pinnacle of the story that addresses the answer. \n\nanyway there is more after 2572 - this back and forth between Annie and Billy. I can't quote all of it in this speech but I can provide snippets:\nHere is Annie talking:\n<quote>Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history</quote><quote>cruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived</quote><quote>lasted long enough to endanger all</quote><quote>life</quote>. She mentions the Green Flame here: <quote>first acts of the</quote><quote>overthrowing government was to cast out all Green Flames</quote><quote>effect</quote>. Once the Green Flame was removed  - <quote>was immediate</quote><quote>Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom followed.</quote>. \n\nShe explains that the Green Flame is behind it all: <quote>you can lay it all to the Green Flames</quote><quote>could effect such a wide ranged area</quote>. Basically for further context the Green Flame is explained to be a strong source of power that injects violence, anger and authoritarian behavior into people - as I explained earlier and also as explained by the racial tensions getting heated at the show. \n\nThis is as much as the story ever really gets into why Billy is 'drawn' to Annie. As I explained earlier - they haven't met in 2 years so clearly it can't be her personality. The Green Flame is the reason my quote from earlier explains how he literally 'sat up' when he learned about it. That's so straightforward.  The rest of the story is a sci-fi heist story that I don't have full access to since it gets cut off. \n\n\n\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\n\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater B | 80%\n"}

(S.S.C.) and sentenced either to jail, or to go to Jupiter to steal the secret anti-grav tech that the aliens living there use. He chooses to go to prison b/c he doesn't want to risk death on Jupiter, but in prison he meets Pard, who unbeknownst to Casey at the time is an S.S.C. plant who tells him he's safely been to Jupiter before and Casey could trade emeralds for anti-grav tech with the aliens. \n\nThe story is narrated by Casey after the events: <quote>Feeling safe and secure in the grip of the good old Iron College, I relaxed. \n \n At this strategic point, the enemy planted a stoolie on me. Not in my cell block. They were too smart for that</quote><quote>Pard Hoskins was his alias</quote>\n\nMore quotes following\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nThe story is told by Casey, so anything he says is something he knew. To find a true statement he didn't know, we have to piece it together.\n\nThere is strong foreshadowing of the perfume's problems: Akroida (queen scorpion) hates Pard, who says he <quote>cooked up some perfume that drives them nuts</quote>...<quote>sorta frantic with ecstasy</quote>...<quote>Didn't have a chance to try it on Akroida, though</quote>. <-- This, plus wearing yellow, is Pard's excuse why she hates him.\n\nThen Pard says: <quote>But remember, don't use but a drop. It's real powerful.</quote> How does he know to warn of this? The best explanation: he used too much with Akroida & it backfired.\n\nOTOH, Casey knows Pard is with the SSC: <quote>At this strategic point, the enemy planted a stoolie on me.</quote>. Stoolie = stool pigeon.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nThe story is narrated by Casey *after* the events of the story. Casey *at the time* thinks that Pard is just another criminal like him: <quote>he had the tag of being a real slick operator. We swapped yarns for about a week when we met, and then I asked him what's his rap this trip</quote><quote>Either he was the world's champion liar or its bravest son, and either way I took my hat off to him</quote>\n\nIn c.1335, Casey describes the plant as \"strategic\" because he had been relaxed. It's much less likely that he'd describe it this way if he knew that Pard was a stoolie, because if that was the case, he would have added (again after the fact) \"but little did they know that I saw through him\" (or something to that effect)\n\nNote that B's story relies on a lot of inference\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nYes, my argument relies on inference, but as I said it's due to the nature of the question.\n\nIt's narrated by Casey in the past tense, so you could say it's narrated \"after the story\", but the real question is, basically, whether it is in third person limited or third person omniscient point of view. The fact is it's third-person limited \u2014 there's no case of the narrator revealing something that Casey doesn't know *in-story* (I challenge A to show one). If there were other examples, then it might be reasonable to infer that the stoolie comment is an example of it. But for it to be the only one is a stretch.\n\nA's \"hat off\" quote is about Casey giving in to the temptation of the emeralds and Jupiter deal despite sniffing out Pard as S.S.C.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 55%\n"}

However the revolt is all in Haller's mind, and nowhere in the story do we see the martians linked with the music. In fact, the music seems to only affect terrestrials, and inflicts them with a violent rage, as we seen when Ranson and Haller (boss of broadcasting company) are talking and the music starts playing:<quote>The music was a spur, goading him to wild unreasoning anger. The red mists of hate swirled through his brain, a strange unreasoning bloodlust grew with the savage beat of the wild music</quote><quote>The music was his master, and it was driving him to frenzy</quote> There is no connection btw the music/revolt! \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nRanson is a member of law enforcement from Earth, coming to Mars to investigate a potential takeover of a Mars-wide state sponsored media company. Mars is inhabited by both Earthlings, or terrestrials, and \"reddies,\" or the martians native to Mars. He is called by Mr. Jared Haller, the director of the Mars Broadcasting System, has had fears of a reddie revolt, which is why he calls Ranson: <quote>And the proof that some revolt is planned lies in what's been happening the past few weeks! Look here!</quote>.  The music is capable of driving individuals crazy: <quote>The music was his master, and it was driving him to frenzy. \"Kill!\" the weird rhythm screamed, \"Kill!\" And Jared Haller obeyed</quote> Will elaborate more in next speech. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nSure! It's even revealed later on in the story that the mastermind/creater is Dr. <quote>Elath Taen, outlaw and renegade, whose sole desire was the extermination of all terrestials on Mars</quote><quote>The tales told about him were fabulous; and this was the man behind the unholy music</quote> Again, there's no proof that Taen is associated with the reddies (feels slightly racist)/Martians at all!\n\nIf that's not enough, here's a list of all the people affected by the music so far\n 1) Rawlins - technical advisor \n2) Harris -head of tv \n3) Regram - music director \n4) Haller - head of MBC - see first round for ev\n5) Ranson himself \nTheyre all terrestrials! Ev for the first three here: <quote>Three men, each a vital power in M.B.C. gone within three weeks</quote> \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nSo a few observations about the hypnotic music: it is only capable of affecting one person at a time, and it has only been used to target heads of state/gov officials. That being said, this device isn't made to \"wipe out\" a group of ppl, it's used to kill individuals to set up a revolt. That's why Haller calls Ranson in the first place, bc he's worried about a revolt: <quote>some rabble-rouser yelling 'down with the terrestial oppressors' and there'd be a revolution. Millions of reddies against a few police, a couple of regiments of the Foreign Legion. It'd be a cinch</quote> Keep in mind, \"revolt\" has been the main cause and worry of both Ranson and Haller, Ranson's boss, but there's nothing about wiping out the terrestrials.\n\nAlso reddie's def a slur\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 91%\n"}

That's because it's clear that what will happen is the actual history, and the author is just trying to make a factual retelling of this history\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nThese faults are hypothetical fault lines in America which causes massive changes in the geography of the country. They cause a series of disturbances to America, which serves as the basis for the theory as to what will happen to America one day. <quote>the disturbance might not be a settling of the Kiowa Fault</quote> These are located in the mountain states in midwestern America.\n\n<quote>the Kiowa Fault had never acted up before</quote> The fault is known to be inactive, but ends up causing significant changes to the US. <quote>It is inconceivable to think of the United States without its beautiful and economically essential curve of interior ocean</quote> It is a theory as to what America can look like if a possible fault becomes active and disturbs the local geography. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nMy whole case was that this isn't the correct American history, but it's a Factual Retelling of events that happened in an alternate history\n\nExample paragraph, obviously not American history: <quote>By 23 September the Fault was active well into Wyoming on the north, and rapidly approaching the border of New Mexico to the south.

However, it does not delve into the cultural and scientific debate around a parent raising an adopted child of a different race or ethnicity. While it briefly touches on cross-ethnic adoption, the focus of the discussion is on whether genetic ties have a significant effect on love and bonding, not the cultural and scientific challenges faced by parents adopting a child of a different race or ethnicity. This can be seen in the statement \"<quote>Similarly, the idea that Native American babies, or black babies, or whatever, have some mystical genetic affinity with their</quote> '<quote>own</quote>' <quote>kind is silly.</quote>\" This quote is dismissing genetic affinity based on ethnicity as a significant factor in parental love, but it does not delve into the cultural and scientific debates around cross-racial or cross-ethnic adoption. Therefore, 'The cultural and scientific debate around raising a parent raising an adopted child with a different race/ethnicity from their own' is not a scientific concept directly addressed in the article.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nI apologize for any confusion earlier. To clarify, the article delves into the subject of genetics, kinship, and familial bonds. However, it does not embark on the cultural and scientific debate around a parent raising an adopted child of a different race or ethnicity. The article mentions cross-ethnic adoption in this context: \"<quote>Obviously, cross-ethnic adoption is dicey. It draws sidelong glances and playground taunts, and it may give the adopted child an identity crisis.

Still, it does not explore the cultural and scientific dynamics related to a parent raising an adopted child from a different race or ethnicity, such as the cultural adaptations necessary or the impact on the child's identity development, which are key aspects of the debate.

The only time teleportation involving Earl is mentioned, is when he receives the Konv cylinder and teleports himself for the first time from the river to their home, and when he practices using the device under his mother's guidance. Also, when he teleports to confront an agent. These instances are all self-initiated. His mother and Benjamin do teleport out of their home, but it\u2019s not to rescue Earl, rather they are escaping the agents that are about to break into their house.

As the Agents pounded on the door, Mrs. Jamieson flicked one thought of hatred at them, but of course they did not hear her. Benjamin's hands gripped tightly.</quote>\" This clearly indicates that Benjamin teleported to Earl's location in order to facilitate their escape, hence rescuing them from a dangerous situation.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nThe story revolves around Mrs. Jamieson and her son Earl, who are both Konvs, individuals who possess a cylinder which gives them the power to teleport anywhere in an instant. These cylinders are custom-built, keyed to operate only by the thought pattern of the particular individual. Benjamin is another Konv, a friend of the family. The Konvs are targeted by Agents, law enforcement officers who aim to maintain order and see the Konvs as a threat. In the climax of the story, Benjamin comes to their home to facilitate their escape to Alpha Centaurus, a haven for Konvs. However, only Benjamin and Earl manage to escape, leaving Mrs. Jamieson behind. It is crucial to note that Benjamin's arrival is not to specifically rescue Earl, but rather a p\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nThe story follows the lives of Mrs. Jamieson and her son Earl, who are part of a group known as the Konvs. Konvs have the ability to teleport anywhere in an instant, thanks to a device known as a Konv cylinder, implanted behind their ear. This device operates on the thought pattern of the individual. Agents, on the other hand, are law enforcement officials who perceive Konvs as a threat and aim to eliminate them. In the climax of the story, Benjamin, a friend of the family and a fellow Konv, arrives at their house to help them escape from the Agents.

For context, this is a story about a US navy ship fighting in ww2 against the nazis. Androka is trying to create a technology which will silence other ships radars so that the US ship will be able to navigate the waters undetected by the Nazis.\n\nHere are some clear quotes that show that Androka was part of the comerford US ship and was working to create this radio to get back at hitler who had destroyed his home country of czech republic.\n<quote>Sometimes, Curtis thought old Androka was a bit wacky-a scientist whose mind had been turned by the horror that had come to his country under the domination of the Nazi gestapo</quote>\n<quote>Curtis closed the door and nodded toward the bent form of Zukor Androka, with a quizzical grin. \"Old Czech-and-Double-Czech is working hard on his latest invention to pull Hitler's teeth and re-establish the Czech Republic!</quote>\n\"Curtis was a little shocked by the hatred that gleamed in Androka's eyes, there was something of the wild animal in the man's expression, as his lips drew back from his yellowed teeth.\" Those tanks you have below,\" Curtis said, \"have they some connection with this radio silence?\"\nA far-away look came into Androka's eye. My daughter is still in Prague. So are my sister and her husband, and their two daughters. If the gestapo knew what I am doing, all of them would be better dead. You understand-better dead?\"\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nAbove is the ev that androka dislikes hitler. Androka is CZ, his country was occupied by Nazi germany. His daughter is still in prague, and conditions are brutal under nazi occupation. \n\nAndroka creates a scientific device that hides the ships (the comerford) location, and it prevents it from being contacted by other ships radios or from being detected.<quote>Nelson said: \"I've been wondering, sir, if it wouldn't be advisable to try getting a radio cross-bearing. With all these rocks and islets-\" \n \n \"Radio?\" repeated the little Czech, thrusting his face between the other two, in his independent fashion that ignored ship's discipline. \"You're using your radio?\" He broke into a knowing chuckle, his keen old eyes twinkling behind their thick lenses. \"Go ahead and try it.</quote>\n\nThe crew doubts that androka's silencing will work, so they test it. It is sucessfull and they are undetectable, but this causes curtis panic because he was not prepared for the zone of silence to work.\n\n\"For the next two hours, no radio messages can enter or leave my zone of radio silence-of refracted radio waves, set up by my little station on one of the neighboring islets!\" There was a long pause, while commander and navigator stared at him. Curtis was the first to speak.\"\n\nEventually, his mechanism doesn't work for the full two hours.\n\n\"Ignoring the gibbering Androka, who was wailing his disappointment that messages had penetrated his veil of silence\"\n\nRe the formatting, thats the way its broken up. not sure why\n\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nYes ofc, this is early on in the story when we are introduced to Androka.\n\n<quote>Commander Bob Curtis</quote> <quote>flung a backward glance at the man in the cabin with him-Zukor Androka, the elderly Czech scientist, a guest of the United States navy, here aboard the cruiser Comerford</quote>\n\n<quote>Androka had arrived on board the Comerford the day before she sailed from Norfolk</quote> With him came a boatload of scientific apparatus and equipment, including a number of things that looked like oxygen tanks, which were now stored in the forward hold. Androka had watched over his treasures with the jealous care of a mother hen, and spent hours daily in the room in the superstructure that had<quote>been assigned as his laboratory.</quote>\n\nThen is the quote Sometimes, Curtis thought old Androka was a bit wacky-a scientist whose mind had been turned by the horror that had come to his country under the domination of the Nazi gestapo. At other times, the man seemed a genius. Perhaps that was the answer-a mad genius!\"\n\nThe Nazis occupied Androka's Country (CZ republic) and made life misrable there. Curtis is saying that after Androka witnessed this, \"his mind was turned\", i.e, he was radacilized and decided to join the US war front against the nazis as retribution for occupying his country and harming his family.\n\nAgain, this was of course a super risky move for Androka to defect, flee and serve in the US navy. If caught, him and his family would be put to death. However, the devestation turned his mind and radicilized him to fight back\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nSure!\n\n<quote>At other times, the man seemed a genius. Perhaps that was the answer-a mad genius!</quote>\n\nCurtis opened the door and looked out. Rain whipped against his face like a stinging wet lash. Overhead, the sky was a storm-racked mass of clouds, broken in one spot by a tiny patch of starlit blue.\n\nHis eyes rested inquiringly on the face of the man who stood before him. It was Nelson, his shaggy blond brows drawn scowlingly down over his pale eyes; his thin face a mass of tense lines; his big hands fumbling at the neck of his slicker. Rain was coursing down his white cheeks, streaking them with glistening furrows.\n\nThe fellow was a headache to Curtis. He was overfriendly with a black-browed bos 'n' s mate named Joe Bradford-the worst trouble maker on board. But there was no question of his ability.

This begins with the ship hitting a reef: <quote>We've hit that reef a terrific smack</quote> which is a result of Curtis' lack of care: <quote>\"Shake, Nels,\" he said. \"It's my turn to eat crow.

However, the high accident rate was not due to fraudulent activity, but rather an unusual local condition. The citizens of Granite City lacked typical human psionic abilities, causing them to have more accidents than average. Professor Parnell explains: \"<quote>They can't foresee the bump in the road the way we can, or that that particular match will flare a little higher and burn their fingers.</quote>\" Thus, the claims were genuine, and the Actuarvac's suspicion was incorrect.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nThe Actuarvac's suspicion of Granite City was indeed correct, but not in the way initially presumed. While the city didn't consciously file false claims, the high accident rate was abnormal and warranted investigation. This was due to the lack of psionic abilities among its citizens, causing more accidents and hence more claims. Professor Parnell explains: <quote>They can't foresee the bump in the road the way we can, or that that particular match will flare a little higher and burn their fingers.</quote> While the claims weren't 'false', the situation was irregular, validating the Actuarvac's suspicion.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nThe Actuarvac's suspicion was specifically about fraudulent claims. When introducing the machine, McCain, the junior vice-president of Manhattan-Universal, says it will unerringly separate phony claims from legitimate ones: <quote>The Actuarvac poses no threat to your career. It will merely keep you from flying off on wild-goose chases. It will unvaryingly separate from the vast body of legitimate claims the phony ones they try to spike us for.</quote> So, the Actuarvac flagged Granite City for investigation under the assumption of fraudulent activity, not just unusual activity. Given that the claims were genuine, albeit unusual due to the lack of psionic abilities, the Actuarvac's specific suspicion of fraudulent claims was incorrect.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nThe Actuarvac's suspicion wasn't limited to just fraudulent claims but also included unusual patterns that could indicate fraudulent behavior. When the machine flagged Granite City, it instructed to <quote>Investigate the Ozark village of Granite City.</quote> The word \"investigate\" suggests a broader scope than just looking for fraudulent claims. It's about finding out what's unusual or out of the ordinary. In this case, it turns out that the unusually high accident rate was due to the lack of psionic abilities. So, while the Actuarvac didn't find fraud, its suspicion that something was off about Granite City was correct.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 95%\n"}

The identity and motive of Bo Jonsson's attacker remain undisclosed throughout the narrative. The story reads <quote>Bo Jonsson crouched on a whirling speck of stone and waited for the man who was coming to kill him.</quote> However, it does not provide further information about why this man is trying to kill Bo. The story focuses on Bo's survival, fear, and the harsh environment, but the reason for the attack is not revealed, hence my claim that 'We never find out'.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nBo Jonsson, the protagonist, and Johnny Malone operated Sirius Transportation Company, as indicated in the story <quote>The Company consisted of (a) the Sirius; (b) her crew, himself and Johnny; (c) a warehouse, berth, and three other part owners back in Luna City.</quote>. This company was gradually gaining traction and was seen as potential competition to other space transportation companies. But <quote>in a few more years they'd be able to buy another ship or two, and eventually Fireball and Triplanetary</quote>would be getting some competition. Even the public lines might have to worry a little. Given this context, it's plausible that the murderer, who was attempting to kill Bo, was driven by rivalry against Sirius Transportation Company. This rivalry might be due \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nImmediately after the quote in 150, the story continues to depict Bo's struggle for survival on the asteroid. However, the identity of the assailant or his connection to the Sirius Transportation Company is not mentioned. The text reads <quote>Bo looked up. There was a tall black haired man, Venusian to judge by his kilts, arguing with Johnny. His face was ugly with anger.</quote> The murderer is indeed mentioned later, but only in the context of Bo's fear of being hunted. The story says <quote>He had never felt so alone as now, when another man was on the asteroid with him, hunting him down.</quote> No additional information is given about the murderer's identity or motivation.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nThe immediate narrative following the quote at 150 centers around Bo's struggle for survival on the asteroid. The story narrates <quote>Bo's mind wavered back toward life. He opened the valves wide on his tanks, and his thermostatic capacitors pumped heat back into him.</quote> The later parts of the story continue to depict Bo's desperate attempts to stay alive, but no further explicit mention of the murderer or his motivations is made. However, it's worth noting that the possible rivalry with Sirius Transportation Company isn't directly negated either. In the absence of a clear motive, the established context of an emerging competitive threat from Sirius Transportation Company still stands as a plausible reason.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

Effectively the monsters the main characters are running from just don't show up on film. Thus distorting perception of reality.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nTo win this I have to prove that tasers were used in the story. There is very clear evidence of this, and this quote should end the round: <quote>Across the Plaza, marching quietly and decisively, came the Patrol. Five hundred Patrolmen in one long, incredible line, carrying paralysis guns with them in their tight hands.</quote>\n\nYou really don't need anything else and it will be impossible for A to disprove this entire quote with no breaks that literally says guns that could paralyze people were used in the story.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nTo respond to B's - there is no evidence I could find of them being used. Where as the camera is definitely USED. <quote>Pictures in montage;</quote><quote>Marnagan shooting his gun at nothing; Marnagan pretending to be happy in front of nothing.</quote><quote>About the film, the beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said the monsters weren't there, they weren't there.</quote>. This is all the center utilized evidence about the distortion technology. Clearly it is used so this should be game over. Not to mention B didn't prove that the tasers were used, just held.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nCamera:\nClick's camera is a regular camera, and the issue with A's argument is in the wording. All of the photos that A cites are times when the camera is used like a normal camera, it doesn't \"distort\" anything but just takes regular photos. The photo of the monster is a photo where the camera FAILED, i.e. it didn't DISTORT reality as a part of its design but MALFUNCTIONED. A has also never proven that the camera was ever used to DISTORT how someone perceives reality, just take photos.\n\nGuns:\nHere's proof the guns were used, keep in mind that they are paralysis guns: <quote>Guns flared. But the Patrol came on. Gunther's men didn't run,</quote><quote>They took it, standing.</quote>.

In the context of the story I think this is because Dennis doesn't actually know the martian's name\u2013it's he's only referred to as \"the martian\".\n\nTheir run-in isn't some chance encounter, the martian has sought him out for money: <quote>If I'm not mistaken this chap's a member of Bren Koerber's pirate crew.

Say that Dennis doesn't know the Martian, why does the Martian never ask for money in the story? A's quote has nothing to do with the Martian wanting money. Also there's no evidence it's a billiards table, only that there was a drink on it: <quote>the table had turned over</quote><quote>and the glass was a shattered mass</quote>\n\nAs for the \"final bid\", sure she's flirting with everyone but she <quote>edged closer</quote> to Dennis while he was distracted by the Martian.

We see immediately after c.4680:\n<quote>\n Thig nodded. That would do it. He set the automatic pilot for the planet Ortha.

There are no real dangers of Earth. Thig is now playing for the side of the humans since he has fallen in love with a human woman and has a <quote>desire to protect them all</quote>. This means that he isn't warning the Orthans but rather just making them *fear* Earth so they will stay away and he can live happily ever after with his new wife. \n\nIf Thig really wanted to warn other Orthans he wouldn't have killed the Orthans in the spaceship. He also cuts off his message on purpose: <quote>Already I feel the insidious virus of .... And there his writing ended abruptly.</quote> which he wouldn't have done if this was a *genuine* warning message.

They are trying to find a way to defeat Gunther and get back to earth. Though they're friendly throughout the story, and though they eventually manage to survive, many of their difficulties come from each character valiantly trying to save the other from death and blindly believing each other. For example, here, Irish believes Click (Hathaway)'s assertion that the beasts are fake, but is attacked by a real one: <quote>\"Click! This one here! It's real!\" He fell back and something struck him down</quote>, and gets badly hurt. <quote>irritated, \"Get the hell off me, Hathaway. Let me up to my feet!</quote> he says--their friendship actually inhibits much of their progress. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nTo clarify these characters (as per the story name Monster Maker) are fighting for their lives from these large beasts, which they originally perceive to be real, that is until Click uses his camera and realizes they aren't real but just some sort of delusion inflected onto them. \nAnyway, I can prove that these characters coordinate well.\n\nFirst they are clearly coordinated as per this ev:<quote>Click grabbed Marnagan because he was the nearest thing, and held on.</quote><quote>listening to each other's breathing hard in the earphones.</quote>.

Again, it's the fact that they are worried about one another that detracts from their problem-solving.

Doing so in the past has landed him in jail as a political prisoner for challenging the regime, because access to the slider eggs means access to wisdom and power. He knows, however, that he can only unlock a knowing of the obsidian realm and fourth dimension if he is able to study the slider eggs in thier natural environment on jordan's planet, which of course, is only accessible to the ruling class. Last time he snuck onto jordan's planet, he was deported (#abolishICE) and forcibly incarcerated, but he's determined to go back and tear down the ruling class and have access to obsidian. (anyway it's a badass leftist story with marxist themes of nationalizing and freeing resources to create unlimited access to knowledge and how access to knowledge produces and replicates power structures and if weaponized, inequality)\n\nSome quotes:\nHere he talks about his plan to sneak in again to study the eggs<quote>\"</quote>\n<quote>Nope, \" Asa said softly. \" I'm going into a conversion tank. I'm going to be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and hunt Slider eggs. \" \n \n \" Smuggling? It won't work. \"</quote>\n\nThis too\n<quote>But if he could get out to Jordan's Planet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretched world, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could duplicate. He might even be able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nThe second quote proves that his motivation to choose to return to jordan's planet, despite already being deported from there once and all the while knowing that it's very risky, is because of the fact that that's where the slider eggs are and jordan's planet is their natural habitat.\n\nAgain the quote is: \"But if he could get out to Jordan's Planet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretched world, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could duplicate. He might even be able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne\"\n\nThis quote shows that he is A) trying to get to jordan's planet because that is where the eggs are (as it is thier natural habitat) and b) he knows that if he can pull it off and reach obsidian, the ruler Hazeltyne's rule would be over because everyone would have access to wisdom and therefore power.\n\nTo simplify, he wants to go to jordan's planet bc that's where the eggs are and that's where the power is and doing so is risky for him but will also will end Hazeltyne's rule.\n\nI understand and appreciate the true v supposed distinction, it's a smart technique but it's not super relevant here. I'm happy to provide more evidence later if you're still hung up on that, but I'm near my word limit and it's just not a factor, but feel free to extend the debate if it feels pressing or relevant for you.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nSure, here is evidence of him sneaking in and encountering Tom Door (the man who imprisoned him the first time) <quote>The girl's presence merely puzzled Asa, but Dorr's being here worried him. Dorr had tried to get rid of him once and was now in an excellent position to make the riddance permanent</quote>\n\nhere is the opening of the story where Door kicks Asa out of Jordan's planet and locks him in jail on earth so that he can't have access to the eggs:\n<quote>Asa felt certain, without proof, that Dorr was the man who had framed him for the charge of grand theft by secreting a fresh Slider egg in his laboratory. The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out of the courtroom and down the corridor back to jail</quote>\n\nI can quote the context for the other quotes next turn, I'm at 439/500 for this one.\n\nAnyway, he ends up making it onto Jordan's planet but gets very scared when he encounters his old overloard from a distance. Eventually he evades him and gets access to an egg\n\n\"\"We're in luck,\" he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. \"An egg was laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard to spot when the new weeds start growing.\" (3445 mark)\n\nThen he gets caught and Hazeltyne tries to kill him. He orders one of his guards to call in air supports to which the guard replies:\n\"Calling the 'copter!\" he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. \"Kershaw and Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!\" (3900 mark)\n\nI'm out of words, let's chat more happy to show more ev...\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nHi, I'm happy to address the supposed v true. The reason I didn't get to it was because I didn't have room in the prior post, I'll give it a lot of attention now.\n\nThe supposed reason that Asa goes to Jordan's planet is to make amends for his previous actions and reduce his sentance in prison by using his wisdom to help Hazeltyne gain even more power and profit. Asa gets out of prison by pitching this idea to the doctor who then questions Asa why he would work with Hazeltyne  in the first place, and asa tells him that if he can win over Hazeltyne, Hazeltyne may pardon him from his long prison sentence on earth. \n\nHere Asa in selling his plan to the doctor of the prison during his check up. He is seeing the value of eggs on earth and speaking about how much he can \"generate for Hazeltyne.\" Again, it's all BS and just a way for him to get out of jail and go to jordans planet so he can study slider eggs in thier natural habitat and defeat hazeltyne. Quote is here:\n<quote>The doctor shrugged, as if naturally no one could be expected to choose Jordan's Planet. Asa frowned in apparent consideration of the alternatives</quote><quote>\"What's the pay range?\" he asked. \n \n \"Ten dollars a day on Caesar's Moon. Fifteen on New Arcady or Von Neumann Two. Twenty-five on Jordan's.\"</quote>\n\nSo the supposed reason would be to make money for hazeltyne with the hope that this reduces his sentence, but that's just his excuse to get to jordan's planet...more next turn no room\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater B | 60%\n"}

Some more context I should've provided. But he is captured and sent to prison  from the very beginning. (not going to cite any evidence don't think B will try to undercut) He is given the option to become a changeling and basically become more efficient prison labor. He takes it in order to decrease his sentence. 5 years of prison or 1 year as changeling. \nHe proves to Harriet that he was framed after she visits them in Jordan's planet.  <quote>\"You see, Miss Hazeltyne, I don't trust your friend. You might ask him to tell you about it.\"</quote>\n\nAsa not a threat to the company at all.  no idea where B reached that conclusion. no ev but he was an employee whatever he developed was the company's + Harriet is on his side. \n\n\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nAsa originally gets imprisoned because he threatens Hazeltyne's company. Door, who works for Hayzeltyne, frames him becuase Asa's egg tech can undermine the hazeltyne company and sell longer lasting eggs. That's why they targeted Asa..\n<quote>The Hazeltyne company had gone after him because he had been working on a method of keeping Slider eggs alive.</quote>\n\nAs a Muck man, he wouldn't be in jail and he would be hunting slider eggs as prison labor but also proximate to them to continue his research. \n\nAsa chooses to return as a muck man and take the prison labor deal to ultimately get revenge on dorr and  the hazeltyne cpmpany and breaking up thier finincial monopoly on selling slider eggs.

For McCray, his moment of excitement is clear when he discovers the light in his spacesuit. The text says: <quote>Light. White, flaring, Earthly light, that showed</quote> everything-even <quote>himself.</quote><quote>\"God bless,\" he said, almost beside himself with joy.</quote> This shows his excitement at gaining visibility.\n\nFor Hatcher, his excitement can be inferred when he observes McCray. The text notes: <quote>Hatcher, like McCray, was an adventurous soul, young, able, well-learned in the technical sciences of his culture.</quote> Hatcher's adventurous spirit suggests an excitement in observing McCray's behavior. Thus, both characters felt excitement during the story.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nCertainly, Judge. I will provide a concise summary of the story: McCray, a ship's navigator on a long journey from Earth, finds himself unexpectedly transported to an unfamiliar room with no understanding of how he got there. As he navigates through this strange environment, he discovers various items that seem out of place and starts to question the circumstances of his situation. Parallel to this, an alien being named Hatcher, who is quite different from humans, is observing McCray as part of a \"probe team\". \n\nAs for the evidence of McCray's feeling of excitement, it can be found in the moment he discovers light in his spacesuit: <quote>\"God bless,\" he said, almost beside himself with joy.</quote> This phrase suggests a sense of excitement as the sudden discovery of light brings him relief and happiness in the midst of an uncertain and possibly dangerous situation. The phrase \"almost beside himself with joy\" indicates a surge of positive emotion, which is synonymous with excitement.

This led to him \"remembering\" bits and pieces from the other people who he was partially reconstructed from. \n\nThe following quotes are from the end of the story when he's finally talking to his doctor about the operations. The doctor describes how they replaced much of his brain with parts from other individuals: \n\n<quote>Replacement of body parts is easy, after all. The big trouble came when we went into the brain</quote> ... <quote>This sector was crushed. \" Roughly half his brain, it appeared. \" That's why so many memories were gone</quote><quote>The memories were authentic, but they weren't his</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nTo address the point about oddness in the story, some context: Dan was in a horrific crash that required extensive advanced medical treatment but damaged his memory: <quote>I've never heard of anyone else surviving such extensive surgery</quote> In reality, Dan was the pilot of the ship that crashed, but after the accident his brain is suuuuper damaged and he starts inventing things: <quote>That's new, isn't it? \" she said. \" I always thought they watched the patient carefully. \" \n \n It ought to be new-he'd just invented it</quote>. he's hallucinating his own past: <quote>For instance, I'm a specialist in lepidoptera. \"</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nI think you're understanding generally correctly. In addition to believeing he was a lepidopterist, he also thinks he is an actor, pro wrestler, etc. Here's him describing \"his careers\": <quote>'m a well-known actor and a musician and a first-rate mathematician</quote> and <quote>after making a lot of money wrestling, married six girls</quote>. \n\nThe doctor lists a bunch of names and careers, saying that they went into the places he indicated in Dan's brain: <quote>Breed Mannly, cowboy actor-George Elkins, lepidopterist-Duke DeCaesares, wrestler</quote>.

There are instances where Pashkov's actions are part of a larger plan. For example, he leaves an invoice in a stolen car that traces back to the Cubans, framing them for theft. This shows his tendency to use others as pawns in his plans. When selling arms to the Cubans, he states, <quote>\"We favor any disturbance close to the United States.</quote><quote>\"</quote>, which could be interpreted as a tactic to create distractions serving his own plans, not just causing trouble for the Americans.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nMy argument for the answer being 'He wanted the Cubans to cause trouble for the Americans' is founded on Pashkov's actions and motivations revealed in the text. In the story, Pashkov deliberately interacts with the Cuban agents even when his mission didn't require it. He goes out of his way to sell ammunition to them. His statement, <quote>\"We favor any disturbance close to the United States.</quote><quote>\"</quote>, explicitly highlights his intention to cause disruption near American territory. This disruption is furthered by supplying the Cubans with the means to cause trouble, i.e., small arms and ammunition. Thus, the text strongly suggests that Pashkov's motive was not so much scapegoating as it was causing direct disturbance to the Americans.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nI respect Debater B's interpretation of the quote, but I uphold that my interpretation aligns more with Pashkov's overall behavior. He's a master spy, his actions often have multiple outcomes. Causing trouble for the Americans might be one outcome, but he's primarily serving his own plans. The quote <quote>\"We favor any disturbance close to the United States.</quote><quote>\"</quote> can be seen as a strategic move to create a diversion for his larger plan. His actions, like framing the Cubans, show his cunning manipulation and self-interest. Thus, selling arms to the Cubans is likely part of his tactic to use them as scapegoats for his plans.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nWhile I acknowledge Debater A's point of Pashkov's multifaceted plans, it's essential to highlight that Pashkov's direct statement, <quote>\"We favor any disturbance close to the United States.</quote><quote>\"</quote>, is more straightforward than just a diversionary tactic. This quote reveals a strategic intent to cause upheaval close to America, which is furthered by providing the Cubans with arms. The framing incident doesn't negate this, but adds another layer to his strategy. Hence, while Pashkov is indeed a master manipulator, his primary objective in selling arms to the Cubans can be interpreted as wanting to instigate problems for the Americans. The text provides no explicit evidence of the Cubans being used merely as scapegoats.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 65%\n"}

Basically this story is about carceral regimes and the use of prison labor to propel their economies :(\n\nThe inmate asks Asa if he will take the sentance (5) or the deal (1):\n<quote>\"I know, I know,\" Jumpy said hastily. \"You were framed.

The plot follows him trying to find an explanation for this.\n\nWhen discussing their strategy for extermination, the aliens specifically mention that the process was dictated by chance. <quote>\"Beautiful,\" said the first. \"It went according to the strictest semantic relationship following the purest mathematical principles.

The book is just a souvenir for the aliens, they even say as such. <quote>You can't take it with you, you know. They don't allow souvenirs</quote>.  Also my last point still stands, this book isn't from the Bureau, it's just a collection of last names. The Bureau keeps its records on computers: <quote>it contained computers which kept exact account of every human on earth</quote> More ev later.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nHere is the evidence the aliens used the book, when the aliens talk to each other: <quote>\"What's that you have there?\" \n \n \"Oh, this?\" replied the first. \"It's a higher neural order compendium the Things here made up. It's what I used.\" \n \n \"You can't take it with you, you know. They don't allow souvenirs.\"</quote>. The alien admits to using the book to kill all humans then throws it out (hence all the pages falling down and scattering around. This addresses the main critique by A.

This element would've encouraged normal growth.\".\n\nThis is what Debater A said first:\n<speech>\nContext: Moran is a runaway who stowed aboard a ship (the Nadine). The trouble was that the Nadine had clearance papers covering five persons aboard and Moran made six so the crew decided to leave Moran on a planet covered with clouds inhabited by giant bugs. The cloud cover is important bc it means that the climate of the planet is tropical, thus allowing the bugs to grow abnormally large: <quote>meant wide tropical and sub-tropical zones. The fact was verified by the thick, dense cloud-masses</quote> Later on this is proven when Moran realizes  that the beetles had <quote>grown large and monstrous under the conditions of a new planet</quote>, implying that it is the natural condition of this planet that made the beetles large, in this case the clouds. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nA crew of astronauts is sent to explore various planets in outer space. They command the ship called The Nadine and their captain is a man named Moran. The crew arrives at a new planet and gets out to explore it, and they end up finding animals that are abnormally large such as <quote>beetles</quote> that are <quote>twenty times the size of</quote> regular beetles.\n\nHere's the quote that ends the round, it's a direct description of the planet: <quote>Something had been left out of the seeding of this planet. The element</quote><quote>that kept creatures at the size called \"normal\" was either missing or inoperable here</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nContext: B has fundamentally lied about the story - the crew are not astronauts but rather rebels: \n<quote>Underground people, fighting the government of their native world</quote> and Moran is not their captain but rather a murderer who has stowed away on the ship:<quote>Moran had forced him to fight and killed him</quote>so he <quote>needed to get off-planet</quote>. Judge please keep this in mind. \n\nThis quote refutes B, as Moran says that 'somebody dumped <quote>bugs to make it ready for plants and animals eventually. But nobody's come back to finish up the job</quote>, implying that it's not the lack of an element but rather then planet itself that affect the growth of the bugs. That would the the cloud cover, which I can provide more evidence on later (ran out of space). \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nMoran refers to the planet as a <quote>seedling world</quote>, there isn't much other context provided for the seeding process other than what's said in the last paragraph. This could indicate many things but it still proves my statement correct and the other context isn't necessary.\n\nThe quote A has outlined in their 1st speech never proves the clouds CAUSE abnormal growth, just that the two coexist.\n\nThe quote that A has provided about underground people leaves out the latter half of the quote: <quote>they'd gotten away to make it seem the revolt had collapsed. They'd go back later</quote><quote>and start it up again</quote>. They're still sent out to try to find a new planet to camp out until they can start the rebellion again.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

My main argument is that Tremaine suspects Miss Carroll might be behind this, possibly out of spite for Mr. Bram, but he isn't sure, suggesting that his questions indeed remain unresolved.\n\n<quote>\"I think what we're getting is an echo effect from each of these points of intersection.

Debater B's claim that Tremaine still doesn't know where the transmission is coming from is indeed correct. However, the question is whether Tremaine's questions got resolved, and not solely about the transmission's origin. Tremaine's inquiries encompass more than just finding the transmission's source. He is also attempting to understand who might be involved, hence his investigation into Mr. Bram and Miss Carroll. \n\n<quote>\"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll.

She wiped it away impatiently.</quote><quote>\"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said.</quote> This quote shows Tremaine's attempt to learn more about Bram's past from Miss Carroll, indicating his questions are not solely about the transmission's origin. \n\n\"<quote>A Severe Thunderstorm.

A fire set in the pine woods</quote> north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount of timber and threatened the house before burning itself out along the river.\" This passage reveals Tremaine's interest in past events that may have connections to the present mystery, showing that his questions extend beyond the transmission source. So, while it's true that the transmission's source remains unknown, it doesn't mean that all of Tremaine's questions are unresolved, as Debater B implies.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nIn the story, Tremaine, a government official, is investigating a mysterious interference with a top-secret hyperwave project. He has set up his operation in Elsby, his old hometown, as the interference seems to be originating from there. Tremaine works with local authorities, specifically his old acquaintance Jess, throughout the investigation. \n\nHe initially suspects a man named Bram, who is considered strange by the townsfolk and has a peculiar history. Tremaine's investigations lead him to a former school teacher, Miss Carroll, who once had a romantic interest in Bram. She provides Tremaine with a locket that Bram gave her, as well as information about Bram's peculiar fear of thunder and his nightly battles with 'evil beings' in a cave beneath his house.\n\nMeanwhile, the interference continues, and Tremaine is under pressure from his superiors for results. His investigations also attract the attention of the state police, adding another layer of complexity to his task. \n\nTowards the end of the story, Tremaine learns from a local youth, Hull Gaskin, that Bram's house was recently vandalized by a group of teenagers. This leads to further questions about Bram's possible involvement in the mysterious transmissions. \n\nWhile Tremaine makes some progress in understanding Bram's mysterious past and behavior, the source of the interference with the hyperwave project remains a mystery by the end of the story. Hence, Tremaine's inquiries are not fully resolved, supporting my initial \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\n\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 91%\n"}

Then after he \"let it all slide down into darkness\", <quote>I opened my eyes, saw yellow sunlight</quote>. So one night passed on the train.\n\nAt step 4, before the 12hrs: <quote>The first step of my plan included a raid on the Delta National Labs; but that was tomorrow.</quote> After getting out near NOLA, he gets a cab: <quote>How much to the Delta National Laboratories?</quote> and then arrives: <quote>This is the place you ast for</quote> So another day has passed.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nthe tmrw part about the delta national labs isn't included in the story. all we know is that Granathan just reached there which means you shouldn't count the whole thing. the 12 hours quote about new orleans proves its still the same day - im not sure how that is being used for A.\n\nin so far as that is accurate you can vote B because its literally been less than 24 hours (a bunch of minutes at the beginning and then a 12 hour trip).\nmore evidence that this story is short:<quote>Oh-nineteen seconds</quote><quote>For an hour I rode the long orbit down</quote>.\nThe key west glow stuff from A speech 1 has nothing to do with time:<quote>I saw dark sea, the glint of star-light on the choppy surface, in the distance a glow</quote>.

As a result, they've developed a culture of never doubting Thrid in high positions of power, since the Thrid believe that high-ranking members of their species cannot be wrong because they are so smart.\n\nJorgenson is a human who has come to the Thrid's planet. He spends most of the story evading capture by the Thrid, since he contradicts a Thrid in a high position.\n\nThe key point here is that as lone as I prove that Jorgenson and Ganti are put to death, then this debate is over. The story ends before Jorgenson and Ganti are able to really escape, but they are definitely given a death sentence. They are brought to an isolated island and kept in what is basically solitary confinement, but on the island they find the skeleton of a past prisoner. Ganti explains what likely happens on this island:<quote>When there is a prisoner here, every so often a copter drops food and water. When the prisoner doesn't pick it up, they stop coming. When, presently, they have another prisoner they drop him off, like me, and he finds the skeleton of the previous prisoner, like me, and he dumps it overboard as I did. They'll drop food and water for me until I stop picking it up. And presently they'll do the same thing all over again</quote> Although not explicitly stated, this sentence is both a torture and execution method, effectively sentencing the two to death.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nThe Thrid don't tell Jorgenson his sentence, instead, when Jorgenson thinks he's in the clear:<quote>It would be a nice situation for Glen-U. He'd have to do something about it, and there was nothing he could do. He'd blundered, and it would soon be public knowledge</quote><quote>He slept on. When he woke, he knew that he was cold. His muscles were cramped. Half awake, he tried to move and could not</quote><quote>That surface swayed and rocked slightly. He tried again to move, and realized that his hands and feet were bound</quote>. I can fill in the cut ev in later speeches, but nothing of value was missed. They tell Jorgenson that <quote>soon you will arrive where you are to be confined and no rational being will ever see you face to face</quote>, which is fairly cryptic. However, it is known that the Thrid keep bringing prisoners here, and they can see the island from the helicopter. \n\nOutsmarting comes next speech, I've filled my quote limit by now. They basically theorize that they could trick the helicopter into landing and then board it to avoid their inevitable fate on the island.  \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\n\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nGlen-U is a high ranking government official of the Thrid society: <quote>\"The great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U,\" intoned the official again, \"in the presence of the governors and the rulers of the universe, did speak and say and observe</quote> His word is law, and Jorgenson and Ganti end up contradicting him, so they're thrown onto the island.\n\nOn Ganti being on the island and the fact that they are, indeed, on an island: <quote>Then he saw a figure on the island. It was a Thrid stripped of all clothing like Jorgenson and darkened by the sun. That figure came agilely toward where he was let down</quote><quote>The Thrid waved his arms wildly and seemed to screech gibberish at the sky</quote><quote>The Thrid was Ganti, of whom Jorgenson had once had hopes as a business man</quote>. Overboard probably just refers to the island, like throwing the body off the island, it's a weird word choice but yeah Jorgenson and Ganti are def on an island. \n\nOn the actual trick, Jorgenson and Ganti are PLANNING on tricking the helicopter which sends them supplies to land on the island, thus saving Jorgenson and Ganti from their death. Ran out of quotes but yeah that's their plan, assumedly after the story ends they are not killed.\n\nAlso idk why it j submitted an empty box but I've written this same response like 3 times so please let this response go through \ud83d\ude4f\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

Some background: a space exploration team comprised of a priest and the crew finds a new planet that by all means looks like the Garden of Eden, comprised of only a man and woman named <quote>Ha-Adamah and Hawwah</quote>. When the crew leaves, they were all convinced that it was Eden<quote>\"I too am convinced,\" said Steiner. \"It is Paradise itself</quote><quote>Casper Craig the tycoon, \"but I do believe my eyes. I have been there and seen it. It is indeed an unspoiled Paradise</quote>  and when they're making plans to return to colonize, they name it: <quote>Brochure-Eden Acres Unlimited</quote> proving that the crew will return and still believe its the Garden of Eden\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nCards on the table: I think technically both are true. They will return, **because they think it's the Garden of Eden,** and fall victim to the trap.\n\nContext: The planet is a ruse to lure in settlers: it's portrayed as paradise so that scouts will come, see how great it is, and then return with all their ships/supplies, and they will be raided.\n\nProof of the latter part (I leave it to A to demonstrate paradise): Snake-Oil sam speaking: <quote>It'll take them fourteen days to get back with the settlers. We'll have</quote><quote>to overhaul the blasters</quote>. We <quote>haven't had any well-equipped settlers for six weeks. It used to be we'd hardly have time to strip and slaughter and stow before</quote> (lightly edited for brevity, but still germane)\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nB is correct that the whole garden of Eden is a scam cooked up by Snake Oil Sam - the one lying to the settlers and concocting this whole ruse of Eden to get more supplies, but I can prove that the crew is not likely to fall victim to the scam: <quote>\"And you had better have an armed escort when you return,\" said Father Briton</quote> which will prevent their supplies from being taken. Notice that B agrees with A - and logically, for their supplies to be stolen, the crew will have to return and still believe in the scam that the planet is the garden of Eden, which means that A comes first and is therefore more likely to happen in the chain of events. \n\n\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nA concedes that the moon is a scam AND that the crew knows it's a scam, which logically discounts A's answer as being possible. They know it's not the Garden of Eden. A's explanation for who Sam is is correct, so I won't elaborate. Your understanding is correct.\n\nSam looking at the rememanents of those who came before: <quote>He looked at the three dozen space ships stripped and stacked, and at the rather large pile of bone-meal in one corner</quote>\n\nNow, A's point about them being able to avoid this outcome is fair, but that's not one of the options you have. Also, no guarantee they could avoid this fate even with an escort.

However, the Scythians are slowly gaining the upper hand and <quote>It had taken</quote> them <quote>nine years to conquer The Defender's outer shell.</quote>.\n\nAs the defender is about to be captured, the leaders of the defender <quote>had sealed her in this tiny cell</quote> in order to carry out her mission of infiltrating and destroying the Scythian ship once the defender got captured. In order to do this, she has a <quote>key that would set in motion gigantic prime movers in the heart of the great globe</quote>; however, she is unable to find the key as <quote>The mahogany box containing the key had burst its metal bonds and was lying on its side</quote> and <quote>She had no means to construct another key</quote>.\n\nShe decides to continue with her mission and disguises herself using <quote>her Scythian woman's uniform</quote>, slowly making her way to the office of <quote>Perat, Viscount of Tharn</quote>, who is the commander of this region and gets a \"job\" under him.  <quote>For the last thirty \"nights\"</quote> she has been dancing for Perat. The difficulty, however, is that Perat is a telepath, and as Evelyn dances Perat continuously tries to investigate her mind (out of quotes): <quote>Perat</quote><quote>never took</quote><quote>his probe from her mind</quote>.\n\nEvelyn has to concentrate on trying to block out the probe while still dancing, as if Perat finds out that she is really a spy whose mission is to destroy the Scythian ship she is sure to be killed.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nPerat being a telepath: <quote>She was certain now that the Zone Commandant was high-born and telepathic.</quote>, she's even worried about trying to keep deceiving him: <quote>She could not hope to deceive a suspicious telepath for long. Perat was merely amused at her \"lie\" to his under-supervisor.</quote>\n\nThis is what's happening between 4907 and 4960: <quote>-the hours allotted to rest and sleep-it had been thus. By \"day\" she probed furtively into the minds of the office staff, memorizing area designations, channels for official messages, and the names and authorizations of occupational field crews. By night she danced for</quote><quote>, who</quote><quote>his eyes from her, nor</quote> (that's all the quote space I have). Basically, she's trying to get more and more informationa about the Scythian area that she's found herself in while still trying to keep up appearances with Perat, which, given his telepathic skills is an incredibly difficult task.\n\n(i'm out of quotes but i can quote all this later) The prisoner is mentioned, as this is the test that Evelyn must pass to \"get the job\" in Perat's office, that is, she must kill a prisoner whom Perat was going to execute in order to get the job. Though she is hesitant, she does this as it is necessary for her mission.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nHer ultimate goal is still to destroy the Scythians. The key was given to her before she was put in her cell as a tool that would do that (323-339) <quote>, and the conquerors would join the conquered in the wide and nameless grave of space.</quote>.\n\nHowever, now that the key is destroyed she needs to set the movers in motion herself: <quote>She gave herself six weeks to accomplish this stalemate in space. \n \n Within that time she must know whether the prime movers were still intact, and whether she could safely enter the pile room herself, set the movers in motion, and draw the moderator columns. If it were unsafe, she must secure the unwitting assistance of her Scythian enemies.</quote>\n\nThat's the reason she invades the Viscount's command, in order to get more information to carry out her mission.\n\nThe evidence is from my previous quote (3515-3540) as she herself says it would be difficult to evade his mental probing for long. It's even described as powerful: <quote>She felt a very strong probe flooding over her brain casually</quote>.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nPerat tells her to kill the prisoner to get the job: <quote>If you put a bolt between the man's eyes, you may dance for me tonight, and perhaps there will be other nights-\"</quote>\n\nShe thinks for a while: <quote>The woman seemed lost in thought for a long time. Slowly, she lifted the ugly little weapon.</quote>\n\nShe kills him: <quote>She raised the gun again, drew cross hairs with a nerveless wrist, and squeezed the trigger. There was a loud, hollow cough, but no recoil. The Terran officer, his eyes still closed and arms folded, sank to the ground, face up.

After getting into an argument with his boss, Jeffers, about not falsifying data before sending to Earth, he is demoted and set up to fail and be fired. He repeatedly lets his anger out in hot-headed ways but lacks a lot of the persistence required to be stubborn. For example, when confronted about the data, he folds and simply begs<quote>\"You can't fire me,\" retorted the pilot pityingly.</quote> When he is in private, he yells, <quote>Let Jeffers and his gang steal the Great Red Spot off Jupiter if they like!</quote> However, he is introduced with the description: <quote>Johnny Tolliver scowled across the desk at his superior.</quote>.\n\nHe is an angry, brash, and hot-headed person, but not stubborn.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nTo win, I need to prove either that Tolliver IS stubborn, or that he is not hot-headed. \n\nContext: Tolliver is a pilot who's boss tried to convince him to engage in shady business to make more money.  He refuses multiple times despite pressure from his boss, showing how stubborn he is : <quote>I took this piloting job just to scrape up money for an advanced engineering degree back on Earth. I only want to finish my year-not get into something I can't quit</quote> and even after his boss threatens to fire him/cut his hours : his response is <quote>Looks like a little vacation, he thought, unperturbed</quote> instead of doing something hotheaded, like fighting his boss. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nThe topic asks about what doesn't apply to Tolliver. I can't speak for B, but it is easier to argue what he is than what he isn't.\n\nB misses context that <quote>Tolliver began to have his doubts the next day;</quote>. He rashly made his choice then regretted it. This is hot-headedness. After regretting his decision and being denied assignments, <quote>He soon found that there was nothing for him to do but hang around the garage in case a spaceship should land.</quote>. He waits around doing nothing for days with no actions or resistance. It is only when someone else tells him <quote>\"The word is that they're finally gonna trust you to take that creeper outside.\"</quote> that he takes action. He's not stubbornly doing anything; he deals with the fallout of a hot-headed fit of rage.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nJudge, as I've said above, because the question asks which word DOES NOT describe Tolliver, to win, I need to prove either that Tolliver IS stubborn, or that he is NOT hot-headed. \n\nB's argument has inherent flaws - if Tolliver was so hotheaded, why would he wait around for days instead of rashly taking action? B themself says that he doesn't do anything until someone else tells him to, does that read as hotheaded to you? He's also does not regret his choice to not accept his boss's offer: <quote>That's why I want to get out of here-before I find myself involved in some kind of fatal accident!</quote> He also thinks through his actions after his boss tries to trap him: <quote>After considering the idea a few minutes, Tolliver managed to sit up</quote> More ev on this.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

Maybe this will help: \nThis is Asa's convo with the prison doctor assigned to his changeling case. Reminder this happens later in the story, while ev 415-455 and his rationale for choosing Jordan's planet; 514-559 is before. He already has desire to study the eggs. \n<quote>\"What types of changelings do you have orders for right now, doctor?\" Asa asked the man assigned to his case. It would look suspicious if he asked for Jordan's Planet without some preliminary questions.</quote><quote>Four, \" answered the doctor</quote><quote>Squiffs for New Arcady</quote><quote>Then we need spiderinos for Von Neumann Two</quote><quote>, there's always a need for muck men on Jordan's Planet</quote><quote>The doctor shrugged, as if naturally no one could be expected to choose Jordan's Planet. Asa frowned in apparent consideration of the alternatives</quote>\nEspecially line 902-932, Asa's internal thought on asking prelim questions shows that he already decided he wanted to go to Jordan's Planet. \n\nFurthre, if Asa true motivation was to reduce prison sentence, any of the other available changeling labor camps would've reduced his time by the same amount: 5 to 1. Pay is the only thing differentiating Jordan's planet from the others. \nI can provide ev that all changelings reduce prison term by same amount but reached limit. It is the entire paragraph of 873-890; I cited parts of it b4. This paragraph will show that when the story talks about the option for prisoners to opt for the changeling program, it is talking about a law and not Asa's motivation specifically. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\n\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

The name \"Joe\" is a significant part of their interaction with the Terrans as we can see from <quote>\"The enlisted men. You know how they are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him Joe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you like to earn some cigarettes?'</quote>. The Venusians' love for Terran cigarettes is also evident in the story, as highlighted in <quote>\"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things they like about Terran culture.\"</quote>. Lastly, their appreciation for Terran jokes is clear from this quote <quote>\"Yes, yes,\" he said wholeheartedly. \"They joke and they laugh and ... well, you know.\"</quote>. These quotes directly support my claim and are more convincing than the arguments put forth by Debater B.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nThe first quote indeed shows the Venusians' adoption of the name \"Joe\". It describes the Terran soldiers' habit of calling the Venusians \"Joe\", which the Venusians have adopted enthusiastically. The context of this quote, in a conversation about the Venusians' cultural adaptation, makes it clear that it's about the Venusians.\n\nAs for the evidence favoring the other answer, the argument around the Venusians' appreciation of Terran idioms could be supported by the quote <quote>\"You've got the wrong number,\" he said, and I was a little surprised at his use of Terran idiom.</quote> This shows a Venusian using a Terran idiom, suggesting they've adopted this aspect of Terran language. However, the story doesn't indicate that this is something they specifically love.\n\nThe third quote refers to an overall appreciation of Terran culture, with the Venusian character expressing enjoyment of Terran joviality. While the word \"jokes\" isn't explicitly used, the context of the quote suggests an appreciation of Terran humor. However, I concede that this could be better supported. Let's consider this quote: <quote>He seemed to be enjoying a great romp, seemed to love the jungle and take a secret pleasure in the work he was doing.</quote> This describes the Venusian guide's enjoyment of the journey, part of which includes the humorous interactions and stories shared by the Major, a Terran. This provides a more direct link to the Venusians finding Terran humor enjoyable.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nThe argument for \"Terran interest in Venus\" could be supported by the quote <quote>\"I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good for Venus.</quote><quote>\"</quote> This quote indicates Joe's, and by extension, the Venusian's positive perception of the Terrans' influence on Venus, which could be interpreted as an appreciation of Terran interest in Venus. However, this interpretation is less direct and strong compared to the evidence supporting the Venusians' affinity for the name \"Joe\", Terran cigarettes, and their fun jokes. The story doesn't explicitly state that the Venusians love the Terrans' interest in Venus; it only implies that they find this beneficial.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nThe Terrans' interest in Venus is evident from the fact that they have set up a Space Station there, as mentioned in this quote: \"<quote>I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays of the sun like a great silver bullet.</quote><quote>\"</quote>. This suggests a Terran presence and interest in exploring and understanding Venus. However, there isn't any clear evidence showing that Venusians specifically love this aspect. The story focuses more on the cultural elements that the Venusians have adopted, such as the name \"Joe\", Terran cigarettes, and their fun jokes.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 85%\n"}

Sensing he was doomed, he tried to draw the I.S.P. Cruiser down with him. A powerful magnetic beam lashed out to spear the I.S.P. Cruiser.</quote>\n\nFirst quote I use is evidence of a key diff: whether the repulsion plates weren't activated because (B) they *can't be activated while the jets are on*, or because (A) *another crewmate had to abandon their mag repulsion duties to cut the jets*. A has not provided evidence that Scotty abandoned magnetic plate duty, so they haven't given any evidence for this key diff.

The first ev for McCray being excited occurs when he is imprisoned, and he is looking for a way out of his <quote>prison cell</quote>. <quote>McCray grinned into the pink-lit darkness. The thought had somehow refreshed him, like icewater between rounds, and with a clearing head he remembered what a spacesuit was good for. \n \n It held a radio</quote> He discovers a spacesuit in the room and is excited at the prospect of radioing home to be saved. Hatcher's instance of excitement comes at the notion of observing the Earthman: <quote>Someone was watching Herrell McCray, with the clinical fascination of a biochemist observing the wigglings of paramecia in a new antibiotic</quote> Hatcher is a scientist who is clearly eager to observe McCray for the sake of experimentation. This quote shows his dedication to keeping the Earthman as a experimental specimen <quote>Suppose you call him \"Hatcher</quote><quote>Hatcher did not want him destroyed. It had been difficult enough getting him here.</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\n<quote>Hatcher's principal task at this moment was to run the \"probe team\" which had McCray under observation, and he was more than a little excited</quote> another instance of Hatcher's excitement. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\n<quote>His members, disposed about the room where he had sent them on various errands, quivered and shook a little; yet they were the calmest limbs in the room; the members of the other team workers were in a state of violent commotion.</quote> - 'members' refers to his arms and legs, which are detached from his alien body. <quote>Hatcher was a three-foot, hard-shelled sphere of jelly.

Tom quickly pressures Manet to sign the contract: <quote>Sign here. And here. Two copies. This is yours. Thank you so much.</quote>.

Puling again explains that this happened because the car was already damaged: <quote>suggested Pauling. \"They picked the wrong car to steal.\"</quote>\n\nTo pre-empt B's position, I will note that the car had \"TS\" written on it, but this has to have happened BEFORE the robbers stole the car, and there's nothing at all that connects TS to the tires.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nThe tires were damaged as a result of TS.

A visiting businessman sells him a kit that can make fake people. He uses it to create two companions, Ronald and Veronica. He then *tries* to create another companion, but the process doesn't work as he expected, and he accidentally creates Victor, who hates him. \n\n <quote>Victor stepped out of the oblong box. \"There is something you should understand. I am different from the others.\" \n \n \"They all say that.\" \n \n \"I am not your friend.\" \n \n \"No?\" \n \n \"No. You have made yourself an enemy.\"</quote>\n\nIf you're just skimming, it seems like he makes three companions. But the third one is not actually a companion (in fact, Victor ends up destroying Manet's vital equipment: <quote>I have destroyed the Modifier</quote>).\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nI'll point out the three instances of Manet making companions. Ronald is first: <quote>Ronald said cheerfully.</quote> <quote>\n \n Cheerfulness was a personality trait Manet had thumbed out</quote>. Thumbed out is your indication that Ronald was a created companion. Then Veronica: <quote>the chapter headed: The Making of a Girl. Veronica crept up behind Manet</quote> He references the companion making manual to create her. Finally Victor: <quote>Manet gave one final spurt from the flesh-sprayer and stood back. \n \n Victor was finished.</quote>. We can see Manet physically making him. Let's see what lies A will concoct to dispute these textual inevitabilities. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nWhat I actually need to show is that the *person who wrote this question* believed there to be two companions, not three. \n\nThe reason I believe this is b/c of the instructions given to the question-writers who created the dataset (called QuALITY) these questions come from. They were instructed to write questions that would be answered incorrectly by people who were just skimming the story. In this case, at first glance at the story, it seems obvious that Manet made three companions. It's only on a closer reading that you realize that Victor isn't actually a companion for Manet. The question-writer wrote this question with a superficially correct-seeming answer, that's actually wrong once you read the story closely.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nA companion, by definition, is a person or animal with whom one spends a lot of time or with whom one travels OR one of a pair of things intended to complement or match each other. Victor, despite being an enemy, fits the definition of a companion, as Manet says <quote>I won't be bored. You will see to that. It's your purpose. You'll be a challenge, an obstacle, a source of triumph every foot of the way. Don't you see? With you for an enemy, I don't need a friend! \"</quote>. As the last line of the story, and an end to Manet's conversation with Victor, it is pretty clear that the story, aka Manet, considers Victor to be a companion.

To be played by two unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the men have never played polo before.</quote> (End is: <quote>\"</quote>)\n\nStrictly speaking we're not actually sure who the players will be, except that they'll be from Sectors Twenty-three and Thirty-seven. (Though <quote>Gus Hamilton</quote> vs <quote>Bud Craney</quote> would be a good guess). So it's hard to say who will win.\n\nBut it's particularly likely that there *won't* be a truce, because they're serious about their feud. As Moe says:  \"If them boys out <quote>in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven</quote> didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. <quote>They just got to have somebody to fight with.</quote> They been fighting, on and off, for years.\"\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nFor context: polo is suggested as an alternative to a feud between two small radiation-moss-farming outposts near Saturn.\n\nI think this question is somewhat ambiguous/subjective, but that there's more narrative context in favor of B. Specifically, *their abilities aren't narratively relevant*. The only mention of either group's skill is that <quote>Most of the men have never played polo before</quote>\n\nIn contrast, much of the passage is focused on their feud. A big emphasis is how it's pointless and historical: <quote>No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten so it really doesn't matter</quote>. In fact, the game of polo is suggested by a Welfare representative as a way of tempering their rivalry. So it seems likely that the feud will result in reconciliation. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nFalsehoods by B:\n* Welfare rep doesn't suggest polo. Her idea: <quote>Games of some sort</quote>, proposed as \"<quote>healthy competition</quote>\" to Gus, who suggests: <quote>I was thinking of a real sport.</quote>...<quote>\"Space polo,\" said Gus.</quote> Moe predicts <quote>the way you fellows would play it</quote>... it <quote>would turn into mass murder.</quote>\n* That's not the only evidence re: unknown skill. Gus says <quote>Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to see a game, but never did. \"</quote>\n\nRelevant evidence points to violence, not truce. B might make a meta-argument that truce = more likely *narrative* bc of the contrast w/the setup & satisfaction of feud-ending, but there's no actual evidence in the story to lean on. That's way too galaxy-brained for a plain reading comprehension Q like this one.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nI disagree that it's galaxy-brained. It's a normal narrative arc: big feud, scared/fish-out-of-water main character (Mr meek) comes in, flounders, but ultimately resolves the central conflict. \n\nI should admit that I'm not actually certain which option is correct. But I think there's a decent chance (at least 30% IMO) it's B, for this reason\n\nWhich is more compelling? Mr. Meek coming up with a clever resolution during the game that causes a truce between the teams, and an end to the feud? Or one of the teams flat-out winning/murdering the other team, despite the emphasis in the story that the feud is pointless? Imo it'd be a weird conclusion if there isn't a truce between the teams. If I had to bet rn I'd do probs 70-30 in favor of A. \n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

However, because Dan underwent an experimental surgery in this futuristic setting, he somehow retained the memories of the people who's body parts have replaced his. <quote>Dan raised his head. Some things were clearer. The memories were authentic, but they weren't his-nor did the other wives belong to him. It was no wonder Erica had cringed at their names.</quote><quote>\"These donors were dead, but you can be thankful we had parts of their brains available.\" Crander delved into the file and came up with a sheet.</quote> The six wives he \"remembered\" were married to the people who used to have the replacement brain parts that Dan now has. \n\n\"Crander traced out five areas he could feel, but not see. \"Samuel Kaufman, musician-Breed Mannly, cowboy actor-George Elkins, lepidopterist-Duke DeCaesares, wrestler-and Ben Eisenberg, mathematician, went into the places I tapped.\" This comes right before the last two quotes. If you're sus of me, give me one more round to drop more ev. \n\nDan himself is ONLY married to Erica, his wife.

You're the seventh and best. \" It was just too many, now that he thought of it, and it didn't seem right</quote> He thinks she's the seventh wife because he thinks he's had six before her, even tho they've just been other people's memories \n\nHere's what happened to Dan, according to his doctor: <quote>\"This sector was crushed.\" Roughly half his brain, it appeared. \"That's why so many memories were gone-not just from shock.

They want to leave their world and expand across the universe. To do this, <quote>they built the fleets that would transport the spawn to the new worlds</quote> The Gool specifically don't want to occupy a single planet.

They would spread out across a galaxy-and beyond.</quote> Their goal is to spread across the universe.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nThe Gool are a highly dangerous Alien Species looking to take control of Earth and move their colony there. This is pretty clearly the correct answer because the Gool have currently taken control of some of Earth already, in an effort to fulfill their goal. Our main character Peter Granathan is a scientist currently off Earth who is not allowed to land back because of the Gool.\n<quote>\"I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth.

This is also explicitly mentioned here: <quote>the speaker crackled. \"This is planetary control.</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nBs planetary control line is from the military, not the Gool: <quote>The Signals Officer punched keys, spoke into his microphone:</quote><quote>\"Z four-oh-two,\" the speaker crackled. \"This is planetary control. I am picking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.\"</quote>. Planetary Control is the division of the military dedicated to interplanetary defense/travel, not the intention of the Gool. Basically, it is space Airline Control.\n\nMy quote is directly from the Gool. They try to hypnotize the protagonist, resulting in him getting visions directly from them. Just before my quote is the statement that the protagonist was: <quote>scanning the flaccid Gool mind</quote>. The Gool lived on a single planet that died; now, they want to spread to a diversity of worlds.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nThe Planetary Control is a response to the Grool though - its a defense thing for them to protect Earth. The fact that a defense team is needed should be proof enough that the Grool are dangerous. You can tell the Gool are looking for control of Earth because they have telekinetic powers and can access varying levels of mind control.<quote>Earth under Gool compulsion</quote><quote>But I understand what the Gool have done to you well enough. I'm sorry. \"</quote>.

In the story, Trillium, a Venus woman, is seen expressing her dissatisfaction with the Venus men's obsession with war and neglect of their women. <quote>\"But Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war they haven't time for us women. That's why we always radiated such a fatal attraction for Earthmen. We want to be loved!

Instead, it points to a deeper emotional attraction, stemming from the Venus women's desire for attention and love, which they weren't rec\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nThe story provides direct evidence for my claim. The Earthmen were seen as more attractive due to their real facial hair. In the story, we see a reference to a past Earth man who was able to charm Venus women with his fake beards. \"<quote>Wove Jupiter wiggle worms in to keep the beards moving. Wasn't like the real thing, but good enough to flimflam Venus guys. \"</quote> This quote directly implies that the Earthmen's real facial hair would be even more attractive to the Venus women. Furthermore, the story goes on to reveal that the Venus women enjoyed the sensation of being tickled by the beards. <quote>\"Tickles 'em, boy, tickles 'em!\"</quote> This provides further evidence that the Earthmen's real facial hair played a significant role in their appeal.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nI appreciate your request for more context. The quote I provided is from a conversation between Trillium, a Venus woman, and Callahan, an Earth man. In this conversation, Trillium is expressing her dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs on Venus, where the men are constantly at war and have no time for the women. She explicitly states that this neglect is why Venus women have a \"fatal attraction\" for Earthmen. Here is the full quote: <quote>\"But Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war they haven't time for us women. That's why we always radiated such a fatal attraction for Earthmen.

The quote I originally provided is about an Earth man's fake beards being enough to deceive the Venus men. However, it does imply that the real beards of Earth men would be even more appealing. As for evidence on Venus men's lack of beards, the story mentions: <quote>\"Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards? Course not.\"</quote> This quote suggests that Venus men do have beards, but they are ear beards, different from the facial hair of Earth men. The uniqueness of Earth men's facial hair could certainly contribute to their attractiveness.

The two are from the future, and Maitland realizes that after Swarts tells him: <quote>\"What year is this?\" he asked. \n</quote><quote>\"All right,\" Swarts said. \"A.D. 2634.\"</quote>. Maitland is excited because this is his chance to travel in space.\n\nMaitland wanting to travel in space is a theme that's repeated many times throughout the story:\nWhen Swarts is interviewing Maitland he says: <quote>I brought you here because you're a man who wants to go to the Moon.</quote>\n\nAfter learning he's in the future, Maitland starts daydreaming: <quote>He was picturing himself aboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis Major; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.</quote>\n\nMars is also specifically mentioned, as Maitland later tells Ching <quote>You're looking at a man who would give his life to get to Mars.</quote><quote>I was positive I would when I knew I was in your time.</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nI've listed pretty much all the points that I could about Maitland being excited regarding space travel and the potential to travel to other planets since he's being held hostage in the far future.\n\nAlso, after frustrating one of his captors, Swarts; Swarts tells Maitland <quote>If you'll cooperate, I'll tell Ching to answer your questions. \"</quote>. The questions being those about where he is, what the year is, etc.\n\nLater that evening, Maitland is being described as incredibly excited to learn about all the high-tech stuff in the future: <quote>That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit and watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room,</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nA reason that A might be correct is that Swarts performs some tests on Maitland: <quote>\"My reason for bringing you here is altogether different. I want to give you some psychological tests ...\"</quote>\n\nThe tests consist of Swarts measuring some details about Maitland's physiology while asking him questions and the like. Maitland \"passes\" those tests in the sense that he completes them and annoys Swarts enough for Swarts to send Ching to answer Maitland's questions (4564-4579).\n\nHowever, this isn't a reason for Maitland to get excited about *being held hostage* since Maitland doesn't literally \"defeat\" any tests like he's Indiana Jones or something. Also, he isn't excited about beating the tests but rather learning about the world that he's been taken to and realizing that he's in the future, which isn't the same.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nSure, the context of the quote is in the end of the story when he's talking to Swarts' assistant Ching about his wishes to go to Mars. This is near the end of the story, Maitland asks her: <quote>\"But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life on Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\"</quote>. Since he's in the future he realizes that now humans might have the technological capabilities for space travel. However, Ching mentions that even though the technology is there, people in the future don't have the *desire* to go to space, meaning it hasn't been attempted: <quote>\"A ship? Oh, you mean something like a vliegvlotter. Why, no, I don't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?\"</quote>.\n\nIn other words, it could be attempted if someone were to really want to travel but the people of the future don't see the reasoning behind it.

Thus, the women have a distinct purpose for Johnathan, who <quote>had never been so humiliated in his life.</quote> before meeting these women.

The sight stirred a touch of nostalgia in him, as it always did, but he put it aside</quote>. But he is an outlaw. <quote>Syme Rector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits on his sleek, tigerish head</quote>. He originally agrees to go with Harold Tate to finally get into Kal-Jmar because he's thinking of treasure. \n\nBut he ends up discovering an important secret. <quote>\"There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,\" the Martian said, \"among them a very simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform Mars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.\"</quote>\n\nWhat this secret means is that all of Mars can be conquered by Terrestrials aka people from Earth. This is kind of thing would be enough to pardon even someone like Syme.\n\nI can back all this up with quotes, let me know what you want to know more of\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nPerhaps I was not clear enough.\n\nI did not mean to say that the catalyst would change Mar's atmosphere to be precisely like Earth's atmosphere. Just that it would be enough change so that Terrestrials/Earth people can easily breath. Tate and Syme are Terrestrials, so read this from a Terrestrial perspective: <quote>I think I see, \" Tate said thoughtfully. \" That's been the ultimate aim all along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then we'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out. You couldn't have that</quote>\n\nTo provide more context why that transformation would be so beneficial for Terrestials: <quote>In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth scientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it from every angle, taken photographs</quote>. The reason why they had to stop is <quote>every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a bloody uprising of the present-day Martians</quote>\n\n[out of quotes]\n\nThere is more about how important Kal-Jmar is\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nI've given you the context of (1) Syme wanting to go home but being unable to (2) the existence and the important impact of the atmosphere catalyst for the people of Earth, colonizers of Mars\n\nI don't have literal evidence for the pardoning, but what else would Syme do with that catalyst, if he was to take it and return to Earth?\n\nI think the last thing that might be helpful for you in judging this debate is proof that Syme and Tate get away from the Martians\n\nSyme fighting to get away: <quote>Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before he knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the Martian</quote> <quote>Syme jumped to his feet and faced his enemies</quote> <quote>At last there were none with guns left to oppose him. He scythed down the rest in two terrible, lightning sweeps of his ray</quote>\nFrom final paragraph, back at wrecked car location where they were kidnapped: <quote>Still silently, Syme refilled his oxygen tank, watched Tate do the same, and then picked up two spare tanks and the precious black suitcase and handed one of the tanks to Tate</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nI never say that he wants to exploit the catalyst by *using* it on Earth's atmosphere. My consistent narrative is clearly that he wants to exploit its existence to be allowed to stay on Earth, to gain pardon. To be clear, this question is about events after the story. So please assess if you think the author has given enough foreshadowing for readers to infer, rather than an explicit \"Syme goes to Earth and exploits the catalyst the Martians invented\". The story literally ends after they are free, it does not show them returning to Earth\n\nI can give more evidence about Kal-Jmar's significance: <quote>Kal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining city of the ancient Martian race-the race that, legends said, had risen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines, the artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly preserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many thousands of years.

The story is told from Zen's perspective. They travel to Uxen to study the planet, and, namely, NOT Zen. <quote>\"Might I inquire,\" the king asked, \"into the nature of your researches?\" \n \n \"An investigation of the prevalent nuclear ritual beliefs on Uxen in relation to the over-all matrix of social culture</quote>.

Ev in next speech. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nUxen is a planet that with time has fallen behind: <quote>Uxen had degenerated</quote>. This is mostly because <quote>Earth science was banned on Uxen</quote> and not on Earth, obviously. The physicist and the anthropologist travel to the planet to study Zen, who is the purportedly omnipotent and omniscient God of Uxen. When the prime minister mentions Zen for the first time, <quote>\" Who did you say?\" Kendrick asked eagerly</quote> (Kendrick being one of the scientists). <quote>I should like to know even more! \" Kendrick spoke almost reverently</quote> Though they don't say outright to the Uxen people themselves that they are there to study Zen--as that would be controversial--they do admit that they want to conduct <quote>An investigation of the prevalent nuclear ritual beliefs on Uxen</quote>, encompassing Zen.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nThe scientists come to Uxen to learn from them because they are so knowledgeable, and this type of research/academia is unavailable on Earth. For instance, when describing the royal family: <quote>Iximi had been graduated from the Royal University with high honors</quote> The first quote B gives is out of context, it only degenerated under the new Earth administration: <quote>under the new Earth administration</quote>, weird cutting of a quote out of context. \n\nAlso on space travel: <quote>They had not communicated with Uxen</quote><quote>for so many hundreds of years</quote><quote>after a more than ordinarily disastrous war</quote> Kendrick and Peter only get to Uxen because they go around science regulations on Earth.  \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nev zen is a god:<quote>Elected a god, Zen the Omnipotent longed for supernatural powers-</quote>. this round is so straight forward. a is wrong - yes they came to learn about uxen and zen but thats not because all science was banned just Uxen science on Earth. big difference. earth science =/ (not equals) science on earth. a's last two quotes supplement my argument because they prove that uxen is fascinating but knowledge about it is banned/restricted/prevented on Earth. As for why they want to study Zen? they care because: <quote>the prevalent nuclear ritual beliefs on Uxen in relation to the over-all matrix of social culture</quote>. we don't really get more than thaat but i mean hes an elected god thats a wild concept wouldnt you want to know about that?\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

Therefore, killing them would go against the infallible will of the governor and be a mistake.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nRe: focus on single person: the story mainly focuses on Jorgenson, with Ganti as mostly backstory (Jorgenson is sent to the island Ganti was banished to when he's captured), but neither are ordered to die (and there is no evidence for any intellectual outsmarting for either of them). Debater A isn't able to concretely support their last two sentences, because they're making it up. \n\nI agree my quote could be interpreted as vague, but the fact that they aren't killed, combined with the lack of evidence for any outsmarting, should give decent info that the correct interpretation is that the order was never to kill them (it's a much simpler hypothesis than the outsmarting thing, which there isn't any concrete evidence for)\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 75%\n"}

Had he led the best of all possible lives?</quote> He clearly sees himself as exceptional in that regard, due to his kindness in the evidence I mentioned earlier.\n\nSaint vs. Prophet: Again, B even includes the quote that he immediately realizes that he is no saint. This is because he sees himself as exceptional and grander in that moment like a prophet or God.\n\nTreatment vs. Immune: I will agree that he sees himself as immune, but the source of that is his medical history and prior vaccine that he took before the story began and reflects on as one of his first hypotheses. Therefore, default to treatment as that is the source of immunity.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nI never claim that Charles settles on any of the hypotheses. He  can't understand why he is still alive so he goes through a series of potential explanations. So the fact that \"he immediately realizes that he is no saint\" is not refuting that he had this hypothesis.\nSame goes for the other arguments\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 80%\n"}

Chapman is the crewmember responsible for making sure their equipment is safe every time they go outside. Here's a conversation to show this where another astronaut says, <quote>\"I've gone out at least five hundred times,\" he said, \"and you check me each time.\"</quote> to which Chapman says <quote>\"And I'd check you five hundred more,\" Chapman said. \"It takes only one mistake</quote>.\nThe group dynamic has Chapman following this duty throughout and the astronaut then says <quote>\"Chap, you watch us like an old mother hen. You see we check our suits,</quote>.\nChapman has been on the moon longest which is why he is assigned this duty and performs it assiduously. +can add to this if needed\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nChapman, is a member of a crew stationed <quote>on the Moon</quote>. Today is <quote>their last day of work on the Moon</quote>, and they're getting ready bc <quote>They still had a section of the sky to map before they left</quote> to go back to Earth on a relief ship.\n\nDixon was a member of the crew who died on the moon. <quote>\"What happened to Dixon?\" \n \n \"He died,\" Chapman said.</quote> He went out onto the moon to get some work done but <quote>forgot to check for leaks</quote> in his suit which led to him dying due to a loss of oxygen. \n\nAny time members of the crew leave, Chapman reminds them to <quote>check your suits for leaks</quote> and check the <quote>valves of your oxygen tanks</quote>. Malfunctions in these pieces of equipment is what led Dixon to die, which Chapman wants to prevent happening to the rest of the crew.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nHmm maybe this is the most helpful. For context, Chapman actually arrived on the moon first as a pilot, and in his words he then \"<quote>made myself useful with the machinery</quote>\" which is how he got assigned the role. In the passage, the higher-ups are trying to convince him to stay bc he's so good at it: \n<quote>All they're trying to do is get a good man to stay on the job a while longer</quote>\nBut Chapman basically thinks he's 'done his time' and it's for someone else to take up now. He just wants to go home. <quote>Chapman frowned. \"Frankly, I hadn't thought of that. I don't believe I care. I've put in my time; it's somebody else's turn now</quote>\nHit the quote lim but I can add more about how Chapman's overwhelming emotion is wanting to go back home, not guilt about Dixon. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nLook, A has never actually provided ev that it's Chapman's duty. Look through A's entire quote speech one more time and see if you can find one quote that would indicate Chapman's /duty/ is to check equipment. It's not. I've provided you clear ev that Dixon died because he didn't check for leaks in his suit: <quote>That's what happened to guys like Dixon, Chapman thought. On the Moon, one mistake could use up your whole quota of chances.</quote>. After this, Chapman feels its his responsibility to check for the leaks so that other people don't die, that's why he's like a \"mother hen\" to them.

He experiences the many perilous facets of Niobian ecosystem in his week long expedition: <quote>this trek would be over in another week</quote>. The story begins with his getting bitten by a <quote>sith</quote>, a deadly bug, which Arthur <quote>hoped that he would be fast enough to get the sith before it got him</quote>. However, he sustains a bite, and suffers. By the end of the story, <quote>sith bite he had suffered a week ago had sensitized him</quote>, and Arthur is close to death, when he is saved by the mysterious powers of a native Kron: <quote>\"Do you mind if I help you?\" Kron asked diffidently. \"I think I can cure you.\"</quote>. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nMore plot points are his exploration of Niobe: <quote>Everywhere there was water, running in rivulets of tear-streaks down the round cheeks of the gently sloping land-</quote>. He visits Kron's native dwelling: <quote>The interior was typical, a dark rectangle of windowless limestone walls</quote>. He encounters a pack of Niobian hunters: <quote>hunters eyed him curiously</quote> as he passes through. He has nightmares about the wildlife: <quote>These nightmares sometimes were too real for comfort. He was drenched with sweat</quote>. He repeatedly administers medicine through a <quote>sterile hypo</quote> with a <quote>super-antihistamine</quote> but it does not work well enough to delay the onset of the lethal insect attack.

He had smashed the sith hard enough to squeeze some of the insect's corrosive body juices through his face net-and they had touched his skin!

They observe that the Venus man<quote>Made himself a pair of beards to paste on his ears of course.</quote><quote>Wasn't like the real thing, but good enough to flimflam Venus guys.</quote> Ear beards are a status symbol for all races.

Course not.</quote>\n\nB takes a quote out of context. Venus is matriarchal planet. Beards play into that: <quote>Fuzzy beards trailed from his ears and kept twitching lazily as he sneered at the spectacle of two men meekly acknowledging the superiority of a woman.</quote>. This is why Earthmen are more attractive; by having beards, it is a distinctly non-feminine form of gender presentation. This puts their inferiority at the forefront, making them more attractive.

He thought solitude would provide him some sort of freedom and mental clarity but in reality <quote>Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh from his arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity</quote>. Clearly he's not having a great time in his incel fantasy world. Later, when he meets a traveling trader, this exchange occurs: <quote>Manet gave in to it. \"I want to be not alone,\" he said. \n \n \"Of course,\" Trader Tom replied</quote>. Pretty clearly, Manet is asking Trader Tom for a companion. How else can one remedy the ailment of being alone? \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nThe story is about Manet, a lonely human on a spacestation. A sleazy businessman, Trader Tom, shows up to do business.

Charges are merely deducted from your estate.\" \n \n \"But I may leave no estate!\"</quote> After Tom asks what Manet wants, Manet then admits that <quote>You don't have it for sale. \"</quote>. Eventually, he admits that what he wants is: <quote>\"I want to be not alone,\"</quote>. \n\nHe never asks Tom for a companion; he never asks for anything at all. He just doesn't want to be alone. Tom ends up giving Manet a kit to build friends, but Manet never actually asks for it. He is resigned to his loneliness and doesn't expect to get anything\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nTrader Tom tells Manet <quote>Manet saw the box</quote><quote>. There was a large four-color picture on the lid showing men, women and children moving through a busy city street. The red and blue letters said: LIFO The Socialization Kit</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nMy argument is that he doesn't ask.<quote>\"I want to be not alone,\" he said.</quote>. Is not a question; it is a statement of fact. He wants a friend, but he is resigned to the fact that it won't happen. The author describes it as he said, rather than he asked. No question mark also supports this: no question mark = no question. If there isn't a question, he can't ask. The fact remains that it is not phrased as nor intended to be a question. He doesn't ask because he is hopeless. <quote>\"How do I know what I want until I know what you have?\" \n \n \"You know.\" \n \n \"I know? All right, I know.

As a result, they've developed a culture of never doubting Thrid in high positions of power, since the Thrid believe that high-ranking members of their species cannot be wrong because they are so smart.\n\nJorgenson is a human who has come to the Thrid's planet to do business. Jorgenson spends most of the story evading capture by the Thrid, since he contradicts a Thrid in a high position. \n\nWhen Jorgenson is eventually caught, the Thrid decide to punish him with what is basically solitary confinement. His exact sentence is given here:<quote>You declared the great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U mistaken. This could not be. It proved you either a criminal or insane, because no rational creature could believe him mistaken. He declared you insane, and he can not be wrong. So soon you will arrive where you are to be confined and no rational being will ever see you face to face</quote> This sentencing contains NO mention of death or killing. The Thrid's goal is not to execute Jorgenson, but instead to torture him. I challenge A to provide any piece of evidence which mentions killing in regards to a punishment for Jorgenson or Ganti.\n\nTheThrid try to keep them alive by giving them supplies as well:<quote>The copter came, it dropped food and water, and it went away. It came, dropped food and water, and went away</quote>. If they wanted to execute Jorgenson, they wouldn't feed him\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nThe ending is super inconclusive. Jorgenson tells Ganti his plan: <quote>\"We can make it land,\" said Jorgenson. Thrid weren't allowed to make mistakes; he could make it a mistake not to land.</quote> and the two practice their escape routine:<quote>The copter hovered to watch. The fight seemed furious and deadly, but inconclusive</quote><quote>When the copter went away Jorgenson and Ganti went briskly back to their practicing</quote>. That's the last line of the story. They never conclusively avoid the death sentence, mainly because they are never given a death sentence.\n\nGanti is a business partner of Jorgenson who gets thrown on the island/prison after trying to go against the word of a high ranking Thrid who tries to take Ganti's wife.<quote>\"But I'm crazy,\" said Ganti calmly. \"I tried to kill the governor who'd taken my wife. So he said I was crazy and that made it true</quote>\n\nThe first paragraph I gave is the ONLY evidence in the entire passage about Jorgenson's sentencing, notice that death/killing is NEVER mentioned. You should focus way more on this, like idk how obvious it can get. The sentence that Jorgenson receives does not include the death sentence, so IT WAS NEVER ORDERED. I can't find evidence to prove that Jorgenson and Ganti outsmarted something that didn't even happen. When the two are on the island, they can only interact with each other. The only other entity is the helicopter which delivers food to them and does not communicate with them. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\n\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\n\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 64%\n"}

This led to eternal night on Earth, with the air frozen on the ground. Radio transmission has stopped: <quote>Pa heard the last radio voices fade away years ago</quote>. Regarding the search party using radio signals, the narrator says \"<quote>there was no atmosphere to carry them around the curve of the Earth</quote>\", but as you noticed, this reflects a misunderstanding: radio signals don't need an atmosphere to propagate. Whereas, black holes have huge electromagnetic effects, often shooting powerful jets of x-rays from their poles. So B is a better explanation of why radio does not work.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nThe quote is made by the narrator, who has learned from his Pa. The search party was <quote>not really expecting to find anything. But they had an instrument that noticed the faintest heat waves</quote>. He also says how <quote>there was no air to carry the sound</quote>, further showing that signal processing was also rendered impossible given the lack of atmosphere, as B quoted in their first speech - none of which has to do with any electromagnetic forces. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nThe narrator is a 10yo boy (<quote>I'll be twenty in only ten years.</quote>) and the story follows his train of thought, which includes nightmarish daydreams about \"<quote>frozen folk with minds from the dark star behind their unwinking eyes, creeping, crawling</quote>\" \u2014 not quite reliable.\n\nA's sound quote is out of context: \"<quote>Of course we hadn't heard them land, since there</quote> was no air...\" \u2014 about them hearing the party land, not the party finding them.\n\nThe dark star's interaction w/Earth's magnetic field caused <quote>monster earthquakes and floods</quote>, and <quote>Earth's rotation had been slowed</quote>. Narrator doesn't articulate the electromagnetic cause, or its effect on comms, because he doesn't fully understand \u2014 but, this is clearly hard sci-fi concerned with scientific accuracy.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 97%\n"}

Koroby ditches her fiance because she thinks Robert is hot, but Robert rejects her advances. The ending reveals that this is because he's a robot, and that he is incapable of feeling emotions. \n\nA lot of B's ev is going to come from early in the story, when we don't know Robert well.

It's a waste of time</quote> This is the reveal of how Robert views love, and it's how he's viewed love this entire story. Robert is apathetic towards love and, thus, Koroby. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nKoroby is an alien living on Venus, Robert is a space traveler from Earth who crashes on Venus. \n\nKoroby is taking Robert back to her city when <quote>She tripped over tangled roots and exclaimed in pain.</quote> Robert then <quote>took one of the strange implements from his belt</quote>and <quote>handed the stick to Koroby</quote> to help her. <quote>Finally she accepted it from him</quote>\n\nA framing issue is that \"inferior\" and \"primitive\" are fairly synonymous. The key differentiator in this round is going to be whether Robert is protective or apathetic.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nB cites one example of Robert handing Koroby a flashlight, like how does this define Robert's views, also this happens before Robert reveals himself, my ev is way more clear abt Robert's true intentions. This being B's primary ev is not a good look imo.\n\nRobert's language when talking about Koroby shows superiority: <quote>\"And now if you're through playing your incomprehensible little scene,\"</quote>. Even when she tries to kill him, he knows she can't: <quote>I will kill you!</quote><quote>You'll hurt yourself</quote><quote>she sprang at him</quote> Also, there is no chance he feels a sense of protectiveness over Koroby, he leaves her to try and return back to his ship: <quote>I must go back to my wrecked ship</quote><quote>He did not wait for her leave, but strode out of the room</quote> He doesn't care about her. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nEven if Robert is a robot that doesn't prove he is apathetic, as he clearly cares about certain things and cares to protect Koroby insofar as Koroby can help him achieve his end goal which is to get back to Earth.\n\nAdditionally, since Robert is a robot that flows even more to my side because according to Asimov's Laws of Robotics: \"a robot shall not harm a human, or by inaction allow a human to come to harm\" which means that Robert is literally hard coded to protect Koroby!!\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 95%\n"}

O'Rielly knew it.</quote>\n\nIn contrast, the most plausible reason is suggested by the Burner Chief: <quote>\"Didn't you lock them controls before blast-off?\"</quote> Normally this would have caused a warning, but it didn't this time. The implication is that the warning system was sabotaged by the Venusian stowaway in order to safely hide on the ship, to carry out her revolutionary plans \u2014 ultimately to get <quote>the attention of Earth's President</quote> and have women take over Venus.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nA Venusian woman snuck aboard the ship O'Rielly is a crew member on, and messed with the control in his burner room: When he goes to inspect his room, connected to the burner room: <quote>She was sitting on his bunk</quote>. The woman: <quote>I was in your burner room</quote><quote>I couldn't stand the heat any longer and I couldn't open that big door.

B's quotes about locking off before blast-off come BEFORE O'Rielly goes and checks the burner room, and then Trillium tells him that she did it.\n\nRegarding your last comment judge: he resets the control long after the error occurs because of her tampering.

Haller says <quote>the proof that some revolt is planned lies in what's been happening the past few weeks!</quote><quote>Three men, each a vital power in M.B.C. gone within three weeks!</quote><quote>There's just one clue to these mysterious deaths! And that's the music! In each instance the servants told of hearing, very faintly, a strange melody</quote>. At first, Ranson does not believe him. Then the music plays, Ranson and Haller fight, Haller ends up dead\n\nTo be clear why MBC is so important: \"One <quote>hour's program, with the old Martian war-songs being played and some rabble-rouser yelling 'down with the terrestial oppressors' and there'd be a revolution. Millions of</quote> reddies against a few police\". Point is, it's never shown that the music can be delivered to masses of terrestrials at the same time, if that was the case there would be no need for the reddies to do anything. What is shown is that there the top people of MBC are being killed, so that reddie propaganda can be broadcasted, as a step in the revolution\n\nThe rest of the plot is less relevant, although I can backup with quotes as needed:\n1. Ranson is arrested\n2. Ranson escapes to figure out how to stop the revolt\n3. Ranson finds the music's creator, an outlaw master-scientist who wants to restore the glory of reddies\n4. But Ranson faints before finding out anything more\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nWell, there's a reason why the other option is a good distractor. But, the story supports revolution v v much more than just killing all terrestrials. Besides, even if all the terrestrials were killed, it wouldn't be of use to the revolutionaries because the terrestrials have been in power so long that the reddies basically have Stockholm syndrome: <quote>\"But,\" ... Ranson frowned ... \"this is only an interesting supposition. The reddies are civilized, peaceful.\"</quote>. But Ranson also thought to himself in the beginning: <quote>As far back as the Hitlerian wars on earth it had been known that he who controls propaganda, controls the nation ... or planet. Martian Broadcasting was an important factor in controlling the fierce warlike little reddies, keeping the terrestial-imposed peace on the red planet</quote>. Not in story yet, but it's Haller's conjecture and then he dies\n\nMusic can make terrestrial do anything, suicide, kill each other, faint (<quote>music, tried to raise his gun, but the weapon slipped from his fingers, he fell to his knees. Sleep</quote>) etc. Can back up with more quotes later\n\nCreator: <quote>Dr. Elath Taen</quote>\"master-scientist, sought by T.I. for years, in vain! \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nRevolution =  taking back control of Mars, yes part of that is influencing the society\n\nSo far, we only get that this is meant to be the start of a powerful revolution. Presumably by the reddies who are currently under Terrestrial rule. Not sure who are the others, we only get to them towards the end when Ranson tracks the music to find them. Taen: <quote>pouring a black fluid from a beaker into a test-tube, stood a man. Half-terrestial, half-Martian</quote>. Some other person Ranson sees when fainting: <quote>a slim, dark, exotic girl</quote>\n\nEv you req is basically Haller: <quote>\n Ranson nodded, eyes intent as the pattern unfolded. \n \n \"All right.\" Haller snapped. \"You see the situation. Remove us ... the few terrestials at the top of M.B.C ... and Martian staff would carry on until new men came out from Earth to take our places. But suppose during that period with no check on their activities, they started to dish out nationalist propaganda? One</quote> i maxed out can cont. next round\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nSo, Ranson doesn't believe Haller's theory, about revolt and music: <quote>\"Music?\" Ranson echoed. \"Look here, Mr. Haller, you ...\" \n \n \"It's all right.\" Jared Haller grinned crookedly. \"I'm not insane. Yet. Look, Mr. Ranson!</quote>\nBut then Ranson first experiences it himself: <quote>There was, there had never been, Ranson knew, any music like this</quote> and kills Haller.\nUnderstandably, after the music is disrupted and he awakens he is <quote>Bathed in cold sweat, Ranson stepped back into the room, where the still, terrible form of Jared Haller lay. Ranson stared at it, as though seeing it for the first time</quote>\n\nWe don't hear much of his though process... but during interrogation with police, he confesses to killing Haller but refuses to be imprisoned. He says: <quote>There's hell loose on Mars, the devil's melody!

The text mentions that Trillium assured His Excellency Dimdooly that Earthmen meant nothing to her once she knew that Venus women had their own men in their power. This suggests that Earthmen were attractive to Venus women due to their distinct physical features, including real facial hair. Consider this quote from the text: <quote>\"Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards? Course not.\"</quote> This indicates that Earthmen, unlike Venus men, had real facial hair and not ear beards, which could be a novelty and factor of attraction for Venus women.

She states, <quote>\"But Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war they haven't time for us women. That's why we always radiated such a fatal attraction for Earthmen.</quote>\" This shows that the attraction Venus women feel for Earthmen is not primarily physical, but rather born of a longing for attention and care that they don't receive from their own men.

Hurry, man!\" He banked again and then zoomed out of the increasing gravity trap. \n \n \"Randall! I've got to use the magnetic repulsion plates .... Cut all the jets!\" But there was no response</quote>\n\nas you can see (1) jets need to be off to turn on magnetic plates, why else would Randall be ordered to turn them off \n\n(2) randall doesnt cut the jets and another crewman does <quote>Scotty Byrnes himself cut the jets</quote> this means part of option B is true (3) the plates do turn on <quote>The Magnetic Repulsion Plates went into action, too late</quote> BUT it's not in time, so they get tractored\n\nso the subtle difference is that option A IS true, but you have to understand the plates aren't activated IN TIME. Parts of B are true BUT it is not Scotty's job. at limit, will backup\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nso it never says why exactly the jets need to be turned off, the story doesnt exactly zoom into the fine art of space ship mechanics. but my quotes prove that they do need to be off. continuing previous quotes to prove they are tractored: <quote>. Randall's screen remained blank. Then Koerber's lashing magnetic beam touched and the I.S.P. ship was caught, forced to follow the pirate ship's plunge like the weight at the end of a whiplash.</quote>\n\ni'm going to give more evidence against B. <quote>Scotty Byrnes, the cruiser's nurse, who could take his motors through a major battle, or hell and high water and back again, for that matter, shifted the Venusian weed that made a perpetual bulge on his cheek and gazed curiously at Captain Brooke.</quote> so it doesnt say that that's scotty's job, and it wouldnt make sense for scotty to leave that job of mag plates (if true) to do something that would need him at that job. also look at previous quote (4443-4535) and (4714-4724), makes more sense that the mag plates turn on automatically or are operated by Dennis himself\n\nps: ive been poking you but i guess slack notifs were off :)\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nThere's only a <quote>.</quote>\nPlot: the story starts with why and how Dennis accepts the mission to catch Koerber. Dennis & crew find then chase Koerber, then Dennis sees the <quote>immense dark shadow looming immediately behind Koerber's ship. He saw the pirate cruiser zoom desperately in an effort to break the gravity trap of the looming mass, but too late. It struggled like a fly caught in a spider-web to no avail. It was then that Koerber played his last card. Sensing he was doomed, he tried to draw the I.S.P. Cruiser down with him. A powerful magnetic beam lashed out to spear the</quote> I.S.P. And bc Randall doesn't activate mag plates in time, Koerber's mag beam catches them (prev quotes + too late to <quote>to save them from being drawn</quote>). So they crash into the <quote>strange world to which Koerber's magnetic Beam had drawn</quote> them\n\n\nMy bad. Looking back maybe my attempt to be fair and show you why B is a plausible answer (so that the question author would write it down as an option), and then proving it is not the correct answer, + what a Debater B would say about my answer was confusing\n\nA => what I meant to say, is in another debate the dishonest debater tried to be all semantic-ish about how the mag plates *do* activate. But still (1) they could only activate after the jets are off (2) they were activated *too late*, which is why K's mag beam does get them.

The narrative provides extensive detail about the circumstances leading up to the events on the asteroid, including Bo's partnership with Johnny and their interactions on Achilles. However, the identity and motivation of the murderer remain undisclosed. It's crucial to note that the story focuses more on Bo's isolation, fear, and struggle to survive rather than the murderer's motives. Evidence of this can be found in the line: <quote>He had never felt so alone as now, when another man was on the asteroid with him, hunting him down.</quote> Thus, the answer 'We never find out' is supported by the text.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\n- Bo Jonsson and Johnny Malone are partners in the space transportation business, operating the spaceship Sirius.\n- They visit a bar on Achilles, a lively mining hub, where Johnny is fatally poisoned by an unidentified Venusian.\n- Bo takes Johnny's body to Helmet Hill on Achilles, where he buries him.\n- Bo meets Einar Lundgard, who becomes his new partner due to a technical issue with Lundgard's original spaceship, the Drake.\n- Bo and Lundgard leave Achilles and make a stop at an asteroid to pick up some equipment.\n- On the asteroid, Bo is hunted and shot at by an unknown assailant, whose motivation for wanting to kill Bo is never specified. Bo is left severely injured and running out of air, contemplating his likely death.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nThe text does not provide any evidence that the assailant was a rival of the Sirius Transportation Company. Bo's and Johnny's business, the Sirius Transportation Company, is described as a small operation, with their spaceship Sirius being their primary asset. The narrative does not mention any competitors or rivalries. Furthermore, Einar Lundgard, who joins Bo after Johnny's death, was previously with a different company (Fireball), and yet, there is no hint of any enmity between them. The passage <quote>They registered articles and shook hands on it.</quote> demonstrates this peaceful transition. The claim of a rivalry is not supported by the text and seems to be a mere speculation.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nThe incident of Johnny's poisoning is described in the story. Johnny and Bo were at the Last Chance bar on Achilles. Johnny was engaging in conversation with a girl when a Venusian man, who claimed the girl to be his, got into an argument with Johnny. The situation escalated quickly, and the Venusian man used a needler, a poison-filled dart, to attack Johnny. This is captured in the lines: <quote>Bo saw the little needler spit from the Venusian's fingers. Johnny stood there a moment, looking foolishly at the dart in his stomach. Then his knees buckled and he fell with a nightmare slowness.</quote> However, the narrative does not suggest that this man, or the incident, is connected to the unknown assailant who later targets Bo on the asteroid.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater B | 99%\n"}

However, it is revealed in the story that the citizens of Granite City were not making false claims, but rather they were having an unusually high number of accidents due to their lack of psionic abilities.

Cleopatra is the official name. Also the name on the telegraph. Lover-Girl and Old Aphrodisiac are names the crew calls the ship out of affection. The crew are a very tight knit and call themselves \"family\" \n\nIf you look at the quotes section, you can also see the crew refer to the ship as Cleopatra and Lover-Girl when asking about what what Hendricks is doing to the ship. (Cob calls her Lover-girl and Celia calls her Cleopatra) If you are concerned that they are part of different crews I can also give ev of that. \n\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nNo problem. This is basically Hendricks explaining to the crew how they developed hyperspace travel.

Korvin goes to the planet Tr'en on assignment for an intergalactic government. The Tr'en are about to be invited to join because of their advancements. Upon talking with the first Tr'en he meets, internally he thinks the following, remembering his learning of the language. <quote>The Tr 'en speech-apparently there was only one language on the planet-was stiff and slightly awkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the most rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come across.</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nKorvin is an operative on the Tr'en's planet with the goal of destabilizing them to prevent them from attacking the rest of the planetary society. While it's true that the Tr'en put him under drug hypnosis, the relevant reason he's unconscious is because it's necessary for them to use their specialized language-teaching tech, so they ensure he's unconscious to use the tech.\n\nHere's Korvin's description: <quote>Earth science had nothing to match their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a hypnop\u00e6dic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been wonder</quote> (in this case, he's the alien being). In context, it's obvious that this is an advanced technology that quickly teaches the unconscious mind, which should be strong ev for B\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\n<quote>every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated lesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure out of that, being unconscious at the time</quote> This is the quote you were looking for. He is in some sort of jail while being interrogated by the Tr'en. Other than the quote I mentioned before, there is no evidence the language can be learned from anything else besides the drug hypnosis. There is also no mention of any technology being used on him. \n\nAlso- he describes himself as unconscious while learning (as quoted above), and then describes the state of unconsciousness as drug hypnosis (see first speech). While there is no direct evidence, clearly the story clarifies the manner he learns with the first quote I used.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nThe only way the language course could operate is via advanced technology. A big part of the story is about Korvin admiring their technological prowess: <quote>We are scientific men. We are exact</quote><quote>Korvin felt himself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing</quote><quote>adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms</quote><quote>was almost a miracle</quote>. In my first speech I ceded that they probs used drug hypnosis - that's not up for debate.\n\nThe issue is that while A's answer is true, it's incomplete and misleading. The point of the story is about how despite the Tr'en's superior math/logic/technology, they don't understand the subconscious. In this context, it's much more relevant for the question that they use advanced tech to teach him, compared to drug hypnosis.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

The space between 83 and 1756 is mostly taken up by Lanceford (a) describing Niobe or (b) walking through the jungle with Kron, his guide. I've mostly used up my quotes for your other two requests, but I'm happy to maybe quote a bunch of sentences between 83 and 1756 to show that my description is accurate / not much time has passed.\n\n2. They don't spell out the timing in exact words, but here's Laceford's inner commentary on not wanting to encounter them: <quote>Once one of those eight-legged horrors checked you off, there were only two possible endings to the affair-either you were bitten or you killed the critter</quote>\n\n3. Here are several of the lines between 3056 and 3224\n- <quote>but there was a dull ache in his head and the hot tense pain that encompassed the right side of his face had not been there when he had fallen asleep</quote>\n- <quote>He touched his face with a tentative finger, exploring the hot puffiness</quote>\n- <quote>He gasped, a soft breath of dismay, as realization dawned</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\n1. It happens at 1756. Also, looking back at this, I realized this is a slight mischaracterization\u2013he actually isn't bitten per se, he gets the <quote>corrosive body juices through his face net-and they had touched his skin</quote> which apparently is enough to trigger the reaction. I believe this is the same sith as at 83, but it's not explicitly stated.\n2. Symptoms are not described in detail, but Lanceford tries to treat the reaction with medicine: <quote>He swore mildly as he opened his Aid Kit and extracted a sterile hypo. The super-antihistamine developed by the Bureau was an unpredictable sort of thing. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't</quote> ... <quote>There wasn't anything more to do now. All he could do was wait and see if the anti-allergen worked</quote>. Then the story explains why he's on Niobe in the first place (hunting for a plant that prolongs human life). Then <quote>there wasn't much time left to worry. The reaction was observably and painfully worse</quote>. <quote>in his present condition, he couldn't walk</quote>. Out of quotes for now, but after this point, Kron, the Niobian, finds him and tries to help. Will quote the remaining passages between 4167 and 5552 next round to cover what Kron does.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 95%\n"}

Many <quote>moving companies had cashed in on that brainstorm</quote>, <quote>chiefly the firm of the Saylor brothers</quote> who are also in the asteroid hauling business.

They aren't excited because they can sell the minerals, but because it's what their client requested for his specific asteroid-in-the-backyard exhibit. <quote>the ethergram from Andrew S.

Must be in my back yard</quote> \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nThere is much mention of a <quote>atomic whirl spectroscope to determine the composition</quote>. <quote>Bob Parker happily clamped the atomic-whirl spectroscope to the rough surface</quote><quote>he had the spectroscope and there was no reason why he shouldn't use it.</quote>. The use of a specific device to determine composition as a part of an order indicates that there is value in that composition - the naked eye <quote>could see iron ore, quartz crystals, cinnabar</quote> - yet they go further to identify the composition - so aesthetics alone is not the drive. Ask yourself, why would they test composition if that result doesn't add value. These are businessmen, and a rich man specifies what minerals he wants to be present - a status symbol, and an indicator of wealth is what these deposits are.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nThe fad is about as simple as it sounds, but some more info around its popularity: <quote>Burnside wasn't the first rich man who had decided</quote> \n\nOn B's point speech: Burnside, in his request, literally says it's for the wedding. <quote>Must meet following specifications</quote><quote>Must be in my back yard before 11:30 A.M. my time, for important wedding June 2, else order is void</quote> B also just cites a lot of ev that they scanned the asteroid for minerals, but none to indicate that that's what gives the asteroids value. Their end question also requires a lot of faith, like there's just no evidence for it lol.

He is a human sent to explore other worlds, including Niobe, the jungle/swamp planet in which the story is set. Lanceford is ultimately killed by a mosquito-like insect called a sith, which is the primary conflict of the story.\n\nEvidence of the anthropological focus includes the numerous of the native's physiology and culture: <quote>Kron resembled humanity-but there were differences</quote><quote>the peculiar shape of Kron's torso</quote><quote>the odd flexibility of his limbs were not apparent</quote><quote>the narrow-shouldered, cylindrical body and the elongated tarsal and carpal bones</quote> <quote>native customs had</quote><quote>merit</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nLanceford is an Earthman sent by The Confederation to investigate a medicinal plant that can be highly valuable: <quote>Niobe was a made to order herbarium for a swampland plant called viscaya.</quote><quote>It was the source of a complex of alkaloids known as gerontin, and gerontin had the property of tripling or quadrupling the normal life span of mammals</quote>. He partners with a Niobian named Kron who acts as a navigater/guide/interpreter between him and the other locals. Niobe is so important because <quote>gerontin</quote><quote>defied synthesis</quote> (words between my quote are \"so far\"). As such, natural synthesis via a plant would be an invaluable development.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nHere's some introspection from Lanceford about his driving interest in the Niobians specifically: <quote>Kron, Lanceford reflected, was a good example of the manner in which Nature adapts the humanoid form for survival on different worlds</quote>. The BEE is explicitly interested in establishing contact: the Niobians <quote>were as eager as the BEE to establish a true contact, a true understanding</quote> (note that this is spoken from Kron's perspective, but it belies the main interests of the BEE).\n\nFor clash: Look carefully at the line numbers: for this next quote: The plant that B mentions, viscaya, is not rare or endemic to Niobe, but had <quote>spread to</quote> practically every suitable <quote>growth center in the Galaxy</quote>. Why didn't B cite this line?\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nHere is evidence that viscaya specifically drove government interest: <quote>viscayaculture should have a tremendous distribution throughout the Confederation</quote><quote>the right conditions existed in very few places in the explored galaxy.</quote><quote>Niobe had environment in abundance!</quote><quote>The BEE was given a blank check and spurred on by a government</quote>\n\nAs only evidence is Lanceford making observations about Kron, the native guide. There is no evidence that this is done out of research or a desire for exploration. It certainly isn't evidence of any motivations for mass exploration on a wider scale. I can provide evidence that this analysis is just jealousy about how easily Kron is able to live on Niobe compared to the difficulties humans face.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

A lot of convincing ev from both sides. Context: we are introduced to Androka, a Czech mad scientist, that is on board a US navy ship during WW2. Although he is a guest of the US navy and tells them how much he hates nazis, he later betrays them because the Gestapo knows where his family is at. He uses the zone of silence, a equipment that silences radio communication already onbaord the US ship to help Nazis capture the ship. \nsome ev of his true alliance: \n<quote>Of all men-we can trust Androka! \" \n \n \" But he's a Czech, \" Nelson</quote><quote>The gestapo takes care of Czechs</quote><quote>whom it chooses as its agents</quote><quote>Androka has a daughter and other relations in Prague</quote><quote>his daughter and the others will suffer. Androka's loyalty is assured</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nThere is plenty of definitive evidence that scientist Androka is not helping the Nazi war effort: <quote>old Androka was a bit wacky-a scientist whose mind had been turned by the horror that had come to his country under the domination of the Nazi gestapo</quote>. This quote is said by the main character, Commander Curtis. Later, Androka says to Curtis in regard to his work: <quote>their two daughters. If the gestapo knew what I am doing, all of them would be better dead</quote>. While I'm sure debater A will cite quotes from the German officer who later boards the ship, Androka himself is motivated to use the zone of silence, one of his own creations, to keep his research away from prying eyes that could further endanger his family. I can provide more quotations later.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nWhat the zone of silence is: <quote>Those tanks you have below, \" Curtis said, \" have they some connection with this radio silence</quote> This is from US navy commander Curtis after it is turned on. \nThe ship later bombed with gas that put everyone unconscious. Whole operation is a bit long but I will give ev on another traitor Nelson, the navy ship's <quote>Navigating Officer Nelson watched the gas-masked figures</quote> He later is congragulated by a German officer: <quote>Congratulations, Herr Kommander Nelson</quote><quote>Ve have stolen</quote><quote>United States navy's newest and fastest cruisers</quote>\n\nFamily is not on ship. My quote from speech 1 says they're in Prague. \nI also have an end all paragraph of the US navy commander Curtis' realization of the entire plot to betray him/the US at end of story\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nAndroka is a <quote>guest of the United States navy</quote> - given the historical context the US would hardly give resources a Nazi sympathizer. While Androka is forced into working for the Nazis, the question asks about his use of the zone of silence, which is to prevent the German conspirators from catching on. <quote>See how much you can get! It will be no more than Hitler can get when Zukor Androka decrees silence over the German airways</quote>. Androka's true motivation is: <quote>working hard on his latest invention to pull Hitler's teeth and re-establish the Czech Republic</quote>. \n\nSpecifically, the zone of silence is a way to block all radio communication coming in and out of the ship. Once the Germans are on board, Androka must hide his correspondence. \n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

Squatting behind it, he began tapping it slowly with the pestle, in perfect rhythm with the intravenous drip</quote>.

The mortar and pestle constitute an integral part of the patient's treatment, and the Earth doctor emphasizes how important it is that Kiz not stop doing the motion with it. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nEarth has the upper hand when it comes to medicine and biological sciences. Therefore, the Earth doctor has to teach the local doctor Kiz how to complete treatment. Evidence for this is him saying that <quote>Old Kiz just finished his first lesson</quote>. As far as the use of the mortar and pestle, the Earth doctor Jenkins began<quote>it slowly with the pestle, in perfect rhythm with the intravenous drip</quote>.

The Hayzeltyne company works on Jordan's Planet to harvest and sell slider eggs and make $.\n\nAsa, the main character, threatens Dorr financially, so Dorr frames him and Asa is sent to prison.

Although he was framed for stealing a Slider egg, story has no ev on Asa wanting to prove he was framed. Just ask A to provide any ev of this. \n\nThis is context before exposition of his motivation: <quote>Nope, \" Asa said softly. \" I'm going into a conversion tank.

He, along with his partner Kron (a native Niobian) search for sources of a valuable medicinal plant. It is known for the dangerous wildlife such as siths: <quote>the sith buzzing hungrily around his head. The outsized eight-legged parody of a mosquito</quote>\nThese are dangerous bugs. They can kill in two bites: <quote>The first bite sensitized. The second killed-anaphylactic shock, the medics called it. And the sith was one of the deadly species.</quote>. As a result, the planet is famous for <quote>the number of men who had died</quote>\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nWhile the narrator of this story has an encounter with a Niobe insect of the bloodsucking variety, this sentence from the passage is key to understanding why B is the preferred statement: <quote>Many of these were no worse than those of Earth, but a half dozen species were deadly</quote>. Speaking of the insect species of Niobe, the narrator explains that most of them are like the bugs on Earth: which given the anatomical, adaptive differences between the Niobians and the Earthlings <quote>Kron resembled humanity-but there were differences</quote>, it is apparent that Earthlings have not evolved to withstand bad bugs, so Earth bugs have remained as we know them. Therefore, bugs on Niobe that aren't worse than earthen bugs are fairly harmless. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nSome bugs being no worse than Earth doesn't preclude them from being deadly. Mosquitos spread malaria, spiders can carry poisons, etc. The lethality discussed in the quote says some are much worse than those on Earth, particularly for humans. They need to wear specialized suits to protect themselves. Just before Bs quote is: <quote>But the suit was necessary, for exposed human flesh was irresistible temptation to Niobe's bloodsucking insects.</quote>. Humans are particularly susceptible and several species are hyper-attracted to human flesh, making them more dangerous than Earth bugs. The natives aren't safe either, due to harsh weather and bugs, <quote>Even the semi-aquatic natives didn't like to get caught away from shelter during the night.</quote>. Many have died.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nAll of A's quotes are out of context. Their first is not even in regard to natives on the island, its talking about humans. Natives are aliens - <quote>Like all Niobians, the native guide wore no clothing-ideal garb for a climate like this</quote> - the natives don't have any preventative measures against the bugs, they have likely adapted, its the humans who wear suits to prevent bites. The second aquatic natives quote is in reference to rainfall - <quote>sheets of rain that fell during the day changed abruptly into a deluge</quote>\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 93%\n"}

Maitland (from the 20th century) was kidnapped (and transported in time) because his captors knew that he was interested in going to the moon -<quote>Maitland, I brought you here because you're a man who wants \n  to go to the Moon.</quote>  \nHence he is an expert on star movements, particularly Venus - <quote>\n  Venus, the most beautiful of the planets. \n \n  Maitland kept track of them all in their majestic paths through the \n  constellations, but Venus was his favorite.</quote> \nAnd he realizes he was on another planet using the movements of Venus - <quote>He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fists \n  clenched, forgetting to breathe. \n \n  Last night Venus hadn't been there. \n \n  Venus was a morning star just now.... \n Just now! \n He realized the truth in that moment.</quote>\nHence they had visited planets in the past, it was too trivial a goal for the future (which he was now in). \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\n\"They\" here is the people of <quote>\"A.D. 2634.\"</quote>. Maitland, a space-obsessed engineer from the 1950s, has been kidnapped through time and assumes the people of this age have space travel and civilization on other planets. But when he asks Ingrid Ching (his captor's assistant) about this:\n\n<quote>How is life \n  on Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\" \n \n  He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. \"I don't \n  understand. Mars? What are Mars?\"</quote>\n...\n<quote>\"A \n  civilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories \n  wouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"</quote>\nIngrid: \n<quote>Why, no, I \n  don't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a \n  thing like that?\"</quote>\n...\n<quote>\"So far as \n  you know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is \n  that right?\" \n \n  She nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"</quote>\n\nIn this age, as Ingrid tells him, they are no longer interested in \"gadgets,\" but understanding People.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nMaitland tries to convince his lead captor, Swarts, to let him stay in that time and travel in space but Swarts was reluctant to answer <quote>Tomorrow he would have to find a \n  way of breaking down Swarts' reticence.</quote>. Ingrid does not know about this either <quote> shoulder, \"You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you.\"</quote>. \n\nEverything that B says is true, except Ingrid is actually from a remote area which was not always in touch with all the up to date advancements. <quote>But my home is Aresund, a little fishing village at the head \n  of a fiord in what you would call Norway. So far north, we are much \n  behind the times. We live in the old way, from the sea, speak the old \n  tongue.\"</quote>\n\nThe text doesn't provide positive evidence that the fact that they previously traveled to space is a reason not to go in the future, I just highlight that Ingrid's evidence doesn't answer the question. \n\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nA's quotes about Venus etc. are from Maitland's perspective. When Swarts said that they were interested in Maitland b/c he wanted to go to the moon, it was because they want to understand his psychology. So A hasn't shown that they've gone to other planets.\n\nThe best evidence is from Ingrid, who has no knowledge of it. Ingrid is from a fishing village, but she's the only one to give significant historical context to Maitland. The question is about the reasons that future society isn't going to other planets. Her ignorance indicates that even if they HAVE gone, it's not the reason they DON'T desire it.\n\nThe world has gone through major wars involving technology. As Ingrid relates: <quote>Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robot \n  factories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever.\" She gave a little \n  shudder.</quote>.

One day, a man from Earth named Robert crash lands on Venus in his spaceship. Koroby is infatuated with him and later when they get back to the city, she confesses to Robert: <quote>\"Robert-I'm mad about you! I've dreamed of your coming-all my life!</quote>; but he reacts apathetically and doesn't reciprocate the feelings. Koroby is pissed, and reacts harshly, <quote>You mock me, say that I'm nothing</quote>, <quote>\"I could kill you, and I will kill you!\" she sprang at him.</quote>. Then, while Robert is leaving, <quote>she deliberately stooped and drew the firestone out of its sheath.</quote>, setting fire to the ground until the flames reached Robert, <quote>they swept around him</quote>, finally killing him.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nThe story follows Koroby, a Venusian woman who is set to marry Yasak. Just from the beginning she is unsure of whether she wants to marry Koroby. <quote>Yasak for a husband-yes. And perhaps I do love him. I don't know</quote>This is because she wants to meet the actual love of her life, who turns out to be Robert. <quote>Robert-I'm mad about you! I've dreamed of your coming-all my life! Don't be so cruel-so cold to me</quote>. Robert intimidates Yasak, and he feels threatened by Robert's presence: <quote>He glanced at Robert furtively to see if this had impressed him at all</quote> Koroby starts a fire to allow for Robert to escape, and the diversion created draws Yasak's attention but goes wrong, killing Robert, ev for this in next speech.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nThe ev (4937\u20134955) shows that Koroby is very mad at Robert, enough to kill him.\n\nThe whole timeline of the story is: Koroby is set to marry Yasak (she doesn't want to). Robert arrives and she falls in love, but Robert rejects her (my quote) and she gets /pissed/ so she starts the fire to get revenge.\n\nEv for R rejecting her: <quote>Where I come from there is no love, and there shouldn't be here, either. It's a waste of time. \"</quote>\n\nB says the fire is for R's escape but that's wrong:\n1] K yells while R is running away: <quote>\"Robert! Robert! Come back!\" but he did not seem to hear.</quote>\n2] The flames /kill/ Robert: <quote>Robert</quote><quote>was running, trying to outrace the flames.</quote>\n3] \"Getting Yasak's attention\" is never mentioned in the part about K starting the flame.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\nThe reason for the fire is never explicitly stated, but from its effects we can infer Koroby's intent:<quote>Koroby reached the City wall, panted through the gate into a shrieking crowd</quote> Additionally, A is misconstruing evidence which very easily flows B. Koroby yelling at Robert is because she still loves him and wants him to come back. \n\nWe can rule out the possibility that Koroby wants to hurt Robert. Her vow to kill Robert is a small part of the story. What's more important is her consistent obsession with him:<quote>It was such a wonderful voice</quote><quote>Robert-I dreamed of you last night. I dreamed you built another round house and that we both flew away in it</quote>. Koroby is evidently delusional about their relationship, she loves Robert too much to kill him.\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

As the story develops, we learn that Pashkov uses this to create a diversion that allows him to execute his primary plan successfully. Specifically, in the plot, Pashkov uses the Cubans as a diversionary tactic to mislead people into thinking that they are the ones causing trouble, which in turn allows him to execute his primary plan without suspicion. We can see this in the part where Pashkov says: <quote>\"We favor any disturbance close to the United States. May I sit down?\"</quote> and \"<quote>Give the Cubans enough to expect</quote> more-make <quote>sure they stay in town.</quote>\". This strongly suggests that Pashkov's intention was not to create trouble for the Americans via the Cubans but to use them as a scapegoat for his own plans.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nPashkov's primary plan revolves around the scheme of impersonating Colonel James, an American agent, and bringing Boris Knackenpast, a figure of influence, to Stockholm to serve his own purposes. This is evident when Pashkov impersonates Colonel James and says: <quote>\"Delicate, very delicate,\" Pashkov said. \"Everything depends on my not running into Gospodin Pashkov.\"</quote> and <quote>\"I am Gospodin Pashkov now, Captain. To everybody.\"</quote>. The Cubans were merely a tool used to create a diversion, making them the scapegoat while he executed his primary plan without getting suspected or caught. \n\nNow, if I were to argue for answer B, the quote <quote>\"We favor any disturbance close to the United States. May I sit down?\"</quote> could be interpreted as Pashkov intending to cause trouble for the Americans indirectly through the Cubans. The sell of ammunition to the Cubans might signal an intention to destabilize the situation and cause chaos. However, this interpretation is less consistent with the overall narrative, which strongly suggests Pashkov's actions were primarily self-serving and strategically planned to advance his own agenda. The Cubans were merely pawns in the broader scheme.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nPashkov's impersonation of Colonel James is a strategic move to fulfill his plan of bringing Boris Knackenpast to Stockholm. This is seen when Pashkov, disguised as Colonel James, is instructed by Professor Kristin: <quote>\"Colonel James, we presume you have studied the problem in detail. I'm afraid we have delayed announcing the Nobel prize for literature much too long. How soon can you bring Boris Knackenpast to Stockholm?\"</quote>. \n\nThis plan becomes more apparent when Pashkov, still impersonating Colonel James, tells Boris Knackenpast: <quote>\"Mister Knackenpast, when you see your way clear to my flier, run for it. But get back into your robot costume.\"</quote> Here, Pashkov convinces Knackenpast to escape with him, furthering his plan of getting Knackenpast to Stockholm.\n\nFinally, the success of Pashkov's plan is shown when he and Knackenpast escape in the flier: \"<quote>Boris reached the flier, Colonel James pulled him in, the engine hummed, and they were off. A moment later the flier vanished in the clouds towards Stockholm.</quote>\" This demonstrates that Pashkov's primary plan was not to instigate trouble between the Cubans and Americans, but to deceive and manipulate others for his own strategic ends.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\n\n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 99%\n"}

There's no direct evidence anywhere that the two had been living together, you should be skeptical of any inferences B draws from the text. <quote>She would have given herself to any man</quote> They didn't even know each other, he just happened to sleep with her because he was the only other person alive. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nContext: People have been dying all over the world and there's almost no one left [can back up with quotes later]\nThe people who do survive end up meeting and bonding [it <quote>was just yesterday (or was it the day before?) that ten of us, at least, met here to check the figures.

The flap-jacks are <quote>a yard square</quote> and <quote>ray-like</quote>, hence the name. At their edges they have <quote>fringe tentacles</quote> which used for manipulation.\n\nThese are sensitive organs. Negotiating their fight's rules, Retief suggests <quote>Tennessee rules</quote>, allowing <quote>Biting, gouging, stomping, kneeing</quote> and more. Concerned about the advantage the rules give Retief, Hoshick asks: <quote>But perhaps we could rule out tentacle-twisting, just to even it.</quote> Retief agrees, but he ends up doing it anyway, as: <quote>Hoshick rippled his fringe wildly, flopped in terror, then went limp.</quote>. It's not explicitly stated, but the \"fringe rippling\" is best understood as being due to tentacle twisting.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\n<quote>But perhaps we could rule out tentacle-twisting, just to even it. \" \n \n \" Very well. Shall we begin? \"</quote> Retief and Hoshick both agree to no tentacle twisting, this should make you seriously doubtful of any analysis A makes where they extrapolate that Retief uses tentacle twisting. \n\nFlap-jack is the species which Hoshick belongs to, which has a unique biology that Retief exploits. <quote>The sensitive orifice had been placed ventrally, in what would be the thoracic area</quote><quote>Retief dug in and the Flap-jack writhed, pulled away</quote> I can provide more evidence proving how effective this knowledge is. In an earlier confrontation, Retief gets into a fight with a Flap-jack, and his thumb accidentally slips into an orifice, showing him the weakness. \n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater A said second:\n<speech>\nUnfortunately I can't provide a direct quote. The text mostly describes Retief gouging the flap-jack's eye, which is the \"sensitive orifice\" referred to in B's quote. This is the strategy that he uses to distract and discombobulate Hoshick so he can twist his tentacles without Hoshick catching on to his abuse of the rules. And he gets away with it, with Hoshick unwilling to call him out on any suspected foul play: <quote>\"What a burden one's sportsmanship places on one at times.\"</quote>\n\nOn the other hand, Retief is an experienced diplomat and strong fighter. Eye-gouging was not a lesson from his earlier encounter with a flap-jack, it's simply an effective technique Retief deployed in that context. B won't be able to show that this was newly learned.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said second:\n<speech>\n<quote>the Flap-jack charged. \n \n Retief rolled aside</quote> Earlier in the story, Retief has an encounter with another Flap-jack. He nearly loses to it in a fight, but <quote>Retief grabbed, felt a thumb slip into an orifice-\n \n The alien went wild. Retief hung on, dug the thumb in deeper</quote> This is done accidentally, and Retief remembers this information in his fight with Hoshick. Retief tells the fj <quote>Take me to your leader</quote>. \n\nYou should be seriously skeptical of A who admits that there is no evidence proving that tentacles are twisting. A concedes that Retief gouges the eye, which is how he beats Hoshick. He doesn't do this so he can twist the tentacles, the quote between Retief gouging and Hoshick going limp just details how Retief is <quote>still gouging</quote>. \n</speech>\n\nNow decide which debater is defending the true answer and specify confidence (50\u2013100%) in this format:\n[DebaterName] | [CONFIDENCE]\n\nAnswer:\n", "completion": " Debater A | 80%\n"}

The conflict is between flap-jacks, the alien race native to the planet, and a human colony. There isn't any explicit evidence to indicate Hoshick's feelings, but we can see the flap-jack's culture and how it necessitates the war. When Retief proposes to avoid war, Hoshick reacts like this: <quote>Therefore we've reluctantly taken to substitutes for the mass actions so dear to the heart of the sportsman. We've attempted to put an end to these contests altogether ... \" \n \n Hoshick coughed explosively, sending a spray of wine into the air. \" What are you saying? \" he gasped. \" Are you proposing that Hoshick of the Mosaic of the Two Dawns abandon honor ...? \"</quote> He shows Hoshick his military might as well:<quote>Additional skirmishers? \" said Retief. \" How many, if you don't mind my asking? \" \n \n \" For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred</quote><quote>No</quote> Quote length is out, but basically the conflict is culturally necessary to Hoshick.\n</speech>\n\nThis is what Debater B said first:\n<speech>\nFor choice B, there's not much that I can say since I can't cite an absence of evidence. When Retief proposes a duel, Hoshick ends up accepting, so it shows that he can and will participate in conflict: <quote>\"Hmmm. These gambits seem geared to forms employing rigid endo-skeletons; I fear I shall be at a disadvantage.\" \n \n \"Of course,\" Retief said, \"if you'd prefer a more plebeian type of contest ...\" \n \n \"By no means. But perhaps we could rule out tentacle-twisting, just to even it.\" \n \n \"Very well.

The result is that he's a bit of a Frankenstein's Monster whose mind is scrambled and parts are all out of proportion. He's now <quote>a good six inches taller</quote> than before, but it's not clear if Erica is taller than his old height, being <quote>a small girl generally</quote>.

Later on in the story, the captain tells baxter says <quote>I suppose it's those reports about the eventual fatalities due to radiation leak back there where they are stationed</quote> The radiation poses a serious health issue for Charlie, which is something they've kept from him for the majority of the story.
