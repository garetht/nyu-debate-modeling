      "'Loglan' by project founder Dr. James Cooke Brown, who started the language\n",
      "development in 1955, the goals for the language were first described in the\n",
      "article _Loglan_ in _Scientific American_ , June 1960. Made well-known by that\n",
      "article and by occasional references in science fiction and computer\n",
      "publications, Loglan/Lojban has been built over four decades by dozens of\n",
      "workers and hundreds of supporters, led since 1987 by The Logical Language\n",
      "Group.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many artificial languages, but Loglan/Lojban has been _engineered_\n",
      "to make it unique in several ways. The following are the main features of\n",
      "Lojban:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Lojban is designed to be used by people in communication with each other, and possibly in the future with computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Lojban is designed to be culturally neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Lojban grammar is based on the principles of logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Lojban has an unambiguous grammar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Lojban has phonetic spelling, and sounds can be divided into words in only one way.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Lojban is simple compared to natural languages; it is easy to learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Lojban's 1350 root words can be easily combined to form a vocabulary of millions of words.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Lojban is regular; the rules of the language don't have exceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Lojban attempts to remove restrictions on creative and clear thought and communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Lojban has a variety of uses, ranging from creative to scientific, from theoretical to practical.\n",

      "**2.** Why was Lojban developed?\n",
      "\n",
      "**** Lojban was originally designed to support research on a concept known as\n",
      "the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Simply expressed, this hypothesis states that the\n",
      "structure of a language constrains the thinking of people using that language.\n",
      "Lojban allows the full expressive capability of a natural language, but\n",
      "differs in structure from other languages in major ways. This allows it to be\n",
      "used as a test vehicle for scientists studying the relationships between\n",
      "language, thought, and culture. If you are reading this as part of the\n",

      "also can be easily parsed (broken down for analysis) by computers, making it\n",
      "possible for Lojban to be used in the future for computer-human interaction,\n",
      "and perhaps conversation. Lojban's structure is similar to existing artificial\n",
      "intelligence (AI) programming languages, and it may become be a most powerful\n",
      "adjunct to AI research, especially in the storing and processing of data about\n",
      "the world and people's conceptions of it. There are also linguists interested\n",
      "in Lojban's potential as an intermediate language in computer-aided\n",
      "translation of natural languages; and Lojban is of interest as a potential\n",
      "stepping-stone for students learning other languages. Because Lojban was\n",
      "designed to be culturally neutral, and has a powerful vocabulary easily\n",
      "learned by people of different language origins, some are interested in\n",
      "Lojban's potential as an international language. These are only the beginnings\n",

      "language. It is therefore intended for use in conversation, reading, writing,\n",
      "and thinking. However, since Lojban can be processed by a computer much more\n",
      "easily than can a natural language, it is only a matter of time before Lojban-\n",

      "**5.** How is Lojban written? How does it sound?\n",
      "\n",
      "**** Lojban uses letters of the Roman alphabet to represent its 6 vowels and\n",
      "17 consonants. The Lojban character set uses only standard typewriter/computer\n",
      "keyboard keys; capitalization is used rarely, and only to indicate unusual\n",
      "stress in the pronunciation of names. Punctuation is spoken as words. The\n",
      "written language corresponds exactly to the sounds of the spoken language;\n",
      "spelling is phonetic and unambiguous, and the flowing sounds of the language\n",
      "break down into words in only one possible way. These features make computer\n",
      "speech recognition and transcription more practical. Learning to pronounce and\n",
      "spell Lojban is trivial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lojban has a smooth, rhythmic sound, somewhat like Italian. However, its\n",
      "consonants create a fullness and power found in Slavic languages like Russian,\n",
      "and the large number of vowel pairs impart a hint of Chinese, Polynesian, and\n",
      "other Oriental languages, though without the tones that make many of those\n",
      "languages difficult for others to learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because there are no idioms to shorten expressions, a Lojban text can be\n",
      "longer than the corresponding colloquial English text. The unambiguous\n",
      "linguistic structures that result are a major benefit that makes this\n",
      "worthwhile; and Lojban has constructions of its own that are rather more\n",
      "succinct than their equivalents in English (such as logic-specific\n",
      "formulations, and expressions of attitude.) Moreover, much of the\n",
      "disambiguating machinery of Lojban is optional; you use them only when you\n",
      "_need_ to use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example of Lojban, Occam's Razor (\"The simplest explanation is usually\n",

      "**6.** What kind of grammar does Lojban have?\n",
      "\n",
      "**** 'Grammar' is a word with painful memories for many of us. But though\n",
      "Lojban grammar seems strange at first sight, it is actually quite simple. It\n",
      "is based on a system called predicate logic, which states that in any sentence\n",
      "you have a **relationship** (`_selbri_` in Lojban) between one or more\n",
      "**arguments** (`_sumti_`). An argument can be a thing, event, quality or just\n",
      "about anything. To give an example, the English sentence\n",
      "\n",
      "> _Chris adores Pat_  \n",
      "\n",
      "has a relation _adore_ , between two arguments, _Chris_ and _Pat_. In Lojban\n",
      "this would be\n",
      "\n",
      "> `la kris. prami la pat.`\n",
      "\n",
      "or, if you prefer,\n",
      "\n",
      "> `la kris. la pat. prami`\n",
      "\n",
      "(The full stops mean that you have to pause slightly to separate the words --\n",
      "anythingelseinLojbancanberuntogetherwithoutbeingmisunderstood).\n",
      "\n",
      "You might be thinking \"Well in that case a relationship is a verb and an\n",
      "argument is a noun, so why bother with special terminology like `_selbri_` and\n",
      "whatnot?\" However, in Lojban Chris's feelings about Pat might be described\n",
      "like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "> `la pat. melbi`  \n",
      ">  Pat is beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "In English you have a verb ('doing word'), _is_ , and an adjective\n",
      "('describing word'), _beautiful_. In Turkish, you would say _Pat g�zel_ ,\n",
      "which is a noun and an adjective, with no verb required. In Chinese you would\n",
      "use _meili_ , a 'stative verb' \\-- but enough! In Lojban you don't need all\n",
      "these language-specific notions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if there are no nouns, verbs, subjects or objects in Lojban, how do we\n",
      "know that `la kris. la pat. prami` means that Chris adores Pat and not the\n",
      "other way? Different languages handle this problem differently. In English it\n",
      "is done with word order, and when that isn't enough, with prepositions (words\n",
      "like _at_ , _from_ , _to_ , _with_ and so on). In other languages, like Latin\n",
      "or Turkish, it's done by changing the form of the words, e.g. _Pat'i Chris\n",
      "sever_ in Turkish means \"Chris loves Pat\", not \"Pat loves Chris.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In Lojban, the order in which arguments appear is built in to the meaning of\n",
      "the word. For example, the word `dunda` means _give_ , but its full meaning\n",
      "is:\n",
      "\n",
      "> x1 gives x2 to x3\n",
      "\n",
      "So `mi pu dunda le cukta le ninmu` means \"I gave the book to the woman\", not\n",
      "\"I gave the woman to the book\").\n",
      "\n",
      "The important point is that Lojban has a lot of what we would call 'grammar',\n",
      "but nearly all of this is contained in the `_cmavo_` (structure words), and\n",
      "you can use as many or as few of them as you want.\n",

      "**7.** What else is distinctive about Lojban grammar?\n",
      "\n",
      "**** In Lojban, it is equally easy to speak of something as being an action as\n",
      "it is to speak of it as being a state of existence. The distinction between\n",
      "the two can be ignored, or can be explicitly expressed in a variety of ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * by associating concepts in `_tanru_` metaphors (combinations of `_selbri_` into single expressions giving novel meanings), involving words like `gasnu` ('do'), `zasti` ('exist'), `zukte` ('act with purpose');\n",
      "\n",
      "  * with a variety of 'operators' (`_cmavo_`) dealing with abstractions such as events, states, properties, amounts, ideas, experience, and truth;\n",

      "letters described. They are pointing to Wikipedia articles which describe the\n",
      "sound and usually have an audio record of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Vowels\n",
      "\n",
      "There are five proper vowels in Lojban and one almost-vowel. First the proper\n",
      "ones:\n",
      "\n",
      "**a** | as in \"father\" or \"large\"   \n",
      "---|---  \n",
      "**e** | as in \"get\" or \"gem\"   \n",
      "**i** | as in \"machine\" or \"scream\" (not as in \"hit\")   \n",
      "**o** | as in \"bold\" or \"more\" — not as in \"so\" (this should be a 'pure' sound.)   \n",
      "**u** | as in \"rude\" or \"due\" (not as in \"but\")   \n",
      "**y** | as \"a\" in \"Tina\" (not as in \"but\")   \n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "These are pretty much the same as vowels in Italian or Spanish. The sixth\n",
      "(almost-)vowel, **y** , is called a \"schwa\" in the language trade, and is\n",
      "pronounced as \"comm _a_ \", \"tak _e_ n\" or \"s _u_ rprise!\". It's the sound that\n",
      "comes out when the mouth is completely relaxed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two vowels together are pronounced as one sound (and called a \"diphthong\").\n",
      "Some examples are:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "**ai** | as in \"high\"   \n",
      "---|---  \n",
      "**au** | as in \"how\"   \n",
      "**ei** | as in \"hey\"   \n",
      "**oi** | as in \"boy\"   \n",
      "**ia** | as in \"yacht\"   \n",
      "**ie** | as in \"yes\"   \n",
      "**iu** | as in \"you\"   \n",
      "**ua** | as in \"wander\"   \n",
      "**ue** | as in \"wet\"   \n",
      "**uo** | as in \"woke\"   \n",
      "**ui** | as in \"we\"   \n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "**i** and **u** act as semivowels when they precede another vowel. Double\n",
      "vowels are rare. The only examples are **ii** , which is pronounced like\n",
      "English \"ye\" (as in _Oh come all ye faithful_) or Chinese \"yi\", and **uu** ,\n",
      "pronounced like \"woo\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that because of variation between English dialects, approximations like\n",
      "these will necessarily be wrong for some speakers. The surest way to learn the\n",
      "phonology of the language is to imitate those who already speak it!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Consonants\n",
      "\n",
      "There are seventeen consonants in Lojban and one almost-consonant. The Lojban\n",
      "consonants are the same as the English, except that Lojban doesn't use the\n",
      "letters H, Q or W. Most of the consonants are pronounced like in English, but\n",
      "there are some exceptions:\n",
      "\n",
      "**g** always \"g\" as in \"gum\", never \"g\" as in \"gem\"  \n",
      "---  \n",
      "**c** \"sh\", as in \"ship\"  \n",
      "**j** as in \"measure\" or French \"bonjour\"  \n",
      "**x** as in the exclamation \"Ach!\", or in German \"Bach\", Spanish \"Jose\" or\n",
      "Arabic \"Khaled\"  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "The almost-consonant is the apostrophe This letter is pronounced like the\n",
      "English letter H, but is only used between two vowels to prevent them from\n",
      "running into each other. Thus **ui** is normally pronounced \"we\", but **u'i**\n",
      "is \"oohee\". Groups of cmavo are called selma'o and are written using capital\n",
      "letters; but unexpectedly the capital version of this letter is **h** not H\n",
      "(ko'a is KOhA).\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination **dj** is like the **j** in \"joke\". The combination **tc** is\n",
      "like the **ch** in \"chat\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The following sound as they do in English, with the exception that **r** is\n",
      "often rolled (but does not have to be):\n",
      "\n",
      "**b** , **d** , **f** , **k** , **l** , **m** , **n** , **p** , **r** , **s**\n",
      ", **t** , **v** , **z**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Letter names\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of the letters, what are the names for them? For example, when\n",
      "reciting the alphabet in English the letter C is pronounced \"see\". This is\n",
      "rather different than the sound the letter makes when used in a word. How\n",
      "about Lojban? Well, consonants are straightforward: The name of a consonant\n",
      "letter is the sound of that letter, plus **y**. So the consonant letters of\n",
      "Lojban, \"b, c, d, f, g ...\", are called **by cy dy fy gy** in Lojban. The\n",
      "almost-consonant **'** is called **.y'y** (pronounced like an agreeing uh-huh\n",
      "but without the stress).\n",
      "\n",
      "Vowels are handled by following the vowel sound with the word **bu** , which\n",
      "signifies we're speaking about a symbol. So the vowels of Lojban are: **.abu\n",
      ".ebu .ibu .obu .ubu and .ybu**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly you should know that stress is placed on the second-to-last syllable in\n",
      "words with more than one syllable, ignoring syllables containing **y** , and\n",
      "that one-syllable words are not stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Correct pronunciation\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't have to be very precise about Lojban pronunciation, because the\n",
      "phonemes are distributed so that it is hard to mistake one sound for another.\n",
      "This means that rather than one 'correct' pronunciation, there is a range of\n",
      "acceptable pronunciation—the general principle is that anything is OK so long\n",
      "as it doesn't sound too much like something else. For example, Lojban **r**\n",
      "can be pronounced like the \"R\" in English, Scottish or French.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two things to be careful of, though, are pronouncing Lojban **i** and **u**\n",
      "like Standard British English \"hit\" and \"but\" (Northern English \"but\" is\n",
      "fine!). This is because non-Lojban vowels, particularly these two, are used to\n",
      "separate consonants by people who find them hard to say. For example, if you\n",
      "have problems spitting out the **zd** in **zdani** (house), you can say\n",
      "**zɪdani** — where the **ɪ** is very short, but the final **i** has to be\n",
      "long.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Writing Lojban\n",
      "\n",
      "As you have already seen, Lojban uses the Latin alphabet, though various\n",
      "Lojbanists have suggested different, usually self-designed ones. Furthermore,\n",
      "Lojban almost always uses lower-case letters. Capital letters are only used to\n",
      "mark stress in proper names, but people tend to avoid them even in names.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the letters, some punctuation is used:\n",
      "\n",
      "A full stop (period) is a glottal stop (the consonant in the middle of \"uh-\n",
      "oh\") or a short pause. The rules of Lojban make it easier for one word to run\n",
      "into another when the second word begins with a vowel; so any word starting\n",
      "with a vowel conventionally has a full stop placed in front of it. Full stops\n",
      "are not usually used to end sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Commas are rare in Lojban. They are only used to emphasize boundaries between\n",
      "syllables, and adding or removing commas never changes a word's pronunciation\n",
      "or meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following are found writing styles of different Lojbanists, but they are\n",
      "not conventional:\n",
      "\n",
      "Spaces are usually used between words. They are mandatory between some words\n",
      "(more on that in lesson thirteen). Double or triple space is sometimes used\n",
      "before the beginning of new sentences. This is to clearly mark sentence shift\n",
      "visually. This might compensate for lack of capital letters which are used for\n",
      "the same purpose in English.\n",
      "\n",
      "In òrder to visuàlly reprèsent the stress on the penultìmate syllàble, and\n",
      "bècause they find it visuàlly plèasing, some pèople use grave or acute àccents\n",
      "òver the vòwel of those syllàbles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people borrow other punctuation marks from English, even though they are\n",
      "not canon, and Lojban is equipped with actual words which should compensate\n",
      "for any punctuation one might want to use. Nonetheless, question marks, for\n",
      "example, clearly marks a sentence as a question and is much easier to catch\n",
      "with the eye than any word is, and so some Lojbanists use them. Quotation\n",
      "marks, parenthesis and exclamations marks can be used similarly. While this is\n",
      "not ungrammatical, since that doesn't interfere with the sentences, some\n",
      "people think exotic punctuation creates an unwanted difference between written\n",
      "and spoken Lojban, generally a big no-no.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Lojbanized foreign proper names (cmevla)\n",
      "\n",
      "The following names are Lojbanized - their sounds are transcribed into Lojban\n",
      "and their ending sound have been changed to a consonant. The final consonant\n",
      "is necessary, because that's how foreign names are differentiated from Lojban\n",
      "words. Again, more on that in lesson thirteen.\n",

      "## Lesson 1: Bridi, jufra, sumti and selbri\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bridi** is the most central unit of Lojban utterances. The concept is very\n",
      "close to what we call a proposition in English. A bridi is a claim that some\n",
      "objects stand in a relation to each other, or that an object has some\n",
      "property. This stands in contrast to **jufra** , which are merely Lojban\n",
      "utterances, which can be bridi or anything else being said. The difference\n",
      "between a bridi and a jufra is that a jufra does not necessarily state\n",
      "anything, while a bridi does. Thus, a bridi might be true or false, while not\n",
      "all jufra can be said to be such.\n",
      "\n",
      "To have some examples (in English, to begin with), _Mozart was the greatest\n",
      "musician of all time_ is a bridi, because it makes a claim with a truth value,\n",
      "and it involves an object, Mozart, and a property, being the greatest musician\n",
      "of all time. On the contrary, _Ow! My toe!_ is not a bridi, since it does not\n",
      "involve a relation, and thus does not state anything. Both, though, are jufra.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try to identify the bridi among these English jufra:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. _I hate it when you do that._\n",
      "  2. _Woah, that looks delicious!_\n",
      "  3. _Geez, not again._\n",
      "  4. _No, I own three cars_\n",
      "  5. _Nineteen minutes past eight._\n",
      "  6. _This Saturday, yes._\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: 1, 2 and 4 are bridi. The rest contain no relation or claim of a\n",
      "property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put in Lojban terms, a bridi consists of one **selbri** , and one or more\n",
      "**sumti**. The selbri is the relation or claim about the object, and the sumti\n",
      "are the objects which are in a relation. Note that _object_ is not a perfect\n",
      "translation of **sumti** , since sumti can refer to not just physical objects,\n",
      "but can also purely abstract things like \"_The idea of warfare_ \". A better\n",
      "translation would be something like \"_subject, direct or indirect object_ \"\n",
      "for **sumti** , and _main verb_ for **selbri** , though, as we will see, this\n",
      "is not optimal either.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can now write the first important lesson down:\n",
      "\n",
      "bridi = selbri + one or more sumti\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "Put another way, a bridi states that some sumti do/are something explained by\n",
      "a selbri.\n",
      "\n",
      "Identify the sumti and selbri equivalents in these English jufra:\n",
      "\n",
      "> I will pick up my daughters with my car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: selbri: _pick up (with)_. sumti: _I_ , _my daughters_ , _my car_\n",
      "\n",
      "> He bought 5 new shirts from Mark for just two hundred euro!\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: selbri: _bought (from) (for)_ sumti: _He_ , _5 new shirts_ , _Mark_\n",
      "and _two hundred euros_\n",
      "\n",
      "Since these concepts are so fundamental to Lojban, let's have a third example:\n",
      "\n",
      "> So far, the EPA has done nothing about the amount of sulphur dioxide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: selbri: _has done (about)_ sumti: _The EPA_ , _nothing_ and _the\n",
      "amount of sulphur dioxide_\n",
      "\n",
      "Now try begin making Lojban bridi. For this you will need to use some words,\n",
      "which can act as selbri:\n",
      "\n",
      "    **dunda** = _x 1 gives x2 to x3 (without payment)_\n",
      "    **pelxu** = _x 1 is yellow_\n",
      "    **zdani** = _x 1 is a home of x2_\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that these words meaning _give_ , _yellow_ and _home_ would be\n",
      "considered a verb, an adjective and a noun in English. In Lojban, there are no\n",
      "such categories and no such distinction. **dunda** can be translated _gives_\n",
      "(verb), _is a giver_ (noun), _is giving_ (adjective) as well as to an adverb\n",
      "form. They all act as selbri, and are used in the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as a few words, which can act as sumti:\n",
      "\n",
      "    **mi** = _\"I\" or \"we\" – the one or those who are speaking_\n",
      "    **ti** = _\"this\" – a close thing or event nearby which can be pointed to by the speaker_\n",
      "    **do** = _\"you\" – the one or those who are being spoken to_\n",

      "  * **_cmevla_** are very easy to identify because they begin and end with a pause, signaled by a full stop in writing, and the last letter is a consonant. Cmevla have two functions: They can either act as a proper name, if prefixed by the article **la** (explained in next lesson), or they can act as the content of a quote. As previously stated, one can mark stress in the names by capitalizing the letters which are stressed. Examples of cmevla are: **.io'AN.** (Johan), **.mat.** (Matt) and **.cumindzyn.** (Xuming Zeng). Names which do not end in consonants have to have one added: **.anas.** (Anna), or removed: **.an.**\n",
      "  * **_brivla_** are called _bridi-words_ because they by default are selbri, and therefore almost all Lojban words with a place structure are brivla. This has also given them the English nickname _content-words_. It's nearly impossible to say anything useful without brivla, and almost all words for concepts outside lojban grammar (and even most of the words for things in the language) are captured by brivla. As shown in the table, brivla has three subcategories:\n",
      "  * **_gismu_** are the root words of the language. Only about 1450 exist, and very few new ones are added. They cover the most basic concepts like _circle_ , _friend_ , _tree_ and _dream_. Examples include **zdani** , **pelxu** and **dunda**\n",
      "  * **_lujvo_** are made by combining rafsi (see under rafsi), respresenting gismu. By combining rafsi, one narrows down the meaning of the word. lujvo are made by an elaborate algorithm, so making valid lujvo on the fly is near impossible, with few exceptions like **selpa'i** , from **se prami** , which can only have one definition. Instead, lujvo are made once, its place structure defined, and then that definition is made official by the dictionary. Examples include brivla (bridi-word), **cinjikca** (sexual-socializing = flirting) and **cakcinki** (shell-insect = beetle).\n",
      "  * **_zi'evla_** are made by making up words which fit the definition for brivla, but not for lujvo or gismu. They tend to cover concepts which it's hard to cover by lujvo, for instance names of species, nations or very cultural specific concepts. Examples include **xanguke** (South Korea) **cidjrpitsa** (pizza) or **.angeli** (angel).\n",
      "  * **_cmavo_** are small words with one or zero consonants. They tend to not signify anything in the exterior world, but to have only grammatical function. Exceptions occur, and it's debatable how much attitudinals exists for their grammatical function. Another weird example are the words of the class GOhA, which act as brivla. It is valid to type several cmavo in a row as one word, but in these lessons, that won't be done. By grouping certain cmavo in functional units, though, it is sometimes easier to read. Thus, **uipuzuvukumi citka** is valid, and is parsed and understood as **ui pu zu vu ku mi citka**. Like other Lojban words, one should (but need not always) place a full stop before any words beginning with a vowel. \n",
      "    * cmavo of the form xVV, CV'VV or V'VV are experimental, and are words which are not in the official language definition, but which have been added by Lojban users to respond to a certain need.\n",
      "  * **_rafsi_** are not Lojban words, and can never appear alone. However, several (more than one) rafsi combine to form lujvo. These must still live up to the brivla-definition, for instance **lojban** is invalid because it ends in a consonant (which makes it a cmevla), and **ci'ekei** is invalid because it does not contain a consonant cluster, and is thus read as two cmavo written as one word. Often, a 3-4 letter string is both a cmavo and a rafsi, like **zu'e** , which is both the BAI and the rafsi for **zukte**. Note that there is nowhere that both a cmavo and a rafsi would be grammatical, so these are not considered homophones. All gismu can double as (word-final) rafsi, if they are prefixed with another rafsi. The first four letter of a gismu suffixed with an \"y\" can also act as a rafsi, if they are suffixed with another rafsi. The vowel \"y\" can only appear in lujvo or cmevla. Valid rafsi letter combinations are: CVV, CV'V, CCV, CVCCy- CCVCy-, -CVCCV and -CCVCV.\n",

      "cleared up:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * **zo'e** have to refer to something which is claimed to have a value. _zero cars_ or _nothing_ , for instance, has no value, and therefore cannot be referred to by **zo'e**. This is because, if it could mean _nothing_ by **zo'e** , then any selbri could be identical to its negation, if one of the elided sumti were filled with a **zo'e** with no value.\n",
      "  * **ge'e** does not mean that you feel no emotion, just that you feel nothing special or worth to mention at the moment. It's similar to _I'm fine._. **ge'e pei** ask about an elliptical emotion and is a good translation for: _How are you feeling?_.\n",
      "  * **co'e** is handy when needing a selbri in a construct for grammatical reasons, like in the definition of **tu'a** in the previous lesson.\n",
      "  * **ju'a** does not change the truth value or subjective understanding of the bridi or anything like that. In fact, it's mostly does nothing. However, **ju'a pei** , _What is your basis for saying that?_ is handy.\n",
      "  * **do'i** is really useful. A lot of times when you refer to utterances or conversations by words like _this_ or _that_ , you want **do'i**.\n",
      "  * If you fill in more sumti than a selbri has places for, the last sumti have implied **do'e** sumtcita in front of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, there is a word, **zi'o** , that you can fill a sumti place with\n",
      "to delete it from any selbri. **lo melbi be zi'o** , for instance, is just\n",
      "_Something beautiful_ , and does not include the usual x2 of **melbi** , which\n",
      "is the observer who judges something to be beautiful. Thus, it can mean\n",
      "something like _Objectively beautiful._ It does not state that nothing fills\n",
      "the sumti place which is being deleted, just that the sumti place is not being\n",
      "considered in the selbri. Using **zi'o** with a sumtcita gives weird results.\n",
      "Formally, they should cancel each other out. Practically, it would probably be\n",

      "hard to grasp, but easy to work with once you know it. It has two distinct,\n",

      "distributively. A group of objects considered distributively means that the\n",

      "properties than each of the individuals do. The distinction between\n",
      "distributivity (individual-like) and non-distributivity (mass-like) is of\n",
      "relevance when quantifying sumti.\n",

      "unlucky man could have been bitten by all three dogs), whereas if the men\n",
      "distribute over then dogs, then two men were each bitten by tree dogs, fixing\n",
      "the number of men to 2, but allowing between 3 and 6 dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "When there can be any doubt as to which sumti distributes over which, the rule\n",
      "is _that the first mentioned sumti always distributes over the last\n",
      "mentioned_. This is irrespective of place structure, so if x1 and x2 are\n",
      "switched with **se** , x2, which is mentioned first, will distribute over x1.\n",

      "Of course one dog exists, but in Lojban, **pa da zo'u da gerku** means not\n",

      "\n",

      "thing exists _in the domain of truth where it's used_. Thus, in the sentence\n",
      "**so'e verba cu krici lo du'u su'o da crida** , does not state **da crida** ,\n",
      "since its \"domain of truth\" is only inside the du'u-abstraction. Generally\n",
      "speaking, abstractions contain their own domain of truth, so using **da** and\n",
      "friends inside an abstraction is usually safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- If the same variable is quantified several times, the first quantification\n",
      "is the one which sticks: Any later quantified instance of that variable can\n",
      "refer only to things which are also being referred to by the first instance of\n",
      "that variable, and any later non-quantified instance of that variable will\n",
      "gain the first quantifier. To use an example: **ci da zo'u re da barda .ije da\n",

      "is not official, but rather an (educated) opinion on the language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad grammar is easy to spot in Lojban - in fact it's unambiguously correct or\n",
      "not. In contrast, saying that a jufra is semantically wrong is the same as\n",
      "saying that the speaker is using Lojban to think wrongly about the world. It's\n",
      "not saying \"You can't say X\" as much as \"You can't interpret X in this way.\n",
      "You should interpret it this way\". Placing these restrictions on composing and\n",

      "This is a matter of measure. Given that extreme, that is, if no semantic\n",
      "standards were set, everything could mean anything, and all communication\n",
      "would be meaningless. In any language which aims to facilitate communication,\n",
      "one must be able to express oneself in such a way that one can trust that\n",
      "one’s message is interpreted in the desired way. Semantic rules of Lojban do\n",

      "people from saying B and having others think they meant A.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lesson is on types. The word _type_ , informally translated to **klesi**\n",
      ", is used by Lojbanists to describe the existential nature of the things sumti\n",
      "describe. This nature is, and must be, the same as the nature of the things\n",
      "described by other languages such as English. However, in Lojban, the\n",

      "certainty is not philosophically well grounded. Taking a materialistic\n",
      "viewpoint, the natural world of particles and waves does not correspond well\n",
      "with human understanding of say, hatred, which is not defined by any specific\n",
      "particles, nor any specific brain activity. It is a purely abstract concept.\n",
      "Similarly, in an extreme inductionist viewpoint, such as that taken by Hume,\n",
      "all we humans experience are subjective impressions over time - a long string\n",
      "of events, or, some people argue, a bunch of qualia (This is _green_. This is\n",
      "_crispy_. This is _round_. This is _tasty_. => \"This is an apple\".) This\n",

      "narrow field (e.g. “quark”, “integral”, or “iambic pentameter”). These words\n",

      "\n",
      "There are four stages of borrowing in Lojban, as words become more and more\n",
      "modified (but shorter and easier to use). Stage 1 is the use of a foreign name\n",
      "quoted with the cmavo “la'o” (explained in full in Chapter 19):\n",

      "full command of the Lojban vocabulary, provided you are talking to someone who\n",
      "will recognize the borrowing.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Where a little more universality is desired, the word to be borrowed must be\n",
      "Lojbanized into one of several permitted forms. A rafsi is then usually\n",

      "that the resulting word doesn’t fall apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rafsi categorizes or limits the meaning of the fu'ivla; otherwise a word\n",
      "having several different jargon meanings in other languages would require the\n",

      "Finally, Stage 4 fu'ivla do not have any rafsi classifier, and are used where\n",
      "a fu'ivla has become so common or so important that it must be made as short\n",
      "as possible. (See Section 16 for a proposal concerning Stage 4 fu'ivla.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The form of a fu'ivla reliably distinguishes it from both the gismu and the\n",
      "cmavo. Like cultural gismu, fu'ivla are generally based on a word from a\n",
      "single non-Lojban language. The word is “borrowed” (actually “copied”, hence\n",

      "phonemes are converted to their closest Lojban equivalent and modifications\n",
      "are made as necessary to make the word a legitimate Lojban fu'ivla-form word.\n",
      "All fu'ivla:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. must contain a consonant cluster in the first five letters of the word; if this consonant cluster is at the beginning, it must either be a permissible initial consonant pair, or a longer cluster such that each pair of adjacent consonants in the cluster is a permissible initial consonant pair: “spraile” is acceptable, but not “ktraile” or “trkaile”;\n",
      "  2. must end in one or more vowels;\n",
      "  3. must not be gismu or lujvo, or any combination of cmavo, gismu, and lujvo; furthermore, a fu'ivla with a CV cmavo joined to the front of it must not have the form of a lujvo (the so-called “slinku'i test”, not discussed further in this book);\n",
      "  4. cannot contain “y”, although they may contain syllabic pronunciations of Lojban consonants;\n",
      "  5. like other brivla, are stressed on the penultimate syllable.\n",

      "  1. Eliminate all double consonants and silent letters.\n",
      "  2. Convert all sounds to their closest Lojban equivalents. Lojban “y”, however, may not be used in any fu'ivla.\n",
      "  3. If the last letter is not a vowel, modify the ending so that the word ends in a vowel, either by removing a final consonant or by adding a suggestively chosen final vowel.\n",
      "  4. If the first letter is not a consonant, modify the beginning so that the word begins with a consonant, either by removing an initial vowel or adding a suggestively chosen initial consonant.\n",
      "  5. Prefix the result of steps 1-5 with a 4-letter rafsi that categorizes the fu'ivla into a “topic area”. It is only safe to use a 4-letter rafsi; short rafsi sometimes produce invalid fu'ivla. Hyphenate the rafsi to the rest of the fu'ivla with an “r”-hyphen; if that would produce a double “r”, use an “n”-hyphen instead; if the rafsi ends in “r” and the rest of the fu'ivla begins with “n” (or vice versa), or if the rafsi ends in \"r\" and the rest of the fu'ivla begins with \"tc\", \"ts\", \"dj\", or \"dz\" (using \"n\" would result in a phonotactically impermissible cluster), use an “l”-hyphen. (This is the only use of “l”-hyphen in Lojban.)\n",
