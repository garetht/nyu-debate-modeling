CoT Answer for jbo_1:
1. The debater provides two <verified_quote> entries defining 'pensi' and 'jinvi'. 2. The ‘pensi’ quote shows it means ‘think on a topic’, not ‘opine that a du’u is true’. 3. The ‘jinvi’ quote explicitly says ‘x1 thinks/opines that du’u is true’. 4. The English sentence expresses an opinion about the truth of ‘we need to hurry’. 5. Therefore using ‘jinvi lo du’u…’ is correct. The quotes directly support choice B, so the argument is valid.


CoT Answer for jbo_4:
The debater only recites general glosses and a stray verified quote defining cmavo but provides no citation or rule about using ku’o versus ku in NOI clauses. They haven’t shown why sentence A is mandatory or superior. Their claims aren’t backed by explicit evidence from the source text, so the conclusion isn’t supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_7:
The debater correctly identifies that ‘gacri’ means ‘cover’ and that ‘cu’ is the standard selbri separator. Both quotes are verified. Using ‘cu’ avoids parsing ambiguity between the first sumti and the selbri. Thus their recommendation of .ei lo grasu cu gacri lo palne is well supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_9:
They correctly identify that a yes/no question in Lojban takes xu + bridi, and that ‘jdima’ is the gismu for price (verified via the provided quote). Hence ‘xu do djuno lo jdima be lo nanba’ literally asks ‘Do you know the price of the bread?’ without introducing an unnecessary indirect question structure. Their conclusion that A is the better translation is therefore supported.
