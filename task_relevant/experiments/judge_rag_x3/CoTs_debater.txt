CoT Answer for jbo_1:
First, we distinguish the two Lojban gismu: pensi and jinvi. According to the background, pensi means “to think/consider/cogitate about a topic,” whereas jinvi specifically means “to opine.” For example, the dictionary entry for pensi states:
<verified_quote lines=5800-5802>{"Lojban": "pensi", "English": "- think; on a topic", "Type": "gismu", "Def": "x_{1} thinks/considers/cogitates/reasons/is pensive about/reflects upon subject/concept x_{2}."},</verified_quote>
But the entry for jinvi reads:
<verified_quote lines=5802-5804>{"Lojban": "jinvi", "English": "- opine", "Type": "gismu", "Def": "x_{1} thinks/opines x_{2} [opinion] (du'u) is true about subject/issue x_{3} on grounds x_{4}."},</verified_quote>
In English, “I think we need to hurry up” expresses an opinion rather than mere reflection on a concept. Thus, the more accurate translation uses jinvi, giving: mi jinvi lo du'u mi'a nitcu lo ka sutryze'a.
