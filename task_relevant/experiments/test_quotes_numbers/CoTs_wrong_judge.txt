CoT Answer for jbo_3:
The crucial point is whether you can skip place 2 of se finti and let the next sumti fill place 3 by position alone. Lojban’s sumti‐filling rule says untagged sumti fill the lowest unfilled place. After se finti, place 2 (the inventor) remains unfilled, so an untagged purpose sumti would wrongly go into place 2 unless you explicitly tag it with fi to target place 3. Only the argument for using fi is backed by legitimate <quote>…</quote> citations from finti’s place structure and the definition of fi. The opposing argument, claiming position‐only filling, has no quoted support and contradicts the standard rule. Thus the translation requiring fi (answer B) is correct, so Debater_B wins.


CoT Answer for jbo_6:
The quoted place‐structure <quote>dunda: x1 gives x2 to x3</quote> shows in B ‘ra dunda su’o fukpi ro lamgre’ we have x1=ra, x2=su’o fukpi, x3=ro lamgre, exactly “she gave a (copy) to everyone.” A’s convoluted FA tags aren’t needed and were even mis-read by Debater_A. B is the simpler, correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_10:
The quotes show the JAI operator must precede the selbri, as in <quote>jai bau cusku fai mi</quote>. By analogy, the selbri must be ‘jai cumki carvi’ with ‘fa lo bavlamdei’ supplying the original x1. Choice A misplaces JAI after ‘carvi’ and thus fails the modal‐conversion pattern. Therefore, B is correct.
