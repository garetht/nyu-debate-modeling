CoT Answer for jbo_1:
The English “I think we need to hurry up” is an assertion of belief, not mere reflection. In Lojban, jinvi expresses “I opine/believe that p is true,” matching the idiom “I think (i.e. I believe) that….” Pensi only indicates reflective thought, not endorsement. Therefore the correct rendering is mi jinvi lo du'u mi'a nitcu lo ka sutryze'a.


CoT Answer for jbo_2:
Debater_A’s quotes (all marked valid) establish that tcati’s x2 place holds the leaf source and that in Lojban tanru the modifier precedes the head. Thus plise tcati means apple tea. Debater_B gave no valid quotes. Therefore A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_4:
Both sides quote definitions of ku and ku’o. Ku’o explicitly ends a relative clause; ku only ends a description/sumti. In B the poi‐clause never closes, folding “lo dakli pe do” into the clause. In A ku’o cleanly closes the relative clause then starts the next sumti. Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_5:
We need to conjoin three separate groups of visitors (Mexicans, Serbs, Indians) as distinct sumti, not merge them into one tanru. The tanru‐connector je binds brivla into a single composite predicate, yielding an entity that is simultaneously Mexican, Serbian, and Indian. That does not match the English. The sumti‐level connector .e properly links separate sumti, giving three cohorts all falling under the same predicate “ta’e se vitke” after lo gusta pe mi'a. Therefore B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_7:
Cu is required to separate lo grasu from the selbri gacri. Without cu the gismu gacri attaches as a tanru modifier to lo grasu, leaving no selbri. .ei is an attitudinal, not a terminator, so it cannot block tanru formation. Only cu (which Debater_B quotes correctly) unambiguously marks gacri as selbri. Therefore B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_8:
The only explicit <quote> shows nupre’s canonical order is x1=promiser, x2=event/state, x3=beneficiary. Debater B then misassigns do as x2 contrary to that quote. Debater A’s use of fi and fe correctly places you in x3 and the promised event in x2, matching the dictionary’s structure. Therefore A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_9:
The dictionary quote provided shows djuno’s second place x2 must be a bridi abstraction introduced by du'u. Choice A supplies a bare sumti, which conflicts with that place structure. Choice B correctly forms x2 as a du'u-clause (‘what is the price of the bread’) via ma kau. Therefore B is the proper Lojban translation.
