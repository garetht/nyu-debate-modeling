1. The English sentence “I think we need to hurry up” expresses the speaker’s opinion that the proposition “we need to hurry up” is true, not merely that the speaker is pondering or reflecting on it.  
2. According to the background, “jinvi” is defined as “x1 opines x2 (opinion) is true about subject x3 on grounds x4.”  This matches the intended meaning of “I think that …” as an assertion of belief in a proposition: <quote>“jinvi: x1 thinks/opines x2 [opinion] (du'u) is true about subject/issue x3 on grounds x4.”</quote>  
3. By contrast, “pensi” is defined as “x1 thinks/considers/cogitates/reasons/is pensive about/reflects upon subject/concept x2.”  It indicates reflective thought rather than endorsement or assertion of truth: <quote>“pensi: x1 thinks/considers/cogitates/reasons/is pensive about/reflects upon subject/concept x2.”</quote>  
4. Using “mi pensi lo du'u …” would only mean “I reflect on the proposition …,” without asserting that I believe it, which fails to capture the idiomatic “I think (i.e. I believe) that ….”  
5. Therefore the correct translation is “mi jinvi lo du'u mi'a nitcu lo ka sutryze'a,” using “jinvi” to express the opinion that “we need to hurry up.”


CoT Answer for jbo_2:
We want to say “Did you drink apple tea?” in Lojban.  The gismu tcati has place structure “x1 is tea brewed from leaves x2.”  To express tea made from apple leaves, we put the leaf-source sumti (apple) in x2, yielding lo plise tcati.  <quote>“x1 is made of/contains/is a quantity of tea brewed from leaves x2.”</quote>  In Lojban tanru (compound) constructions, modifiers precede their head: the head is final.  For example, blabi karce means “white car,” with blabi (white) modifying karce (car).  <quote>“Example 8.17. / blabi karce / white car.”</quote>  Thus plise (apple) must precede tcati (tea) to mean “apple tea.”

By contrast, Debater_B’s suggestion “lo tcati plise ku xu” inverts the tanru order, treating tcati as modifier and plise as head.  That would mean “tea apple,” i.e. an apple of tea, not a tea of apple leaves.  No evidence in the grammar allows reversing the order except by using the cmavo co to invert a tanru, which is not present here.  Therefore only A correctly renders “apple tea.”


CoT Answer for jbo_3:
The gismu finti has the place structure “x1 invents x2 for function/purpose x3 from existing elements x4.” <quote>x_{1} invents/creates/composes/authors x_{2} for function/purpose x_{3} from existing elements/ideas x_{4}.</quote> We are translating “The picture was made to shock visitors,” so “lo pixra” = x1 (the product) and the inventor (x2) is omitted via se-conversion. By prefixing se to finti we swap x1 and x2, so the remaining unfilled purpose is still in place 3. To fill place 3 we must use the cmavo fi, which is the tag for the 3rd sumti place: <quote>fi … Definition: tag 3rd sumti place.</quote> Answer (A) omits fi, which would wrongly place the purpose sumti into x2 (the inventor), not into x3. In contrast, (B) uses fi to slot “lo ka jai spaji lo vitke” into the purpose place, correctly rendering “made in order to shock visitors.” Debater_B’s (A) therefore misassigns the purpose argument and is incorrect.


CoT Answer for jbo_4:
The core issue is that a restrictive relative clause introduced by poi must be closed with the cmavo ku'o (the "end relative clause" terminator), not with ku (which only ends a plain sumti).  In translation B, writing "lo cukta poi cpana lo jubme ku lo dakli pe do" uses ku instead of ku'o, so ku merely closes the description "lo jubme" and leaves the poi–relative clause unclosed.  As a result, the final bag phrase "lo dakli pe do" is still inside the relative clause, yielding the nonsensical reading “books which are on the table into your bag,” rather than “put into your bag the books which are on the table.”  By contrast, translation A properly writes

    ko punji lo cukta poi cpana lo jubme ku'o lo dakli pe do

using <quote>'ku'o' ... 'end relative clause; always elidable, but preferred in complex clauses.'</quote> to terminate the poi clause, then begins the top‐level sumti "lo dakli pe do".  This matches the rule that <quote>'ku' ... 'end description, modal, or negator sumti; often elidable.'</quote> does not serve to close a relative clause.  Therefore only A correctly scopes the relative clause and the bag phrase, making it the valid translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_5:
Debater_B’s choice (A) incorrectly uses the tanru connector <quote>'je'</quote> to join <quote>lo mexno</quote>, <invalid_quote>lo serbo</invalid_quote>, and <quote>lo xindo</quote>. According to the background, <quote>{ 'Lojban': 'je', 'Definition': 'logical connective: tanru-internal afterthought and' }</quote>, “je” conjoins brivla within a single tanru, yielding entities that are simultaneously Mexican, Serbian, and Indian. That fails to match the English meaning, which refers to three separate groups of people. Instead, we need the sumti-level conjunction <quote>{ 'Lojban': '.e', 'Definition': 'logical connective: sumti afterthought and' }</quote>. Using <quote>'.e'</quote> between full sumti correctly produces three distinct cohorts: <invalid_quote>lo mexno .e lo serbo .e lo xindo</invalid_quote>. Therefore the proper translation is (B) lo gusta pe mi'a lo mexno .e lo serbo .e lo xindo ta'e se vitke.


CoT Answer for jbo_6:
1. In Lojban, the gismu <quote>dunda</quote> has place structure “x1 gives x2 to x3”. Thus the first sumti after <quote>dunda</quote> (if untagged) is x1 (the donor), the next is x2 (the gift), and the third is x3 (the recipient). B’s proposal <quote>ra dunda su'o fukpi ro lamgre</quote> places <quote>su'o fukpi</quote> in the x1 place and <quote>ro lamgre</quote> in x2, yielding the wrong roles (“at least one copy” as donor).  

2. To correctly render “She (x1) gave a copy (x2) to everyone that came by (x3)”, we must explicitly tag the sumti with FA cmavo.  
  • <quote>fi</quote> tags the 3rd sumti place (recipient): “x3 = everyone that came by.”  
  • <quote>fe</quote> tags the 2nd sumti place (gift): “x2 = at least one copy.”  
As stated, <quote>fa, fe, fi, fo, fu may be inserted just before the sumti in the x1 to x5 places respectively</quote> (section-FA).  

3. Hence A, <quote>ra dunda fi ro lamgre fe su'o fukpi</quote>, parses as:  
  x1 = ra (“she” – recent sumti)  
  x2 = fe su'o fukpi (“gift = at least one copy”)  
  x3 = fi ro lamgre (“recipient = each passerby”).  
This correctly captures “for each passerby, she gave at least one copy”.  

4. By contrast, B’s lack of FA tags mis-assigns the roles, making the copy the donor rather than the gift. Therefore, only A yields the intended meaning.


CoT Answer for jbo_7:
1. The English sentence “The oil should cover the pan” requires an attitudinal marker for “should” (.ei), a subject sumti (“the oil”), a predicate (“cover”), and an object sumti (“the pan”).
2. In Lojban, “the oil” is expressed as “lo grasu”. Without any separator, a following gismu attaches into the same sumti as a tanru modifier. In sentence A, “lo grasu gacri lo palne” parses as a single tanru sumti (something like “the oil-cover greasy pan”), leaving no selbri for the bridi.
3. The cmavo <quote>‘cu’</quote> is precisely the selbri separator that prevents this misparsing. As defined:
   <quote>“elidable marker: separates selbri from preceding sumti, allows preceding terminator elision”</quote>
4. By inserting <quote>‘cu’</quote> between “lo grasu” and “gacri”, answer B correctly marks “gacri” as the selbri of the bridi, so the structure becomes:
   .ei | lo grasu | cu | gacri | lo palne
   [Obligation!] the-oil SELBRI cover the-pan
5. Therefore, “.ei lo grasu cu gacri lo palne” (B) is the only grammatical and unambiguous translation of “The oil should cover the pan.”


CoT Answer for jbo_8:
The gismu <quote>nupre</quote> has the place structure “x1 promises x2 to x3” (agent x1, event/state x2, beneficiary x3). In English “I promise you I won't eat any of the meat,” the promised event is NOT eating meat, and the beneficiary of the promise is “you.” Thus in Lojban we need to place the event in x2 and the person in x3. FA tags <quote>fe</quote> (2nd sumti place) and <quote>fi</quote> (3rd sumti place) precisely allow us to swap the normal order when we speak out of the canonical x1–x2–x3 sequence. 

Answer B, “mi do nupre lo ka citka no lo rectu,” leaves the untagged <quote>do</quote> in x2 and the promised event in x3, wrongly yielding “I promise the event of you to not-eat-meat.” It misassigns you as the thing promised. By contrast, A correctly marks x2 with <quote>fe lo ka citka no lo rectu</quote> and x3 with <quote>fi do</quote>, giving “I promise [the state ‘I won’t eat any meat’] to you,” exactly matching the intended English. 

Therefore the correct translation is A: mi fi do nupre fe lo ka citka no lo rectu.


CoT Answer for jbo_9:
1. The gismu djuno has the place structure “x1 knows fact(s) x2 (du'u) about subject x3…”. In other words, its x2 must be a bridi abstraction introduced by du'u, not a bare sumti. <quote>x1 knows fact(s) x2 (du'u) about subject x3 by epistemology x4.</quote>

2. Choice A uses “lo jdima be lo nanba” as djuno’s x2. That phrase is a sumti describing “the price of the bread” as an object or quantity, not as a proposition or fact. It cannot satisfy the requirement for a du'u abstraction.

3. Choice B correctly turns the question “the price of the bread?” into an indirect question clause “le du'u ma kau jdima lo nanba”, exactly matching the pattern in the background: <quote>mi djuno le du'u ma kau pu klama le zarci</quote> (“I know who went to the store”).

4. Thus only B supplies djuno with a du'u-clause containing ma kau to ask “what price is of the bread,” making B the standard Lojban translation of “Do you know the price of the bread?”


CoT Answer for jbo_10:
1. In Lojban, to express “It might rain tomorrow,” we need “carvi” as the main predicate (to rain), then a JAI-modal conversion on the possibility predicate “cumki,” and finally tag “tomorrow” into the right place with FA.  
2. Section 9.12 shows exactly this pattern:  
   <quote>Example 9.82: mi cusku bau la lojban.</quote>  
   <quote>Example 9.83: la lojban. jai bau cusku fai mi</quote>  
   Here “cusku” is the main selbri, “bau” the modal, “jai bau cusku” does the modal conversion, and “fai mi” re-inserts the old x1.  
3. By direct analogy, we want “carvi” (rain), then “jai cumki” (convert the possibility predicate), then “fa lo bavlamdei” to put “tomorrow” into x1.  That gives exactly “carvi jai cumki fa lo bavlamdei.”  
4. Debater_B’s alternative, “jai cumki carvi fa lo bavlamdei,” misplaces the JAI + modal before the selbri.  As a result, the FA tag <quote>fa lo bavlamdei</quote> attaches to the wrong predicate head, yielding a nonsensical tanru where “tomorrow” becomes the x1 of an unintended compound “jai cumki carvi.”  
5. Only answer A follows the standard JAI-modal pattern from the background and correctly means “It is possible that it will rain tomorrow.”
