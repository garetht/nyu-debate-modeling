CoT Answer for jbo_10:
We want to express “It might rain tomorrow” by saying that the raining event is possible under the condition “tomorrow.”  According to the definition, <verified_quote lines=5828-5830>{"Lojban": "cumki", "English": "- possible", "Type": "gismu", "Def": "x_{1} (event/state/property) is possible under conditions x_{2}; x_{1} may/might occur; x_{1} is a maybe."},</verified_quote> where the selbri is cumki.  In Lojban, cumki’s x₂ place holds the condition (“tomorrow,” i.e. lo bavlamdei).  To bring that modal place into the x₁ position, we use modal conversion JAI.  As explained, <quote>However, it is possible to convert a selbri in such a way that, rather than exchanging two numbered places, a modal place is made into a numbered place.</quote>  In Example 9.83, for instance, <quote>the modal place _la lojban._ has become the x1 place of the new selbri _jai bau cusku_.</quote>  Here we analogously form the new selbri “jai cumki carvi”, whose x₁ is cumki’s old x₂ (the condition).  Finally, we mark that x₁ with FA’s tag for the first place: <verified_quote lines=6520-6523>{"Lojban": "fa", "Formal Language": "FA", "English": "1st sumti place", "Definition": "sumti place tag: tag 1st sumti place", "Type": "cmavo"},    {"Lojban": "ni", "Formal Language": "NU", "English": "amount abstract", "Definition": "abstractor: quantity/amount abstractor; x1 is quantity/amount of [bridi] measured on scale x2", "Type": "cmavo"},</verified_quote>.  Thus the correct bridi is “jai cumki carvi fa lo bavlamdei,” matching choice B.
