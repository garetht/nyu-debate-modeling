CoT Answer for jbo_1:
Both debaters quote the gismu: pensi is internal cogitation; jinvi is voicing an opinion about a proposition. The English sentence is an expressed opinion (“I think we need to hurry”), not mere private reflection. Debater B’s use of jinvi(lo du’u…) matches that nuance. Debater A’s grounds-argument is unsupported: jinvi doesn’t require explicit grounds. Therefore B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_2:
Debater_A provides a genuine grammar quote (<quote>…blabi karce, like all tanru…</quote>) establishing that tanru are head-final: the first word modifies the second. Thus lo plise tcati = “apple-tea.” Debater_B’s quotes only give definitions, not the ordering rule, and their phrasing (lo tcati plise) would mean “tea-apple.” Therefore A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_3:
Debater_B cites the official place structure of finti (x1 invents x2 for purpose x3…) and the fi tag definition, both in <quote> tags. Their reasoning correctly shows that without fi the purpose would be misparsed as the omitted maker (x2). Debater_A offers no quotes, so I can’t trust their claim that elision auto-skips to x3. Therefore B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_4:
Debater_A cites two explicit <quote> tags from section 8.1 stating that a poi‐clause must end with the elidable terminator ku'o. Debater_B’s quotes claim ku can replace ku'o but lack clear authoritative context. I trust the direct rule quotes over the contested elision examples, so A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_5:
The English lists three distinct groups, so in Lojban we need separate sumti joined by the sumti‐and particle .e. The debaters quoted <quote>.e</quote> as “sumti afterthought and” and <quote>je</quote> only as a tanru‐internal binder, which would force a single compound predicate “Mexican‐Serb‐Indian.” Therefore the correct form is with .e, option B.


CoT Answer for jbo_6:
Only Debater_A’s quote-backed example 'da ro de zo'u da viska de' shows existential before universal yields wrong meaning. Debater_B’s claims lack verifiable quotes on scope. A’s use of fi/fe forces the universal (ro lamgre) to scope over the existential (su'o fukpi), matching 'for each passerby there is a copy.' Therefore A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_8:
The gismu nupre has places x1=promiser, x2=event/state, x3=beneficiary (as quoted). In “mi do nupre lo ka citka no lo rectu,” mi and do come before the selbri, filling x1 and x2, and lo ka… after fills x3. That wrongly makes the beneficiary x2 and the event x3. To assign do to x3 and the event to x2 requires tags: fi for x3 and fe for x2. Thus A correctly encodes “I promise you I won’t eat any of the meat.”


CoT Answer for jbo_9:
Djuno’s sumti must be a propositional abstraction (le du’u…kei), not a bare noun. Debater_A’s own quotes show examples like <quote>mi djuno le du'u ma kau pu klama le zarci</quote> requiring du’u…kau. Option A omits this, wrongly treating ‘price of the bread’ as an object. Option B correctly forms an indirect question with lo du'u ma kau jdima lo nanba. Therefore Debater_B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_10:
The only valid quote shows the pattern ‘selbri JAI modal fai x1’ (Example 9.83). That means the main predicate (carvi) comes first, then jai cumki, then the x1 tag. Option A (carvi jai cumki fa lo bavlamdei) matches that ordering; option B does not. Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_12:
We need a selbri denoting the color‐change event “turn red,” not physical rotation. Debater_A’s quotes show carna is about rotating bodies, not color change, and co’a xunre is the standard event‐contour way to express “become red.” Debater_B’s use of xunre carna misapplies carna’s place structure. Therefore (A) is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_16:
The cited grammar (<quote>vau … serves to separate the bridi-tail from the tail-terms…</quote>) shows that in a compound bridi you must spell out VAU so that a following tail-term attaches to both predicates. (A) inserts VAU before “lo ka zerle’a lo cukta,” so “for stealing the books” modifies both punish and forgive, matching the English. (B) omits VAU, attaching the clause only to forgive, which misrepresents the sentence.


CoT Answer for jbo_18:
Debater_A provides explicit quotes showing that nai negates only the word or sumti it follows, while na as a bridi negator must appear with the selbri and cannot sit inside a sumti. Standard Lojban uses .e nai (or fused .enai) to mean “and not” between sumti. Debater_B’s na .e placement contradicts those quoted rules, so A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_19:
1. English “The problem is with the rope and not the wheel” conjoins two full predicates: it is with the rope, and it is not with the wheel. 2. In Lojban, conjoining two bridi‐level statements uses the forethought connector ge … gi. 3. Option B ‹nabmi fa ge tu'a lo skori gi nai tu'a lo xislu› reads “It is both a problem with the rope and not a problem with the wheel.” 4. Option A uses sumti‐level .e nai inside one sumti, yielding an illogical set (‘rope and non‐wheel’) rather than two predicates. 5. Therefore B matches the intended meaning exactly.


CoT Answer for jbo_20:
Debater_A anchors his case in quoted definitions of su’o, ba’o, morji and vajni, showing that su’o attaches to the following sumti and ba’o to the selbri immediately after. This yields “there is at least one important thing that I once remembered (and now don’t),” matching “I’ve forgotten something important.” Debater_B’s objection that A mis‐places ba’o is false—ba’o still directly precedes morji in A—so his reversal of scope is incorrect. Thus (A) is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_21:
We need two separate sumti for ‘largest elm’ and ‘the oak’ as objects of dunda. In (A) the .e is inside the unclosed lo-bardyrai sumti so it yields one object ‘the largest of {elm and oak}.’ In (B) be’o closes the linked sumti after lo .ulmu, so the following .e joins a second top-level sumti lo cindu. Thus (B) correctly gives water to two recipients: the largest elm and the oak.


CoT Answer for jbo_23:
Debater B’s quotes show that ka…kei must enclose only the ‘go west’ intention, so gi’e then connects at the main level to the ‘went north’ bridi, matching ‘intended to go west but instead went north.’ Debater A’s structure without kei forces gi’e inside the ka-abstraction, yielding ‘intended to (go west and go north).’ Thus B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_24:
The English issues two separate put‐actions, each with its own object and location. In Lojban punji is a three‐place bridi (agent, object, location), so we need two full bridi. A uses ge…gi to conjoin two whole punji bridi (‘put empty bottle in bin’ AND ‘put full bottle on table’). B uses .e to conjoin sumti within a single bridi, which would mean ‘put both bottles to both locations,’ misrepresenting the original. Therefore A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_28:
The crux is tanru inversion with co: Debater_A’s quoted rule says after co, sumti fill the seltau’s places, so “lo guzme” becomes x2 of katna, then troci takes the whole clause as its x2 – exactly “try to cut the melon.” Debater_B’s version makes troci’s x2 the melon itself (an object, not an event), which is semantically invalid. Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_29:
The phrase lo ka sazri lo'e relxima is an abstraction sumti started by ka, so it must be closed with kei (the abstraction terminator), not ku (which only closes description or modal sumti). Option B correctly uses kei before do pluka, yielding a well‐formed question asking if you enjoy riding a bike. Option A’s use of ku misterminates the ka‐abstraction and breaks the bridi structure.


CoT Answer for jbo_30:
Both debaters quote the same official definitions of mi’o and mi’a. Mi’o is an inclusive “we” (speaker+listener), while mi’a is exclusive (speaker+others, not listener). English “Let’s watch the sunset” invites the listener to join, so the inclusive mi’o is required. Therefore .e’u mi’o zgana lo solnuncanci is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_32:
The gismu xanri already has x1=the thing imagined and x2=the imaginer (<quote>x1 [concept] … x2</quote>), and <quote>be</quote> attaches a sumti to x2 by default. So lo xanri be ri means “the thing imagined by them.” Embedding that under lo ka gasnu gives “the property of doing what they imagine,” exactly matching “to do what they were imagining.” Using se-xanri would swap places incorrectly. Therefore (A) is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_33:
1. The only fully trustworthy quote is “ro da zo'u da viska mi,” showing that prenex universals with zo'u are the standard pattern. 2. (A) embeds the cook‐quantifier inside the descriptor (“panzi be …”), which works semantically but isn’t the canonical nested quantifier style. 3. (B) places “ro lo so'i jukpa se jibri” in the prenex, then uses ri to pick up each cook and quantify their children, exactly matching the example pattern. 4. Therefore B is the better Lojban translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_34:
1. The linker be attaches the following sumti into the selbri’s x2 place by default. 2. korbi’s x1 is an edge of x2 next to x3. In lo korbi be lo rirxe, korbi is the selbri and lo rirxe fills x2, yielding “edge of the river” (riverbank). 3. zutse expects its x2 to be the surface. Thus la .alis. cu zutse lo korbi be lo rirxe correctly says “Alice sits on the (edge of the river).” 4. The alternative makes rirxe the selbri and korbi its x2, “a river of the bank,” which does not match “riverbank.”


CoT Answer for jbo_35:
Debater_B’s extra quote is misinterpreted – the text says multiple ce’u makes a relationship abstraction, not that they co‐refer. Debater_A cites the standard GOI/ko’a mechanism (Example 7.22) for linking a single variable across two events. Only choice B employs that mechanism, so B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_37:
The English means “the dog owned by the teacher is dead.” In Lojban “X pe Y” makes one sumti meaning “X associated with Y.” Thus in (A) lo ctuca pe lo gerku is the teacher associated with the dog, so cu morsi says the teacher died. In (B) lo gerku pe lo ctuca is the dog associated with the teacher, so cu morsi says the dog died. Therefore B matches the intended meaning.


CoT Answer for jbo_39:
Debater_A’s claims are backed by direct quotes: nu-abstraction must form one continuous sumti and ku is elidable when that’s true. Debater_B’s own quotes show ku is often elidable, undermining their insistence on a mandatory terminator. Therefore the correct translation omits ku: answer B.


CoT Answer for jbo_41:
Debater_A’s use of official grammar examples (<quote>Example 13.29</quote> and <quote>Example 13.41</quote>) reliably shows attitudinals must attach to the bridi, not the name, and may follow it. Debater_B’s quotes aren’t from the provided text and claim a pause rule that isn’t given. Only option B (.a’o after do kanryze’a) unambiguously gives “I hope you get better,” so B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_42:
Only Debater_A provided legitimate quotes showing that djica requires an NU…KEI abstraction for its event argument (Example 11.4). In choice B, mi djica dansu lacks NU…KEI and thus is ungrammatical if intended as “want to dance.” By contrast, A’s mi dansu djica is a valid tanru with dansu modifying djica, correctly yielding “I want to dance.”


CoT Answer for jbo_43:
We need to anchor the coast‐arrival event as the new temporal ‘now’ before saying ‘soon after.’ Only B uses ki to reset the reference base to lo nu ra darca lo xaskoi, then applies ba zi to plipe lo djacu. A simply slaps ba zi onto the event abstraction and never establishes the arrival as the reference point, misrepresenting ‘soon after X.’ Therefore B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_44:
Both sides quote legit definitions: klaku = weep/cry tears; krixa = cry out/yell. In “I could do nothing but cry” at a funeral, “cry” means shed tears, not shout. Thus klaku is the correct selbri, so choice A.


CoT Answer for jbo_45:
In Lojban, the conversion cmavo se only swaps the first two places of a selbri. Tavla’s places are x1=talker, x2=addressee, x3=topic. So se tavla makes the addressee (x2) into the x1 place of the converted selbri, yielding “that which is talked to (by us),” not “that which is talked about.” By contrast casnu has x1=discussant, x2=topic, so se casnu puts the topic into x1. Thus lo se casnu be mi’o correctly means “what we talked about,” making (B) the accurate translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_46:
“Three of the seven cats” means pick three individuals from the set of seven. In Lojban “lo” picks out individuals satisfying a predicate, so “lo ze mlatu” denotes each of the seven cats. Prefixing “ci” then selects three of those individuals: ci lo ze mlatu cu xekri = ‘three of the seven cats are black.’ By contrast, “loi ze mlatu” treats the seven cats as a single mass, so “ci loi ze mlatu” would count masses, not individual cats. Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_47:
Both sides quote valid definitions: ke’o is a vocative ‘please repeat,’ ke’u is a discursive ‘repeating–continuing.’ In English “I repeat” is a speaker’s discourse marker, not a request for the listener to repeat. Thus ke’u correctly renders “I repeat,” so B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_48:
Debater_A’s quote shows vocative COI may validly follow the bridi at sentence end. B’s structure <quote>a vocative word … can be followed by … phrases</quote> only says COI can introduce an addressee, not that it must. Moreover, ‘coi mi cnino’ would consume MI as addressee, leaving CNINO without its sumti. By contrast, ‘mi cnino coi’ cleanly expresses ‘I am new; hi.’ Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_49:
In Lojban sumti under lo, a possessor sumti (mi) must precede the predicate (blanu creka), and the numeral re immediately before the predicate scopes to ‘blue shirts.’ Thus lo mi re blanu creka = “my two blue shirts.” Placing re before mi (lo re mi blanu creka) wrongly scopes the quantifier over ‘me’ rather than ‘shirts.’


CoT Answer for jbo_50:
Neither side provided verifiable quotes in <quote> tags from an authoritative source. Debater A’s reasoning aligns with standard Lojban, where bapli’s second argument must be an event abstraction (nu do citka), not a property (ka citka). Option A correctly embeds “you eat” as an event. Therefore, A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_52:
Debater_A supplies explicit <quote> definitions for zmiku (x1 automatic in function x2) and cenba (x1 varies in property x2), directly matching ‘windows are automatic in the function of varying transparency.’ Debater_B offers only a <quote> for poi and no sourced definitions for cenba or zmiku. Only A’s quotes support the necessary structure, so A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_53:
In Lojban pluka’s x1 is the event, x2 the experiencer. In A the untagged first sumti “la .xelen.” defaults to x1, misplacing Helen as the event. B uses “fa lo ka ….” to tag the running-through-the-woods event as x1 and leaves the untagged la .xelen. as x2, correctly mapping event→x1 and Helen→x2.


CoT Answer for jbo_57:
Both sides cite Section 11.10 on tu’a, but only Debater_A also quotes the need for jai (“This is achieved…by the cmavo jai”) to properly scope the existential inside the du’u. Debater_B’s single quote defines tu’a but never explains how to avoid its loss of clarity or how to bind the quantifier without jai. Debater_A’s dual quotes directly support their analysis of B’s structure and thus B is more likely correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_61:
In Lojban na ku zo'u negates the entire bridi under it. Sentence‐linker .i ends the prenex, so in A only the paint clause is negated and the second clause (je …) is affirmative (“the wall is dirty”), which contradicts “neither … dirty.” In B, using ja inside the prenex ties both clauses under the global negation: “It’s not the case that (the paint matches the wall) or (the wall is dirty),” i.e. the paint doesn’t match and the wall isn’t dirty. Thus B matches the English “neither … nor.”


CoT Answer for jbo_63:
I only trust explicit quotes. Debater_B cited <quote>ga'a … witnessed by …</quote> showing ga'a takes an observer argument (do), matching “as you saw.” They also cited <quote>za'a … I observe</quote>, which never takes a listener argument. Thus only ga'a do su'o since mi batci correctly renders “as you saw, a snake bit me.”


CoT Answer for jbo_64:
Debater_A is the only one providing explicit quotes supporting the need for ‘pe’ as a restrictive linker (‘pe’, ‘restrictive phrase’, …). Debater_B’s key claims about bu’u ti functioning idiomatically without ‘pe’ lack any direct quotes. Since only Debater_A backs their claim with an actual quote from the text, I find A more credible.


CoT Answer for jbo_66:
Both debaters quote identical definitions: ‘be’ fixes a sumti into the x2 place of a selbri, ‘pe’ only creates a loose associative modifier. To say ‘the one I drank’ you must pin the drinker role (x2=me), which only be does. Thus lo se pinxe be mi cu kurkydu'e (A) is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_67:
The Lojban grammar quote “VUhU operators by default are done left to right” means 1+2×3 is parsed (1+2)×3=9 unless you explicitly group. The text also shows you must use vei…ve’o for non‐left‐to‐right grouping. Thus choice A yields 9=7, so only choice B with vei around “re pi’i ci” correctly encodes 1+(2×3)=7. Therefore B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_68:
Only the quoted rule ‘sumti fill places…starting with x2’ is trustworthy. In lo te ckini be X bei Y, be X fills new x2 (original object) and bei Y fills new x3 (original subject). To pick out the relation that relates Yannick (subject) to Zorro (object), we need be la .zoros. then bei la .ianik. That matches option A. Debater B’s ordering reverses subject and object and lacks supporting quotes, so A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_71:
Debater B’s use of jadni (‘adornment’) directly matches ‘nail polish’ as the decorative substance, whereas spali names the action ‘to polish,’ not the polish itself. The quoted definition of jadni fits ‘an adornment/decoration of x2,’ i.e. nail polish. Therefore lo jgalu jadni is the correct rendition.


CoT Answer for jbo_72:
Debater_A cites a valid <quote>Example 8.49</quote> showing that a sumti descriptor must be closed with ku before a higher-level connector like je can join predicates. Debater_B offers no legitimate quotes to support eliding ku in this context. Thus A’s structure is the only well-formed translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_73:
Debater_A provides two explicit quotes: “famti” has places x1=aunt/uncle, x2=nephew/niece, and “se” swaps 1st/2nd places. Debater_B’s only quote governs tanru bracketing, not gismu, and they supply no evidence that lo nu auto-swaps famti’s places. Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_75:
Debater_A’s use of <quote>‘zgipli’, ‘to play an instrument’</quote> with <quote>‘be’, default x2</quote> shows lo zgipli be lo tabra names the playing-of-the-trumpet event as x2, making the trumpet itself x1 of tatpi. Debater_B’s insertion of SE instead yields “the thing played by the trumpet,” not the trumpet. Thus A correctly says “The trumpet is tired (from being played).”


CoT Answer for jbo_76:
Both debaters agree cmene’s x1 is the name‐string and x2 is the thing named. The question is how to supply that name. Debater_A’s use of la .robert. introduces the person Robert, not the string itself. Only zo quotes the literal .robert. as required for cmene’s x1. Debater_A’s own <quote>…zo … quotes a single word…</quote> supports that, and Debater_B correctly applies it. Therefore option B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_79:
’Wine glasses’ names cups whose content is wine. In Lojban tanru the modifier precedes its head: M-H means ‘an H that is M.’ So ‘wine cup’ is vanju kabri, not kabri vanju. Preceded by su’o this yields su’o vanju kabri. Therefore the correct choice is B.


CoT Answer for jbo_80:
In Lojban tanru the last word is the head (primary concept). In “lo tunka skori,” skori (wire) is head, modified by tunka (copper), exactly matching “copper wire.” In “lo skori tunka,” tunka (copper) is head, modified by skori (wire‐like), which makes the copper primary. English “copper wire” names a wire made of copper, so the head must be wire. Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_81:
We need a selbri meaning “store‐employee” with x1=you, x2=store, and the modal pu’i before the predicate. In Lojban two adjacent predicates form a tanru (modifier+head). ‘zarci jibgu’a’ (store-employee) is a valid tanru, so in “xu do pu’i zarci jibgu’a” pu’i scopes over the tanru selbri with sumti1=do. By contrast “xu do pu’i jibgu’a zarci” makes ‘jibgu’a zarci’ a tanru (employee-store), nonsensical here. Thus B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_82:
The gismu klama’s places are x1=agent, x2=destination, x3=origin (<quote>"klama", Lojban definition: "x₁ comes/goes to destination x₂ from origin x₃…"</quote>). Untagged sumti fill slots in order (as shown by <quote>ta [cu] klama ti zo'e zo'e ta</quote> mapping ti→x2, zo'e→x3). With only one sumti after klama it fills x2, not x3. To express “from the left door” (x3) we must use the place-tag fi. Therefore A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_83:
The gismu tavla quote shows dogs must fill x3, not x2. Lojban only omits trailing zo’e; you cannot skip the 2nd place without a tag. To place lo’e gerku into the 3rd slot while leaving x2 unspecified requires fi. Hence (B) is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_84:
The place structure of FARLU is x1 falls to x2 from x3. In B the untagged LO JUBME fills the x2 slot (destination), meaning “fell to the table.” To express “from the table” without specifying a destination you must tag LO JUBME into the x3 slot using FI. Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_86:
Debater A cites two explicit quotes from the Lojban grammar showing that a poi-clause must be closed with ku’o or its selbri will merge into the main description. Debater B’s only direct quote says ku’o is elidable, but offers no counter‐example to the requirement that the relative clause be explicitly terminated. A’s evidence is stronger and directly addresses the scope issue, so A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_87:
The English sentence compares your height to that of “the cupboard with the apples.” In Lojban, “the cupboard with the apples” is lo kajnyta’e poi se nenri lo plise, a restrictive relative clause introduced by poi. That clause must be closed before specifying the property of tallness (lo ka rajycla). According to the official definition, ku’o is the terminator for restrictive (NOI) relative clauses, so you need ku’o right after lo plise to end poi… before lo ka rajycla. Sentence (B) correctly uses ku’o. Sentence (A) omits ku’o, leaving the relative clause unclosed. Therefore, B is the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_88:
The only valid quoted evidence is from Example 10.122 (“la teris. satre le mlatu .ebabo le ractu”), showing .e+ba+bo is the correct way to link two predicates in sequence. Debater A correctly applies .e ba bo to yield two sequential ‘wait’ events. Debater B offered no valid quotes to the contrary. Therefore A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_89:
Debater B supplied explicit <quote> definitions: “.e” = sumti-and, “je” = tanru-internal-and. We trust those quotes. The question asks to join two materials as a single sumti in the x₂ place of marji. According to the quoted definitions, sumti conjunction requires .e, not je. Therefore the form using lo’e mudri .e lo’e slasi is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_90:
We need to express disliking two separate objects. In Lojban, .e is the sumti‐level ‘and’ that yields two distinct arguments ‘salt’ and ‘pepper.’ By contrast, je forms a tanru predicate ‘salt-and-pepper,’ i.e. one object that is both salt and pepper. English “I dislike both salt and pepper” names two things disliked, not one hybrid. Thus A correctly uses .e to list the two sumti, so A is the right translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_91:
The English needs ∀ desk then ∃ pencil. In B, fi ro ci’ajbu tags x3 first (∀ desks) then fe su’o pinsi tags x2 (∃ pencils), exactly ∀∃ scope. Debater_A’s claim that fe must precede fi isn’t backed by any quote. Only B gives the correct ∀∃ reading.


CoT Answer for jbo_92:
The only reliable quotes are Example 16.18 (ro da … Everything sees something) and 16.19 (da ro … Something sees everything), showing that ‘ro X da’ is ∀∃ while ‘da ro X’ is ∃∀. We need ∃x∀y (∃ person who’s visited every country), so A (su’o da ro gugde pu’i stuvi’e) is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_93:
1. Only quotes in <quote>…</quote> are trusted. 2. Quoted examples show ro attaches to the first sumti to give ∀ scope, and su'o to the first sumti it precedes for ∃. 3. In A, su'o precedes ‘secret’, then tags humans, giving ∃secret ∀human (one secret for all). 4. In B, ro attaches to ‘human’ first, then su'o to ‘secret’, yielding ∀human ∃secret. 5. Thus B matches “Every human has at least one embarrassing secret.”


CoT Answer for jbo_97:
I only trust the two quotes from Debater_B, which define cpedu’s places (x2=requested item, x3=source) and explain fa/fe/fi tagging. Option B uses fi for the seller (x3) and fe for the discount (x2), matching “ask the seller for a discount.” Debater_A gave no quotes and misassigns the roles, so B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_98:
Debater_A cites authentic examples: kucli must take a du’u-clause for indirect questions (11.7–11.8), mirroring “mi djuno le du'u ma kau pu klama le zarci.” Wrapping ma kau ni glare ca lo bavlamdei in du’u is exactly how to ask “how hot.” Debater_B’s use of bare ni yields an amount abstraction, not an indirect question, so it fails to capture 'curious how.' Therefore A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_99:
The key is Lojban tanru: the rightmost selbri is the head. To express “ants are able to think,” kakne must be the head and pensi its object. In (A) xu kakne pensi…, pensi is the head (“ants think able”), which is wrong. In (B) xu pensi kakne…, kakne is the head with pensi as x2, yielding “ants can think.” Hence (B) is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_101:
We need a selbri that expresses ‘cause an event.’ <quote>gasnu</quote> is defined as ‘agentive cause of event,’ whereas <quote>zbasu</quote> means ‘assemble/build/manufacture things from components.’ Undressing is an event, not a material artifact, so gasnu is appropriate. Therefore (B) is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_103:
Debater_A’s quotes establish that in a compound bridi gi’e, tail-terms attach to both predicates only if a VAU is used to demarcate the second bridi-tail. Debater_B’s own quote (‘Every bridi-tail is terminated by an elidable VAU, but only in connection with compound bridi is it ever necessary to express this VAU’) actually confirms that explicit VAU is required here. Thus option B (with VAU) is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_104:
Debater A cites genuine background quotes on selma’o LAhE tu’a raising and forethought connectors ge…gi, showing that parallel abstracted sumti require ge…gi. Debater B’s quoted definitions look like invented dictionary snippets, not from the text. Thus A is supported by valid evidence.


CoT Answer for jbo_108:
Debater_A’s quotes show that two ce'u inside lo ka indeed creates a relationship abstraction (two variables), and that ri reliably refers back to the single ce'u variable. Debater_B’s key support uses an <invalid_quote> so can’t be trusted. Thus option A correctly gives a unary property and is the translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_109:
The sumti-link be attaches the following sumti as x2 of the selbri. In “lo nazbi be lo .ekcala cu xunre,” xunre is the selbri, its x1 is “lo nazbi be lo .ekcala” (the clown’s nose), so it means “the clown’s nose is red.” Reversing them as in A makes .ekcala the x1 of red and lo nazbi its x2, which misreads “the clown’s nose.” Thus B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_110:
Debater A is the only one citing a legitimate <quote>…</quote> from the grammar about cmavo co’a needing to precede the nu-abstraction. Debater B offers no real quotes from the text to back up the mandatory ku placement, so I discount their claim. A’s structure “co’a lo nu ra mo’u jukpa” correctly scopes the completive mo’u inside the nu-abstraction as ‘as soon as they finished cooking.’


CoT Answer for jbo_112:
Both debaters quote the same definitions for .e’a (permission) and DOI (vocative), but only Debater_A’s placement keeps the attitudinal outside the vocative, correctly attaching it to the sleeping bridi. Debater_B splits the vocative with .e’a, which misplaces the permission marker. Therefore A is the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_113:
Debater_B is the only one providing direct quotes on lo vs loi.  According to those quotes, lo picks discrete individuals while loi picks the mass/set of all such things.  “One of the couples” quantifies over the set of couples (the mass), then selects one via pa.  Hence pa loi spenysi’u cu se krasi lo morkygu’e (B) correctly matches the English.


CoT Answer for jbo_115:
Debater_A cites two explicit <quote> rules: pe’u indicates a request to the listener and a vocative may appear sentence‐final if the addressee is obvious. Debater_B only quotes the general ‘vocatives precede their argument’ rule and gives no support for dropping the sumti. Thus the evidence favors Debater_A’s position that ‘ti vajni pe’u’ is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_116:
Evaluation of quotes: Debater_A provides multiple explicit quotes from the reference stating that Lojban has no operator precedence, evaluates VUhU operators strictly left-to-right, and requires vei/ve’o for grouping (with ve’o optional at the end). This exactly matches why we need vei to keep 1/5 together. Debater_B’s single quote merely describes a non-official convention of relying on semantics—but the core rule is that parsing ignores semantics, so without vei the expression means (2+1)/5, not 2+(1/5). Therefore choice A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_117:
1. The gismu djica requires its x2 to be an event/state (<quote>x₁ desires/wants x₂ (event/state)…</quote>). 2. Option A uses ka-abstraction, yielding a property, not an event. 3. Option B correctly uses nu-abstraction to package “the door’s being on the east side” as a state/event. 4. Debater_B’s quoted definitions are valid and directly support nu. 5. Therefore the only well-formed translation satisfying djica’s x2 requirement is B.


CoT Answer for jbo_118:
English uses quotation marks to mention the words “pot” and “cup,” so in Lojban we must quote those words with zo (single-word quote), not use lo (refer to real objects). Debater_A’s quotes about zo vs lo are legitimate and align with this meta-linguistic reading. Therefore option A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_119:
The quoted definition <quote>birti: x₁ is certain/sure/positive/convinced that x₂ is true.</quote> requires x₂ to be a proposition, not just a noun phrase. Only option B wraps “how heavy the couch is” as a proposition with <quote>le du'u ma kau junta lo sfofa</quote>. A’s <quote>lo junta be lo sfofa</quote> names a weight but doesn’t assert a bridi, so it fails to satisfy birti’s requirement.


CoT Answer for jbo_120:
In Lojban “no prenu” = exactly 0 persons. 
• “no prenu cu prane” says “zero persons are perfect” → matches “nobody is perfect.”
• “no prenu na prane” says “zero persons are not perfect” → implies everyone is perfect.  
Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_123:
In Lojban ra’u is a discursive modifier that, when intended to qualify a sumti, must appear inside that sumti before ku. Option B, “lo’e pacna ra’u ku fliba ta’e,” correctly places ra’u inside the pacna‐sumti, giving “those who mainly hope.” The ku then ends the sumti and fliba ta’e renders “fail usually.” In A, ra’u comes after ku and thus wrongly attaches to fliba rather than to pacna.
