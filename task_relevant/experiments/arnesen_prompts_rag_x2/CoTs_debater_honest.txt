CoT Answer for jbo_1:
1. The English “I think we need to hurry up” is a speech act expressing an opinion about a proposition, not merely an internal reflection.  
2. The background defines pensi as an internal, topic-focused cogitation: <quote>“pensi: x₁ thinks/considers/cogitates/reasons/is pensive about subject/concept x₂”</quote>. This makes pensi the wrong choice for stating an external opinion.  
3. By contrast, jinvi is specifically the gismu for voicing an opinion on a predication: <quote>“jinvi: x₁ thinks/opines x₂ [opinion] (du’u) is true about subject/issue x₃ on grounds x₄”</quote>. It directly licenses a du’u clause.  
4. Therefore, to translate “I think [that] we need to hurry” we must use jinvi with a du’u abstraction over mi’a nitcu lo ka sutryze’a.  
5. Debater_B’s choice (A) wrongly uses pensi, which implies personal rumination rather than an expressed belief.  Hence the correct Lojban is B: mi jinvi lo du’u mi’a nitcu lo ka sutryze’a.


CoT Answer for jbo_2:
1. In Lojban tanru (compound predicates) are head-final: the left brivla modifies the right brivla. As the grammar explains, “blabi karce, like all tanru, … the first element modifies the second.” <quote>However, blabi karce, like all tanru, is somewhat vague: in principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things, or even express some more complicated concept involving whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative clause of Example 8.16 can only refer to a car which is white, not to any more complex or extended concept.</quote>  

2. Applying that to “apple tea,” we need the modifier “plise” before the head “tcati.” The dictionary entries confirm these senses:  
<quote>{'Lojban': 'plise', 'Lojban definition': 'x₁ is an apple [fruit] of species/strain x₂.'}</quote>  
<quote>{'Lojban': 'tcati', 'Lojban definition': 'x₁ is made of/contains/is a quantity of tea brewed from leaves x₂.'}</quote>  
Thus “plise tcati” means “tea of apple,” i.e. apple tea.  

3. Debater_B’s proposed translation “lo tcati plise ku xu” inverts that order, yielding “an apple of tea,” a “tea‐apple,” which does not convey “apple tea.” As a result, (B) misplaces modifier and head.  

4. Therefore the correct translation is (A) “do pinxe lo plise tcati ku xu,” literally “Did you drink the apple-tea?”


CoT Answer for jbo_3:
1. The gismu “finti” has the place structure “x1 invents x2 for function/purpose x3 from existing elements x4.”  <quote>x1 invents/creates/composes/authors x2 for function/purpose x3 from existing elements x4.</quote>
2. In “se finti,” the x1 and x2 places swap, so the picture fills x1 and the omitted maker would be x2; the purpose remains x3.
3. Lojban uses the cmavo “fi” to explicitly tag the 3rd sumti place.  <quote>fi: 3rd sumti place tag</quote>
4. Because we omit the maker (x2), we must still supply the purpose (x3) and mark it with “fi.” Without “fi,” the parser would assume the next sumti is x2, producing the wrong meaning.
5. Choice B, “lo pixra cu se finti fi lo ka jai spaji lo vitke,” correctly marks the purpose as the 3rd place. Choice A omits “fi” and thus mis-assigns the argument. Therefore the correct translation is B.


CoT Answer for jbo_4:
1. The English sentence “Put the books on the table into your bag” requires that the relative clause “on the table” (cpana lo jubme) modify lo cukta, and then that lo dakli pe do (your bag) be the destination.  
2. In Lojban, a restrictive relative clause introduced by poi must be closed with ku'o (the elidable relative‐clause terminator), not with ku (which merely ends a sumti).  
   • Section 8.1 explains this: <quote>A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable terminator __ku'o__</quote>.  
   • The index of relative‐clause cmavo confirms: <quote>__ku'o__ — relative clause elidable terminator</quote>.  
3. Answer A correctly writes:  
   ko punji  
     lo cukta  
       poi cpana lo jubme ku'o   ⟵ closes the “on the table” clause  
     lo dakli pe do            ⟵ into your bag  
4. By contrast, B uses ku instead of ku'o:  
   ko punji lo cukta poi cpana lo jubme ku lo dakli pe do  
Here, ku closes only the descriptor _lo jubme ku_, so “lo dakli pe do” falls inside the open relative clause started by poi, making the sentence nonsensical.  
5. Therefore the correct translation is A, which properly closes the relative clause before specifying the bag.


CoT Answer for jbo_5:
1. The sentence “Our restaurant is popular with Mexicans, Serbs and Indians” means it is popular separately with each of those three groups, not that there is one group of people who are simultaneously Mexican, Serbian, and Indian.  
2. Option A uses “je” inside the sumti <invalid_quote>lo mexno je serbo je xindo</invalid_quote>, which is a tanru-internal connector.  From the background: <quote>je ... Definition: “logical connective: tanru-internal afterthought and”</quote>.  This forces the interpretation “people who are both Mexican and Serbian and Indian” as a single group.  
3. By contrast, Option B uses “.e” to connect separate sumti: <invalid_quote>lo mexno .e lo serbo .e lo xindo</invalid_quote>.  The background defines “.e” as <quote>Definition: “logical connective: sumti afterthought and”</quote>.  This correctly expresses three distinct arguments to the predicate, meaning “popular with Mexicans, and popular with Serbs, and popular with Indians.”  
4. Therefore, the proper Lojban translation is B (“lo gusta pe mi'a lo mexno .e lo serbo .e lo xindo ta'e se vitke”).


CoT Answer for jbo_6:
1. The English sentence “She gave a copy to everyone that came by” means “for each passerby, there exists (at least) one copy that she gave to that person.” In logical terms we require a universal quantifier (everyone) *before* the existential quantifier (a copy).  

2. Option B (ra dunda su'o fukpi ro lamgre) places the existential quantifier __su'o fukpi__ before the universal __ro lamgre__.  By analogy to Example 16.19 in the background, where <quote>da ro de zo'u da viska de</quote> (“Something sees everything”) shows that an existential before a universal yields the meaning “there exists one thing that relates to every Y,” B would mean “There is some single copy that she gave to all passersby,” clearly not the intended meaning.  

3. Option A (ra dunda fi ro lamgre fe su'o fukpi) explicitly tags __ro lamgre__ as x3 (recipients) and __su'o fukpi__ as x2 (gifts), ensuring the universal comes *first* and the existential *second*.  This corresponds to “for every passerby (ro lamgre) there is at least one copy (su'o fukpi) that was given to them,” exactly matching the English.  

4. The background’s treatment of quantifiers confirms that the order matters: universal quantifiers appear at the front (Example 16.17: <quote>ro da ro de zo'u da prami de</quote>), while existential ones are introduced later (Example 6.32: <quote>mi ponse su'o ci cutci</quote>).  

5. Debater_B’s defense of B ignores this scope distinction and misapplies default sumti order.  Without explicit FA tags, B’s __su'o__ still scopes over the universal, whereas A’s tagged form correctly scopes the universal over the existential.  

Therefore the only correct Lojban translation is A.


CoT Answer for jbo_7:
1. In Lojban grammar, every bridi (predicate sentence) consists of one or more sumti (arguments) followed by a selbri (predicate).  
2. The cmavo “cu” is the standard marker that separates the preceding sumti from the following selbri. As stated in the definitions, <quote>“cu … elidable marker: separates selbri from preceding sumti”</quote>.  
3. In sentence (A) “.ei lo grasu gacri lo palne”, there is no “cu” before “gacri”, so “lo grasu gacri” is forced to parse as a single, compound sumti rather than treating “gacri” as the selbri. That leaves the bridi without a main predicate, which is ungrammatical.  
4. In contrast, (B) “.ei lo grasu cu gacri lo palne” correctly uses “cu” to mark “gacri” as the selbri: “The oil (lo grasu) —[cu]— should cover (gacri) the pan (lo palne).”  
5. Thus, only (B) provides the necessary selbri separator and yields a valid Lojban bridi matching “The oil should cover the pan.”


CoT Answer for jbo_8:
The gismu <quote>nupre</quote> has the place structure “x1 promises x2 to x3” – agent, event/state, beneficiary. In our sentence “I promise you I won’t eat any of the meat,” we have:
  • x1 = mi (I)  
  • x2 = lo ka citka no lo rectu (the event of not eating any of the meat)  
  • x3 = do (you)

Without explicit tags, Lojban would assign the second sumti to x2 and the third to x3 by position. In choice B, <quote>mi do nupre lo ka citka no lo rectu</quote> parses as x1=mi, x2=do, x3=lo ka citka no lo rectu, which reverses the event and beneficiary. That is incorrect.

To swap the order, we must use place‐structure tags. From the background:
<quote>fi … tags x3 place</quote>
<quote>fe … tags x2 place</quote>
By writing “mi fi do nupre fe lo ka citka no lo rectu” (choice A), we explicitly place “do” in x3 and “lo ka citka no lo rectu” in x2, matching the intended roles. Hence A is the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_9:
1. The predicate djuno (to know) requires as its second argument a fact or predication, not a bare noun. 2. Background Section 11.7 explains that "djuno" must take a du’u-abstracting sumti to express the proposition known: <quote>mi djuno le du'u la frank. cu bebna kei</quote>. 3. Section 11.8 shows how to form an indirect question under djuno by wrapping the questioned sumti with le du’u … kau, e.g.: <quote>mi djuno le du'u ma kau pu klama le zarci</quote>. 4. Option A, “xu do djuno lo jdima be lo nanba”, uses a description “lo jdima be lo nanba” (“the price of the bread”) as though djuno could directly know that noun, but djuno semantically knows a proposition, not an object. 5. By contrast, Option B, “xu do djuno lo du'u ma kau jdima lo nanba”, correctly abstracts the question “what is the price of the bread” into a predication with du’u and kau, satisfying djuno’s requirement for a propositional argument. Therefore the correct translation is B.


CoT Answer for jbo_10:
1. The English "It might rain tomorrow." has three components: the predicate carvi (to rain), the modal possibility cumki, and the time lo bavlamdei ("tomorrow").  
2. In modal conversion (selmaʻo JAI), we swap the x1 place of the main predicate with its modal place by inserting jai before the modal word and marking the old x1 with fai.  As explained:  
   <quote>“To exchange these two, we use a modal conversion operator consisting of jai (of selmaʻo JAI) followed by the modal cmavo. … Example 9.83: la lojban jai bau cusku fai mi.”</quote>  
3. By analogy, for “rain” and “possible” we need carvi as the selbri, then jai cumki, and finally tag the x1 place with fa before lo bavlamdei.  This yields “carvi jai cumki fa lo bavlamdei.”  
4. Debater_B’s formula “jai cumki carvi fa lo bavlamdei” instead makes the compound predicate jai cumki carvi, treating cumki as the modificand.  That violates the JAI‐modal pattern (predicand → modal → swap) and results in a nonsensical tanru rather than “It might rain tomorrow.”  
5. Therefore, the correct standard Lojban translation is A: carvi jai cumki fa lo bavlamdei.


CoT Answer for jbo_11:
We first note that the gismu <quote>x₁ satisfies evaluator x₂ in property (ka)/state x₃.</quote> tells us that in “mansa x₁ x₂ x₃”, x₂ must be the evaluator (“me”). Thus “mi” must occupy the x₂ place.  Under Lojban default ordering, the first sumti after the selbri is x₁ and the second is x₂.  Option B correctly swaps these by tagging “lo nu ma kai ni glare” as x₁, allowing the bare “mi” to fill x₂.  In contrast, Option A uses <quote>fa mi</quote>, forcing “mi” into x₁ and misplacing the evaluator.  

Moreover, Option B uses the cmavo <quote>kai</quote>, which is the proper modal for characterizing a property ("how hot it is").  By contrast, Option A employs <quote>kau</quote>, which specifically “marks a word serving as the focus of an indirect question,” not a descriptive property.  In other words, <quote>kau</quote> would turn “how hot it is” into a question rather than a state.  Therefore, Option B (“mansa mi fa lo nu ma kai ni glare”) is the only translation that both places “mi” in the evaluator slot and uses the correct property‐characterizing cmavo.


CoT Answer for jbo_12:
1. The English sentence describes a state change: the tomato becoming red over one day. In Lojban, we must abstract the event of a change of property using the event abstractor “nu”.  
2. We then need to mark the beginning of the change (the tomato starting to turn red) with the ZAhO cmavo “co’a”, which means “initiative”. As shown in the event-contours section: <quote>co'a | ZAhO | initiative</quote>.  
3. The predicate must be “xunre” (to be red), not a movement verb. The gismu “xunre” is defined as: <quote>x_{1} is red/crimson/ruddy [color adjective].</quote>  
4. Debater_B’s proposal uses the tanru “xunre carna”, but “carna” is about physical rotation: <quote>x_1 turns about vector x_2 towards direction x_3, turning angular distance / to face point x_4</quote>. This does not express a color-change process and thus misstates the meaning.  
5. The correct structure is:  
   • lo nu lo tamca co'a xunre  — the event of the tomato beginning to be red,  
   • djedi li pa fa …        — one day is the measure of (x1 place tag) that event.  
Therefore, (A) “djedi li pa fa lo nu lo tamca co'a xunre” correctly captures “The tomato took a day to turn red,” while (B) fails by using “carna” for rotation rather than indicating state change.


CoT Answer for jbo_13:
1. The English sentence means “the event of causing (by many workers leaving) is probable.” In Lojban, gismu <quote>lakne</quote> has the definition <quote>x1 (event/state/property) is probable/likely under conditions x2</quote>. To express “an event is likely,” the event must be the x1 sumti of <quote>lakne</quote>, e.g. <quote>lo nu R cu lakne</quote> = “the event R is likely.”  

2. In option B, we have “lo nu rinka fa lo nu so’i lo gunka cu cliva cu lakne.” Here the selbri of the main bridi is <quote>lakne</quote>, with x1 = <quote>lo nu rinka fa lo nu so’i lo gunka cu cliva</quote> (the event of “many workers leaving causes…”). Thus it literally says “the event of causing is likely,” exactly matching “a likely cause is that many of the workers left.”  

3. By contrast, option A starts with the tanru <quote>lakne rinka</quote>, where <quote>lakne</quote> (seltau) modifies <quote>rinka</quote> (tertau). In Lojban tanru structure, the rightmost gismu (<quote>rinka</quote>) remains the main predicate, so option A asserts “it causes” and merely qualifies that causing as ‘likely.’ That reverses the intended hierarchy: we want to state that the causing event is likely, not that something likely causes the leaving.  

4. Therefore only B correctly places <quote>lakne</quote> as the main selbri with the causing event as its argument, giving the intended meaning “a likely cause is that many of the workers left.”


CoT Answer for jbo_14:
1. The English “We all sang together” requires simply stating that the speaker’s group (excluding the listener) performed the act of singing as a group. In Lojban, mi’a denotes exactly that group. <quote>mi’a: I and others, we but not you</quote>  
2. The lujvo kansi’u means “x1 do x2 together”, so placing mi’a as x1 and lo ka sanga (the property of singing) as x2 yields “we sang together”. <quote>kansi’u: x1 do x2 together</quote>  
3. By contrast, ro is a universal quantifier that only attaches to variable cmavo like da/de, not to prosumti such as mi’a. In fact: <quote>When the variable cmavo __da__ is preceded by __ro__, the combination means “For every X”</quote>. Prepending ro to mi’a would be ungrammatical and would force a nonsensical reading (“for every we…”).  
4. Therefore the correct translation is A: mi’a kansi’u lo ka sanga.


CoT Answer for jbo_15:
We need to express “two kilograms of flour” in Lojban by describing flour items whose mass is two kilograms. The predicate ki’ogra has place structure x1 = object, x2 = mass in kilograms.  

First, note that the cmavo <quote>ki’ogra means “x1 is x2 kilograms in mass by standard g.”</quote> Therefore to say “flour weighs two kilograms,” we want something like “flour such that ki’ogra li re.”  

Second, the cmavo <quote>be is a sumti link to attach a sumti (default x2) to a selbri; used in descriptions</quote>.  In option A, “re ki’ogra be lo grupu’o” attaches “flour” into the x2 place of ki’ogra, yielding “two things that weigh flour kilograms,” which is nonsensical.  

By contrast, option B uses a restrictive clause: “su’o grupu’o poi ki’ogra li re” means “at least one flour such that it weighs two kilograms.”  Here su’o = “at least,” grupu’o = “flour,” poi = “restrictive clause,” ki’ogra = “weighs x kilograms,” and li re = “the number two.”  Together they correctly express “flour weighing two kilograms.”  

Finally, ra nitcu tu’a introduces “He needs the bridi implied by …,” so the full B translation, <quote>ra nitcu tu’a su’o grupu’o poi ki’ogra li re</quote>, literally means “He needs some flour that weighs two kilograms,” exactly matching the English sentence.  Option A fails because it misuses be to attach flour as a kilogram-unit rather than weighing the flour itself.


CoT Answer for jbo_16:
1. In Lojban compound bridi, tail-terms (like “for stealing the books”) must follow a bridi-tail terminated by <quote>vau</quote> so they apply to all connected bridi-tails.  
   Evidence: <quote>“The __vau__ … serves to separate the bridi-tail from the tail-terms. Every bridi-tail is terminated by an elidable __vau__, but only in connection with compound bridi is it ever necessary to express this __vau__.”</quote> (Example 14.54)

2. Translation (A) correctly places <quote>vau</quote> before <quote>lo ka zerle'a lo cukta</quote>, making “for stealing the books” a tail-term shared by both <quote>sfasa</quote> (punish) and <quote>fraxu</quote> (forgive).  

3. By contrast, (B) omits <quote>vau</quote>, so <quote>lo ka zerle'a lo cukta</quote> attaches only to the inner bridi-tail <quote>fraxu</quote>. That renders “for stealing the books” only as the reason for forgiveness, not for punishment, misrepresenting the English: “They punished but then forgave you for stealing the books.”

4. Therefore (A) is the unique correct translation, since it uses <quote>vau</quote> to enclose the bridi-tail properly so that the abstraction <quote>lo ka zerle'a lo cukta</quote> applies to both punish and forgive.


CoT Answer for jbo_17:
The English says “It’s Sunday, so the stores are closed and we have to be quiet.” Logically, both “stores are closed” and “we must be quiet” are results of it being Sunday.  

1. In (A), the result connective uses just “ja’e bo”, where <quote>“the cmavo bo … has high precedence and short scope; connections marked with bo are interpreted before connections not so marked.”</quote> This means that only the first clause “lo zarci na .akti” is bound tightly to ja’e, while the second clause ends up outside that result grouping and is merely joined by an ordinary je “and.” Thus (A) yields “It’s Sunday, therefore stores are closed, and also we must be quiet,” implying the second clause is not a result phrase.  

2. In (B), we replace the tight-scope bo with a grouping parenthesis opener <quote>“tu’e … tu'u … set off the structure”</quote> so that both clauses up to the corresponding tu'u are included in the scope of ja’e. The .i ja’e bo tu’e starts a result group, and later .i je closes it so that both “lo zarci na .akti” AND “ma’a lo ka smaji cu bilga” are uniformly treated as consequences of “zeldei.”  

3. Therefore only (B) faithfully matches the English meaning that both stores closing and our needing quiet are results of it being Sunday, whereas (A) treats only the first clause as a result.


CoT Answer for jbo_18:
1. In Lojban, sumti connection uses an afterthought connective of selmaʻo A, such as “.e” to join two sumti before a single selbri. As the grammar states, “Any ek may be used between sumti” to express “and” or other logical relations between two arguments of the same predicate.<quote>“Any ek may be used between sumti, even if there is no direct English equivalent.”</quote>

2. To render “but not China,” we must negate the second sumti (China) rather than the first. Lojban negates individual cmavo or words by attaching the cmavo “nai,” which literally “negates last word.”<quote>“English: negate last word”</quote>

3. Thus the correct pattern for “Russia and not China” as the x2 of “pu’i klama” is:
   lo ruskygu'e .e nai lo jungygu'e
   where “.e” = “and,” and “nai” immediately before “lo jungygu'e” negates “China.”

4. In contrast, Debater_B’s choice (B) writes:
   mi lo ruskygu'e na .e lo jungygu'e pu'i klama
   Here “na” is a bridi negator, which by the rules “attaches to the beginning of the selbri” to negate the entire bridi, not an individual sumti. <quote>“A bridi may have the particle ‘na’ … attached to the beginning of the selbri to negate the bridi.”</quote>  That placement wrongly negates either the whole going‐to relation or ends up negating “Russia” (the first branch), giving the opposite meaning (“I have not been to Russia but have been to China”).

5. Furthermore, negation cmavo like “na” cannot be embedded inside a sumti or before an ek; they only appear at the selbri level. <quote>“Tense, modal, and negation cmavo can appear only at the beginning of the selbri. They cannot be embedded within it.”</quote>

6. Therefore, answer A (mi lo ruskygu'e .e nai lo jungygu'e pu'i klama) correctly means “I have been to Russia but not to China,” while B misplaces “na” and expresses the opposite or becomes ungrammatical.


CoT Answer for jbo_19:
1. In Lojban, nabmi fa X means “X is the problem” with X in the x2 place of nabmi. 2. The English sentence “The problem is with the rope and not the wheel” conjoins two raised abstractions: the rope-event and the wheel-event. 3. To raise any sumti into an abstraction context we must use <quote>tu'a</quote>: <quote>“extracts a concrete sumti from an unspecified abstraction; equivalent to le nu/su'u [sumti] co'e”</quote>. Both rope and wheel must be wrapped in tu'a. 4. Choice (A) uses “.e nai lo xislu”, where <quote>.e</quote> is the afterthought connector (“and”) and <quote>nai</quote> merely negates the last word: <quote>“negate last word”</quote>. That attaches “not” only to lo xislu, without raising the wheel into the same abstraction domain. 5. Forethought logical connection—the correct way to conjoin two tu'a-phrases—is done with <quote>ge … gi</quote>: <quote>“ge”: “logical connective: forethought … and (with gi)”</quote>. 6. Thus (B) nabmi fa ge tu'a lo skori gi nai tu'a lo xislu correctly says “It is a problem both (the rope-event) and not (the wheel-event).” 7. By raising both sumti and using forethought ge…gi with nai on the second tu'a, (B) faithfully matches the English meaning, whereas (A) fails to raise the wheel event and misuses afterthought .e nai.


CoT Answer for jbo_20:
First, note the relevant word definitions in Lojban: <quote>'su'o', ... 'English': 'at least', 'Definition': 'digit/number: at least (some)'</quote>; <quote>'ba'o', ... 'English': 'perfective'</quote>; <quote>'morji', ... 'English': '- remember'</quote>; and <quote>'vajni', ... 'English': '- important'</quote>. In Lojban, quantifiers like <quote>su'o</quote> attach to the very next sumti, and aspect markers like <quote>ba'o</quote> apply to the selbri that follows. By default, operators scope from left to right. For sentence (A) “mi su'o vajni ba'o morji,” the quantifier <quote>su'o vajni</quote> (“at least one important thing”) scopes over the perfective selbri <quote>ba'o morji</quote> (“have finished remembering”). The natural reading is “There is at least one important thing that I once remembered (but now don’t),” i.e. “There is something important that I no longer remember,” which matches the English “I’ve forgotten something important.” By contrast, in (B) “mi ba'o morji su'o vajni,” <quote>ba'o morji</quote> (“I once remembered”) takes scope before the quantifier <quote>su'o vajni</quote>, yielding “I have remembered at least one important thing,” or even “I remembered something important,” the opposite of forgetting. Therefore (A) correctly captures “I’ve forgotten something important,” while (B) does not.


CoT Answer for jbo_21:
None


CoT Answer for jbo_22:
1. The English sentence “I am convinced of only one thing, namely that I love you” presents “that I love you” as a parenthetical clarification (“namely”), not as a defining restriction on what the one thing is.  
2. In Lojban, 'pa da' expresses “exactly one thing.” We then attach a relative clause to 'da' to specify its content.  
3. Background text: 'poi' is a restrictive relative clause, 'noi' is an incidental (non-restrictive) clause.  
   <quote>'poi' ... Definition: 'restrictive relative clause; attaches subordinate bridi with identifying information to a sumti'</quote>
   <quote>'noi' ... Definition: 'incidental clause; attaches subordinate bridi with incidental information'</quote>
4. Because the English uses “namely” as a side-note, we need an incidental clause marker 'noi' to match the parenthetical sense. Using 'poi' would embed the proposition inside the quantifier, forcing the structure “the one thing that I am convinced of and which is ‘I love you’,” which over-restricts and misplaces the emphasis.  
5. Thus the faithful translation is:
   mi birti pa da noi du'u mi do prami
   (A)
6. Debater_B’s choice (B) uses 'poi' and so makes the relative clause restrictive, conflating the quantifier's scope with the proposition and losing the 'namely' parenthetical nuance. Therefore B misrepresents the English meaning.


CoT Answer for jbo_23:
To correctly express “intended to go west but instead went north,” the inner abstraction started by <quote>ka</quote> must be closed before the top‐level connector <quote>gi'e</quote> is applied.  

1. The property abstraction <quote>ka</quote> requires an explicit terminator <quote>kei</quote> to end its scope.  As the background explains, <quote>the cmavo 'ka' is an abstractor: property/quality abstractor (-ness); x1 is quality/property exhibited by [bridi]</quote> and <quote>'kei' is an elidable terminator: end abstraction bridi (often elidable)</quote>.  Without closing <quote>ka</quote> with <quote>kei</quote>, any following structure remains inside that abstraction.  

2. In (A), the first <quote>vau</quote> ends only a simple bridi‐tail, not the <quote>ka</quote> abstraction.  Consequently the <quote>gi'e</quote> falls inside the abstraction, yielding the nonsensical reading “the tourist wanted (go west and instead go north).”  By contrast, (B) writes <quote>lo ka klama lo stici kei</quote>, so that <quote>kei</quote> closes the intended “go west” sub‐bridi.  

3. Only after that <quote>kei</quote> is the connector <quote>gi'e</quote> free to join the main bridi tails at the top level, correctly meaning “but instead went north.”  As noted, <quote>gi'e is the gihek corresponding to 'and,' used in afterthought to create compound bridi</quote>.  

Thus (B) places <quote>kei</quote> before <quote>gi'e</quote>, giving the intended scope and is the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_24:
1. The gismu <quote>punji</quote> has three places: x1 is the agent, x2 is the object, and x3 is the surface or locus on which the object is placed. In Lojban, you must supply exactly two sumti (x2 and x3) after the agent <quote>do</quote> for each "put" action.  
2. Choice B uses <quote>.e</quote>, which is a "sumti afterthought and" (i.e., it connects sumti, not entire bridi). Here B’s structure is: punji lo kunti botpi fi lo fesybaktu .e lo culno botpi fi lo jubme. This makes <quote>lo culno botpi</quote> merely a second sumti linked to <quote>lo fesybaktu</quote> as if both were filling punji’s x3 place, rather than a separate "put" action.  
3. By contrast, choice A surrounds two complete punji actions with the forethought connective pair <quote>ge ... gi</quote> ("both—and"):  
   • The first half is "punji lo kunti botpi lo fesybaktu" (put the empty bottle in the bin).  
   • The second half is "punji lo culno botpi lo jubme" (put the full bottle on the table).  
   The marker <quote>ge</quote> before the first action means "both" and <quote>gi</quote> between them means "and," correctly linking two whole bridi.  
4. Thus A faithfully captures “put empty bottle in bin and full bottle on table,” while B misapplies <quote>.e</quote> as a sumti connector, failing to form two distinct actions.


CoT Answer for jbo_25:
We need to negate "I go outside" and then separately give a causal sentence. In (A) the causal <quote>ki'u lo nu carvi</quote> remains inside the same bridi as the negation <quote>na klama lo bartu ki'u lo nu carvi</quote>, so the negator scopes over the reason, yielding “It is not true that I go outside because it was raining.” That contradicts the intended meaning. By contrast, (B) uses a sentence-separator <quote>.i</quote> plus an afterthought connective marked with <quote>bo</quote>, so the causal clause is its own bridi outside the scope of <quote>na</quote>. As explained in the grammar, “the compound cmavo _.iri'abo_ and _.iseri'abo_ serve to connect two bridi, as the initial .i indicates. The final bo is necessary to prevent the modal from ‘taking over’ the following sumti.” (Example 9.41) Moreover, “connections marked with bo are interpreted before connections not so marked.” (Section 14.8) Hence (B) correctly yields “I didn’t go outside. The reason is that it was raining.”


CoT Answer for jbo_26:
We need to express “The Hajj happens once a year in Mecca” in precise Lojban.  First, the main predicate “happens” is the gismu fasnu: <quote>x₁ is an event that happens/occurs/takes place</quote>.  The timing “once a year” is pa roi ro nanca, where roi is the quantified‐tense modifier: <quote>converts number to an objectively quantified tense interval modifier; defaults to time tense</quote>, and nanca is “year”: <quote>x₁ is x₂ years in duration</quote>.  That leaves the location “in Mecca.”  There are two possible locative cmavo: bu’u and ne’i.  bu’u means “coincident with/at the same place as; space equivalent of ca” <quote>coincident with/at the same place as; space equivalent of ca</quote>.  ne’i means “within/inside of/into ...” <quote>within/inside of/into ...</quote>.  Mecca is treated as a geographic location, not an enclosed container, so the correct locative is bu’u.  Using ne’i would wrongly imply an enclosed space (e.g. “inside a room”).  Therefore the correct translation is: la .xadj. cu fasnu pa roi ro nanca bu’u la .makax., choice A.


CoT Answer for jbo_27:
We must choose B because in Lojban pro-sumti anaphora, ri refers to the immediately preceding sumti (the last sumti), while ru reaches back to an earlier one:

1. The question sentence is “The lake is full of people. I was swimming there yesterday.” The second sentence uses “there” to refer to the lake (lo lalxu).

2. Option A uses “ri” in “mi ri limna”, so “ri” picks up the last-completed sumti before it. In:
   lo lalxu ca culno lo'e remna .i mi ri limna…
   the last sumti is <quote>lo'e remna</quote> (“the people”), not the lake. So A would mean “I swam in the people yesterday,” which is clearly not intended.

   <quote>ri ... repeats last sumti</quote>

3. Option B uses “ru” in “mi ru limna”. The cmavo “ru” refers to a more remote antecedent sumti, skipping the immediately previous one (lo'e remna) and landing on lo lalxu (the lake). Thus B correctly yields “I was swimming in the lake yesterday.”

   <quote>ru ... repeats long-ago sumti</quote>

Therefore only (B) renders the English meaning accurately in standard Lojban.


CoT Answer for jbo_28:
1. In Lojban, the particle <quote>co</quote> performs tanru inversion: it makes the word before it the tertau and the word after it the seltau, and any sumti following the selbri fill the places of the seltau (not the tertau).  <quote>In tanru inversion, the element before co is the tertau, and the element following co is the seltau… any sumti which follow that selbri actually fill the places (starting with x2) of the seltau.</quote>

2. The English "Try to cut the melon" requires that the listener (x1 of <quote>troci</quote>) attempt the action of cutting, with <quote>lo guzme</quote> filling the x2 place of <quote>katna</quote> (the object being cut).  This map of roles is exactly achieved by “ko troci co katna lo guzme”: <quote>mi troci co klama le zarci le zdani</quote> shows the pattern for “try to go to the market,” likewise “ko troci co katna lo guzme” means “You, try to cut the melon.”

3. In contrast, B (“ko katna troci lo guzme”) lacks <quote>co</quote> and thus is not inverted.  Without inversion, <quote>lo guzme</quote> would fill the x2 place of <quote>troci</quote>, making the melon an event/state rather than the object being cut—this is semantically and syntactically nonsensical.  Because B misassigns the roles, only A correctly captures “try to cut the melon.”


CoT Answer for jbo_29:
1. The cmavo ka introduces a property or event abstraction, and such abstractions must be closed with the abstraction terminator kei, not with the sumti terminator ku.  
   Evidence: <quote>{'Lojban': 'kei', 'Definition': 'elidable terminator: end abstraction bridi (often elidable)'}</quote>  
2. In option A, the use of ku (<quote>{'Lojban': 'ku', 'Definition': 'elidable terminator: end description, modal, or negator sumti; often elidable'}</quote>) only ends a description sumti, not the abstraction started by ka.  This leaves the abstraction open, causing “do” to be parsed inside the ka‐abstraction (as a third argument of sazri) and “pluka” outside any valid main predicate.  
3. Option B correctly uses kei to close the ka‐abstraction before “do pluka” so that “do pluka” functions as the main predicate (“you enjoy”).  The structure becomes:  
   xu (question)  
   [lo ka sazri lo'e relxima kei]  
   do pluka  
   “Is the property of enjoying riding a bike what you please?”  
4. Therefore, only B yields a well-formed Lojban sentence that matches the English “Do you enjoy riding a bike?”


CoT Answer for jbo_30:
We need an inclusive “we” (“let’s”) that invites the listener to join.  The cmavo <quote>mi'o includes only the speaker and the listener but no one else</quote>, exactly matching English “let’s” when you say “Let’s watch the sunset.”  By contrast, <quote>mi'a includes the speaker and others but excludes the listener</quote>, which would wrongly leave you out.  The word <quote>.e'u</quote> is the standard Lojban suggestion marker (“let’s ...”).  Finally, <quote>zgana</quote> means “observe/watch,” and <quote>solnuncanci</quote> means “sunset.”  Putting these together, .e'u mi'o zgana lo solnuncanci literally means “Suggestion: we (you and I) watch the sunset,” precisely “Let’s watch the sunset.”  Therefore A is correct and B is incorrect.


CoT Answer for jbo_31:
1. The English sentence “Only the red ones are sweet” requires us to restrict the sweetness predicate (titla), not the redness descriptor (xunre).  
2. In Lojban, po'o must follow and modify exactly the element it restricts.  
   • The background defines po'o as <quote>discursive: uniquely, only, solely: the only relevant case</quote>.  
   • It also warns: <quote>Note that “only” can go before or after what it modifies in English, but po'o, as an indicator, always comes afterward.</quote>  
3. In choice (A) “lo xunre po'o ku titla”, po'o comes immediately after xunre, so it restricts the descriptor “red” itself—meaning “those which are only red.” This shifts the focus incorrectly to redness rather than to sweetness.  
4. By contrast, in (B) “lo xunre ku po'o titla”, the terminator ku ends the descriptor sumti <quote>'ku': end sumti</quote>, and po'o then directly precedes titla, restricting the selbri “sweet.” In other words, it correctly expresses “only those that are red are sweet.”  
5. Therefore, the proper translation is (B) lo xunre ku po'o titla.


CoT Answer for jbo_32:
1. The English sentence “The children were too lazy to do what they were imagining” refers to the children’s own act of imagining something. In Lojban, we capture “they were imagining” with the selbri <quote>xanri</quote>, whose place structure is: x1 = the thing imagined, x2 = the person imagining it.  

2. We attach the sumti variable for “they” by using <quote>be</quote>, which “links a sumti (default x2) to a selbri” (Definition of <quote>be</quote>: “sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri; used in descriptions”). Thus <quote>xanri be ri</quote> means “the thing imagined by them.”  

3. Answer A, <quote>lo verba cu lazni lo ka gasnu lo xanri be ri</quote>, correctly states: “The children are lazy with respect to the event of doing (<quote>gasnu</quote>) the act of imagining (<quote>xanri</quote>) by them (<quote>be ri</quote>).”  

4. In contrast, B’s proposal uses <quote>se xanri</quote>. But <quote>se</quote> is the 2nd-place conversion that swaps x1 and x2 (<quote>se: 2nd conversion; switch 1st/2nd places</quote>). Thus <quote>se xanri be ri</quote> would make x1 = the person who is imagined and x2 = the thing imagining them, reversing the intended roles. That renders “the children were lazy to do what was imagining them,” which is semantically incorrect.  

5. Therefore, only A faithfully represents “what they were imagining.”


CoT Answer for jbo_33:
1. The English sentence means “for each of the many cooks, all of that cook’s children later became cooks themselves.” That is a two-quantifier structure: one quantifier ranges over cooks; inside it, another ranges over that cook’s children.<br><br>2. In Lojban, placing a quantifier in the prenex (before <quote>zo'u</quote>) makes it scope over the whole bridi. For a universal, we use <quote>ro</quote> plus a descriptor, as in the background example:<br><quote>ro da zo'u da viska mi</quote><br>“For-every X: X sees me.” (Section 16.3)<br><br>3. We must quantify “the many cooks” first: <invalid_quote>ro lo so'i jukpa se jibri zo'u</invalid_quote>. Here:<br>  • <quote>'Word: so'i', 'English': 'many'</quote> marks “many.”<br>  • <quote>'jukpa', 'Lojban definition': 'x₁ cooks … x₂'</quote> makes “cook.”<br>  • <quote>se jibri</quote> converts “child-of” (panzi) into its x1 place, so “the cooks.”<br><br>4. Answer A instead embeds the cook-quantifier inside the predicate <invalid_quote>panzi be ro lo so'i jukpa se jibri</invalid_quote>. This reads roughly “children of all the many cooks,” effectively saying “for each child-of-all-the-many-cooks,” which is nonsense or at least not the intended scoping. The cook quantifier doesn’t scope over <quote>panzi</quote> at the top level.<br><br>5. By contrast, Answer B correctly says:<br><invalid_quote>ro lo so'i jukpa se jibri zo'u ro panzi be ri …</invalid_quote><br>– First, <invalid_quote>ro lo so'i jukpa se jibri zo'u</invalid_quote> scopes over cooks. Then inside we have <quote>ro panzi be ri …</quote>, “for each child of that cook,” using <quote>ri</quote> to pick up the current cook (Section 7.6: “The cmavo ri … has the same referent as the last complete sumti appearing before the ri”).<br><br>6. The rest (<invalid_quote>ba co'a se jibri lo ka jukpa ku vau si'a</invalid_quote>) properly expresses “later became cooks themselves.”<br><br>7. Therefore, only Answer B has the correct prenex quantifier structure. Answer A’s internal quantifier mis-scopes, yielding the wrong meaning.


CoT Answer for jbo_34:
1. In Lojban, the particle <quote>be</quote> is a sumti linker whose default role is to fill the x2 place of the preceding selbri: <quote>'sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri; used in descriptions'</quote>.  2. The gismu <quote>korbi</quote> has place structure x1 = edge/margin/border of x2 next to x3: <quote>'x1 is an edge/margin/border/curb/boundary of x2 next-to/bordering-on x3.' </quote>  3. The gismu <quote>rirxe</quote> has place structure x1 = river of land mass x2: <quote>'x1 is a river of land mass x2, draining watershed x3 into x4/...'</quote>.  4. In sentence (A) “lo korbi be lo rirxe”, the selbri is korbi (edge) and the linked sumti lo rirxe fills x2 (the thing of which this is the edge). Thus it literally means "an edge of the river," i.e. a riverbank.  5. In contrast, (B) “lo rirxe be lo korbi” makes rirxe (river) the selbri and lo korbi the x2 argument: "a river of the bank," which describes a river whose x2 is a bank, not the edge of a river. That does not correspond to "sitting on the riverbank."  6. Therefore the correct translation is (A) la .alis. cu zutse lo korbi be lo rirxe, and Debater_B’s recommendation (B) is mistaken because it inverts the selbri–sumti linkage.


CoT Answer for jbo_35:
1. The selbri <quote>steci</quote> in Lojban takes a property abstraction (an NU bridi) as its x1, so we need a CBAR (ce’u-abstraction) that creates a single variable for both occurrences of the clothes in the washing and counting events.  

2. The lambda pronoun <quote>ce’u</quote> creates a fresh variable each time it appears. As the background states, “Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using ce’u.” (Section 7.11) Using <quote>lo ka ce’u lo taxfu pe ce’u ba gi lumci gi kancu</quote> without assignment produces two distinct variables, breaking the intended link between “your clothes” in the washing and counting contexts.  

3. To refer to the same variable twice, Lojban uses the pro-sumti assignment <quote>goi</quote> to bind a named pronoun (here <quote>ko’a</quote>) to the first <quote>ce’u</quote> and then reuse <quote>ko’a</quote> for the second occurrence. As shown in Example 7.22, “<quote>ko’a goi la .alis.</quote>” explicitly ties <quote>ko’a</quote> to <quote>la .alis.</quote>.  

4. Choice B, <quote>steci do fa lo ka ce’u goi ko’a lo taxfu pe ko’a ba gi lumci gi kancu</quote>, correctly assigns the first <quote>ce’u</quote> to <quote>ko’a</quote> and then uses <quote>ko’a</quote> to refer to the same clothes in both the washing and counting parts.  

5. In contrast, choice A lacks any <quote>goi</quote> assignment, so its repeated <quote>ce’u</quote> variables are unlinked and do not express “the same clothes” being washed and then counted.  

Therefore, only choice B provides a well-formed unary property abstraction for <quote>steci</quote> that ties the same clothes variable across both events, making B the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_36:
The key is the place structure of the selbri <quote>valsi</quote>, which has three places: x1 is the word, x2 is its meaning, and x3 is the language.  In English 'How many words do you know in Malay?', 'Malay' must fill the third place (the language).  

Moreover, the cmavo <quote>be</quote> by itself attaches its sumti to the second place (<quote>default x2</quote>), which would wrongly ask 'how many words meaning Malay things do you know?'.  To put 'Malay' into the third place, we must use the place-tagging cmavo <quote>fi</quote> (which <quote>tags 3rd sumti place</quote>).  

Thus the correct translation is:  
  slabu do fa xo valsi be fi lo meljo  
              ^^^     ^^^^^^^^^^^        
             'How many'   'word'     'in Malay'

Answer B (<quote>be lo meljo</quote>) would leave 'lo meljo' in the second place, giving 'words meaning Malay things'.  Only answer A (<quote>be fi lo meljo</quote>) correctly places 'Malay' as the language (x3 place).


CoT Answer for jbo_37:
1. The cmavo <quote>pe</quote> is a restrictive relative phrase marker that attaches to the preceding sumti to indicate an association or possession: <quote>restrictive relative phrase marker: which is associated with ...; loosest associative/possessive</quote>.  
2. In Lojban, the thing being possessed (the dog) must appear before the <quote>pe</quote>-phrase, and the possessor (the teacher) appears inside that phrase.  
3. Choice A, “lo ctuca pe lo gerku cu morsi,” literally means “the teacher which is associated with the dog is dead” – i.e. it says the teacher of the dog is dead, not the dog.  
4. Choice B, “lo gerku pe lo ctuca cu morsi,” correctly means “the dog which is associated with the teacher is dead,” matching the English “The teacher’s dog is dead.”  
5. Therefore the only correct translation is choice B.


CoT Answer for jbo_38:
1. The predicate zvajbi has two argument places (x1 near x2). To express “The chair is close to the table, and the lamp to the wall,” we need two instances of zvajbi connected by a forethought connective “both…and…and….”, i.e. ge … gi … .

2. In each half of the forethought-connected pair, we must explicitly mark the x1 place with fa to ensure that lo stizu (the chair) and lo gustci (the lamp) each occupy zvajbi’s x1 place. As the grammar states: <quote>fa tags x1 place</quote>.

3. Option B (“zvajbi fa ge lo stizu lo jubme gi lo gustci lo bitmu”) only uses fa before lo stizu. According to the FA rules, <quote>after a FA-tagged sumti, any sumti following it occupy the places numerically succeeding it</quote>. Thus in B, the second branch’s untagged lo gustci will incorrectly fill x2 of the first zvajbi, not x1 of the second, yielding nonsense.

4. Option A (“zvajbi ge fa lo stizu lo jubme gi fa lo gustci lo bitmu”) correctly places fa in both branches, so that each branch’s x1 is properly tagged. Therefore A is the proper standard Lojban translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_39:
1. In Lojban, the event abstractor <quote>nu</quote> must scope over the entire bridi “birds start to sing,” so that it becomes the x2 sumti of <quote>smaji</quote>. As Section 11.2 explains: <quote>Its purpose is to capture the event or state of the bridi considered as a whole.</quote> Thus we need <quote>lo nu lo cipni co'a cmoni</quote> as a single sumti meaning “the event of the birds starting to sing.”  

2. The ZAhO cmavo <quote>co'u</quote> functions as “cessative” or “until,” marking the point when the preceding state ends. As Section 10.10 states: <quote>Specifically, __co'u__ marks the boundary between the __ca'o__ and the __ba'o__ parts of an event</quote>. Example 10.55 shows the pattern: <quote>mi pu co'u citka le mi sanmi — I ceased eating my meal.</quote> By analogy, <quote>smaji co'u lo nu lo cipni co'a cmoni</quote> means “It was quiet until the event of the birds starting to sing.”  

3. Answer A (<quote>smaji co'u ku co'a lo nu lo cipni cu cmoni</quote>) wrongly inserts <quote>ku</quote>, the elidable terminator, between <quote>co'u</quote> and <quote>co'a</quote>. As Section 5.7 explains, <quote>ku</quote> ends a sumti description and should be omitted when the contour cmavo and the abstracted event form one continuous sumti. By using <quote>ku</quote> there, A splits into two disconnected bridi (“It stopped being quiet.” “The birds started to sing.”) rather than expressing “until.”  

4. Therefore the correct, faithful translation is B:  
   smaji co'u lo nu lo cipni co'a cmoni  
   “It was quiet until the birds started to sing.”


CoT Answer for jbo_40:
The goal is to tell someone “Please pee in the toilet, not on the floor.”  Answer A, “.e'o lo pinca be do cu farlu ge lo nenri be lo vimstizu gi nai lo loldi,” correctly says “please let your urine fall into the inside of the toilet, and not onto the floor,” whereas B mangles the event and grouping.  

1. We need to describe urine as dropping into the toilet.  In A we have:
   - <quote>farlu: x₁ falls/drops to x₂ from x₃ in gravity well/frame of reference x₄.</quote>
   - The selbri <quote>farlu</quote> naturally captures “fall” (i.e. let your urine fall).  
   - A links it to its actor with <quote>lo pinca be do</quote> (“the urine of you”).

2. In contrast, B uses <quote>vikmi</quote>:
   - <quote>vikmi: x₁ [body] excretes waste x₂ from source x₃ via means/route x₄.</quote>
   - That forces a bodily excretion event, not simply letting urine fall, and mis‐specifies the action.

3. To locate the fall inside the toilet, A uses:
   - <quote>nenri: x₁ is in/inside/within x₂.</quote>
   - <quote>lo nenri be lo vimstizu</quote> (“the being‐inside of the toilet”).
   - These are connected to the fall by the logical connective <quote>ge</quote> (“both…and”).
   - The negation of the floor is handled by <quote>gi nai lo loldi</quote> (“and not the floor”).

4. B tries to group location and negation with a termset marker:
   - It inserts <quote>pe'e</quote> (“marks the following connective as joining termsets”), then <quote>je nai</quote> to negate adjacency to the floor.  This lumps “in the toilet” and “not adjacent to the floor” into one termset, which is ungrammatical and obscures the intended separate conditions.

5. By contrast, A cleanly expresses two separate bridi:
   – urine falls, and it is inside the toilet, 
   – and (gi nai) it is not onto the floor.

Therefore the correct translation is A, as it accurately and idiomatically expresses “please let your urine fall into the toilet, and not on the floor.”


CoT Answer for jbo_41:
1. The speaker’s sentence has two parts: a vocative “Bye Patrick” and the main bridi expressing hope “I hope you get better.”
2. In Lojban, the vocative uses co‘o plus a name: <quote>Example 8.74. coi. frank. Hello, Frank.</quote>  By analogy, “Bye Patrick” is co‘o la .patrik.
3. The hope indicator .a’o is an attitudinal free modifier that attaches to the bridi it modifies, not to the name.  For instance, it appears immediately before the bridi in Example 13.29:
   <quote>Example 13.29. .a’o | mi | kanryze’a ... I hope I feel better tomorrow!</quote>
4. Attitudinal indicators can also appear after the bridi they modify, as in Example 13.41 where permission .e’a follows the main sentence:
   <quote>Example 13.41. do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e’a  … You drive the car. … and that’s fine.</quote>
5. In choice A (co’o la .patrik. .a’o do kanryze’a), .a’o sits next to the name, risking attachment to the name itself rather than to the bridi “do kanryze’a.”  This would ambiguously yield “the one who hopefully is Patrick.”
6. In choice B (co’o la .patrik. do kanryze’a .a’o), .a’o is correctly adjacent to the bridi “do kanryze’a,” unambiguously meaning “I hope you get better.”
7. Therefore the correct, unambiguous translation is choice B.


CoT Answer for jbo_42:
Both candidates agree on “ca lo nu snimycarvi kei” to mark “when it snows,” mirroring Example 11.2’s use of NU abstraction: <quote>Example 11.2. nu mi klama le zarci kei – an-event-of my going-to the store.</quote> The real choice is how to express “I want to dance.”  

Choice B, “mi djica dansu,” treats dansu as a bare sumti to djica without enclosing it in an NU abstraction.  But as Example 11.4 shows, whenever djica takes an event as its x2, that event must be wrapped in NU…KEI: <quote>Example 11.4. la djan. cu djica le nu sonci [kei] – John desires the event-of being-a-soldier.</quote> Without NU on dansu, B is ungrammatical.  

Choice A, “mi dansu djica,” instead builds a tanru predicate head-finally (event-of-dance + desire) exactly like Example 11.3: <quote>Example 11.3. la djan. cu nu sonci kei djica – John wants to be a soldier.</quote>  In A, dansu djica is a single compound selbri meaning “want-to-dance,” yielding the correct “I want to dance.”  

Therefore only A is a grammatical, idiomatic rendering.


CoT Answer for jbo_43:
1. The English sentence “Soon after reaching the coast, he jumped into the water” requires that the event “reaching the coast” serve as the temporal reference point, and then the jump happens a short time later.  

2. In Lojban, setting a new reference base for time is done with ki.  As defined:  <quote>tense/modal: set/use tense default; establishes new open scope space/time/modal reference base</quote> (cmavo ki).  Without ki, the tense applies to the speaker's default “now,” not to the arrival event.  

3. The phrase “soon” is expressed by the temporal-distance cmavo zi:  <quote>time tense distance: instantaneous-to-short distance in time</quote> (selma'o ZI).  The sense “after” is given by ba:  <quote>time tense relation/direction: will [selbri]; after [sumti]; default future tense</quote> (selma'o PU).  Together ba zi applied to the jumping verb plipe correctly means “will jump shortly after.”  

4. Therefore the correct structure is:  
   • ra ki lo nu ra darca lo xaskoi — “that recent person (ra), setting the event of his arriving at the coast (lo nu …) as the time reference (ki)”  
   • cu ba zi plipe lo djacu — “then shortly afterward (ba zi) he jumps into the water.”  

5. Debater_B’s choice (A) <quote>ra ba zi lo nu ra darca lo xaskoi cu plipe lo djacu</quote> incorrectly attaches ba zi directly to the abstraction <quote>lo nu ra darca lo xaskoi</quote> without resetting the time base.  This treats the coast‐arrival itself as a short duration rather than as the anchor point, misrendering “soon after.”  

6. Only answer B uses ki to establish the arrival event as the new “now,” then applies ba zi to the jumping verb, faithfully translating “Soon after X, Y.”


CoT Answer for jbo_44:
We need the Lojban word that corresponds to “cry tears” rather than “cry out/shout.”  The background gives <quote>x₁ weeps/cries tears x₂ about/for reason x₃ (event/state).</quote> for klaku, and <quote>x₁ cries out/yells/howls sound x₂; x₁ is a crier.</quote> for krixa.  In the English sentence “At the funeral, I could do nothing but cry,” the meaning is to shed tears in sorrow, not to shout or howl, so klaku is the correct selbri.  

Furthermore, kakne expresses “is able to do/be capable of doing x₂” (<quote>x₁ is able to do/be/capable of doing/being x₂ (event/state) under conditions x₃ (event/state).</quote>), and po’o marks “the only relevant case.”  Thus “lo ka klaku ku po’o kakne” correctly means “only capable of the property of weeping tears,” whereas “lo ka krixa ku po’o kakne” would bizarrely mean “only capable of yelling.”  

Debater_B’s argument for option B mistakenly substitutes krixa (to cry out) for the proper emotional crying of klaku.  In a funeral context one sheds tears quietly, not cries out.  Therefore the correct translation is answer A: ca lo mronunsla mi lo ka klaku ku po’o kakne.

1. The English sentence “What we talked about is very important to both of us” requires a translation of “what we talked about” as the topic of our discussion, not as the listener or recipient of speech. 
2. Debater_B’s proposal <quote>lo se tavla be mi'o</quote> wrongly treats the thing in question as the listener of a speech act.  The gismu <quote>tavla</quote> has place structure “x1 talks to x2 about x3 in language x4” (Section 2.5), so using <quote>se tavla</quote> swaps x1 and x2, making x1 the addressee, not the topic.  Thus <quote>lo se tavla be mi'o</quote> would mean “that which is talked to us”, i.e. “what is said to us,” not “what we talked about.”
3. In contrast, the gismu <quote>casnu</quote> has place structure “x1 discusses/talks about topic/subject x2” (Section 14.15), so <quote>se casnu</quote> swaps x1 and x2 and brings the topic into the x1 position.  Attaching <quote>be mi'o</quote> as the default x2 sumti then yields “the thing which is discussed by the mass ‘me-and-you’,” precisely “what we talked about.”
4. Finally, <quote>ro mi'o</quote> correctly expresses “to both of us” as a universal scope over the speaker–listener mass.
5. Therefore only translation B, <quote>lo se casnu be mi'o cu vajni sai ro mi'o</quote>, faithfully captures “What we talked about is very important to both of us.”


CoT Answer for jbo_46:
We want “three of the seven cats are black,” i.e. three individual cats out of the set of seven.  In Lojban, “lo” picks out individuals that satisfy a predicate, while “loi” picks out the mass as a whole.  <quote>“lo”: ‘veridical descriptor: the one(s) that really is(are) ...’</quote>  Thus “lo ze mlatu” is “the ones that really are seven cats,” i.e. the seven individual cats.  By contrast, <quote>“loi”: ‘veridical descriptor: the mass of individual(s) that is(are) ...’</quote> so “loi ze mlatu” denotes the mass of seven cats as a single entity, not seven individuals.  To say exactly three cats out of those seven are black, we use “ci lo ze mlatu cu xekri.”  This parallels the standard indefinite‐description pattern: <quote>Example 6.44. ci gerku [ku] cu blabi — Three dogs are white.</quote> where “ci lo gerku cu blabi” correctly means “three dogs are white.”  Similarly, “ci lo ze mlatu cu xekri” means “three of the seven cats are black.”  Using “ci loi ze mlatu” would be semantically wrong, since it would quantify over masses rather than individuals.


CoT Answer for jbo_47:
The English phrase “I repeat, we’re closer to the end than to the beginning” uses a discourse marker meaning “I repeat” rather than addressing the hearer to repeat. In Lojban, the discursive cmavo for “repeating – continuing” is ke’u (UI3), not the vocative ke’o.  

1. ke’o is a vocative meaning “please repeat [your utterance]” and is used to request the listener to repeat what they have said.  Debater_B’s choice wrongly inserts a vocative where none is called for. <quote>“ke’o … please repeat”</quote>  
2. ke’u is the discursive cmavo for “repeating – continuing,” perfectly matching the English “I repeat” as a discourse marker. It does not address the hearer but signals that the speaker is reiterating. <quote>{'Lojban': 'ke\'u', 'English': 'repeating', 'Definition': 'discursive: repeating - continuing'}</quote>  
3. Therefore the correct rendition is “zmadu ke’u fa lo fanmo lo krasi lo ka mi'o zvajbi,” using ke’u to mark “I repeat” rather than ke’o. Debater_B’s reliance on ke’o is a category error, misusing a vocative in place of a discursive.


CoT Answer for jbo_48:
1. In Lojban, a vocative like coi is a free modifier that may appear at the beginning or the end of a sentence, after any elidable terminator.  As the background explains, <quote>“Vocative phrases are not sumti … They can be placed after any elidable terminator … at the beginnings and ends of sentences.”</quote>  Thus putting coi at the end is fully grammatical.

2. The core bridi “I am new” must be mi cnino (sumti mi, selbri cnino).  That captures “Hi, I’m new” literally.  Reordering to coi mi cnino instead wrongly makes the vocative phrase modify mi, yielding “Hello, me, I’m new,” which is unnatural and conflates the speaker and addressee slots.

3. As further evidence, Example 6.72 shows a vocative at the end: <quote>“ko klama mi doi djan. … Come to me, John!”</quote>  By direct analogy, “mi cnino coi” means “I am new; hi,” which matches the English word order and the intended meaning.

4. In contrast, “coi mi cnino” forces mi into the vocative phrase (making the speaker address themselves), rather than preserving mi as the x1 of cnino.  That misassigns arguments and does not reflect the English “I’m new”.

Therefore, the correct Lojban translation is answer A: mi cnino coi.


CoT Answer for jbo_49:
First, note the meanings of the relevant words: <quote>'lo' is a veridical descriptor: the one(s) that really is(are)…'</quote>, <quote>'mi' is a pro-sumti: me/we the speaker(s)/author(s)'</quote>, <quote>'re' is the digit/number 2 (two)</quote>, <quote>'blanu' is ‘- blue’ (x1 is blue)</quote>, and <quote>'creka' is ‘- shirt’ (x1 is a shirt, x2 material).</quote>  

In a lo-descriptor, any sumti placed immediately after <quote>'lo'</quote> serves as a possessor (equivalent to using <quote>be</quote>).  Thus in “lo mi re blanu creka”, <quote>'mi'</quote> right after <quote>'lo'</quote> makes it “the shirt(s) of me…”.  The number <quote>'re'</quote> then quantifies the descriptor <quote>'blanu creka'</quote> (“blue shirt”), yielding exactly “my two blue shirts.”  

By contrast, in “lo re mi blanu creka” the numeral <quote>'re'</quote> comes first and occupies the quantifier slot, so the next sumti <quote>'mi'</quote> is taken as the noun (predicate) being quantified—i.e. “the two me’s that are blue shirts,” effectively “the two of us are blue shirts,” which does not match “my two blue shirts.”  

Therefore the correct translation is choice B: “do ma zvasisku .i lo mi re blanu creka.”


CoT Answer for jbo_50:
We need a sentence of the form “Did they force [event]?” where the gismu <quote>bapli</quote> takes two arguments: the forcer (x1) and an event (x2). <quote>bapli: x1 [force] … event x2</quote>. Option B uses <quote>ka</quote>, the property abstractor, producing a property rather than an event, so it cannot express “to eat” as an action that was compelled. Furthermore, B inserts an extra sumti <quote>do</quote> before bapli, incorrectly assigning ‘you’ as the event argument instead of embedding you inside the event term. In contrast, Option A embeds “you eat” inside an event abstraction with <quote>nu</quote>, the correct event abstractor: <quote>nu do citka</quote> = “the event of you eating”. Thus <quote>xu ra bapli lo nu do citka</quote> literally asks, “Did they force the event ‘you eat’?”, exactly matching the English “Did they force you to eat?”.


CoT Answer for jbo_51:
1. We must match the English middle-voice “This chair is easy to fold” by making the folding of the chair (an action/event) fill frili’s x1 place, with an unspecified agent in x2.  

2. The gismu frili has place structure “x1 (action) is easy … for x2 (agent) under conditions x3” — exactly what we need: the action (folding the chair) is x1, and the agent may remain unspoken.  

   <quote>x1 (action) is easy/simple/facile for x2 (agent) under conditions x3; x2 does x1 freely/easily.</quote>  

3. The folding relation polje is “x1 (force) folds/creases x2 at locus … forming creases x3.”  To refer to the event of folding this chair, we abstract over polje with ka and the demonstrator ti noi stizu.  

   <quote>x1 (force) folds/creases x2 at locus/loci/forming crease(s)/bend(s) x3.</quote>  

4. In choice B, we write:

   frili fa lo ka polje ti noi stizu

   — where fa tags the entire “folding-this-chair” abstraction into frili’s x1 place.  The agent (x2) and conditions (x3) are left implicit, yielding “the folding of this chair is easy (for one).”  

   <quote>fa … sumti place tag: tag 1st sumti place</quote>  

5. By contrast, A begins with se frili, swapping frili’s x1 and x2.  That misattributes agency to the chair (“the chair is the one that easily does the folding”), yielding “this chair finds it easy to fold things” rather than “is easy to fold.”  It thus fails to capture the intended middle-voice meaning.

Therefore, the correct translation is answer B.


CoT Answer for jbo_52:
1. The English adverb “automatically” must modify the main predicate, not the noun phrase “transparency.” In Lojban, adverbs like this are rendered by their own selbri. 2. The gismu zmiku means “x1 is automatic in function x2 under conditions x3.” Thus we want: windows (x1) are automatic in the function of varying transparency (x2). <quote>{'Lojban': 'zmiku', 'Lojban definition': 'x1 is automatic in function x2 under conditions x3.'}</quote> 3. The phrase “vary in transparency” is expressed by cenba lo ka guskli: cenba = “x1 varies in property x2,” and lo ka guskli = “the property of being transparent.” <quote>{'Lojban': 'cenba', 'Lojban definition': 'x1 varies/changes in property/quantity x2.'}</quote> <quote>{'Lojban': 'guskli', 'English': '- transparent'}</quote> 4. Therefore the correct structure is “lo canko cu zmiku lo ka cenba lo ka guskli.” 5. In choice B, “lo canko cu cenba lo ka guskli poi zmiku” wrongly attaches zmiku as a relative clause to lo ka guskli (“the transparency that is automatic”), which not only fails to make “automatically” modify the predicate but also uses a sentence-level relative clause with poi, disallowed in standard Lojban. Hence B is incorrect and A is the only correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_53:
1. The gismu <quote>pluka</quote> has place structure “x1 (event/state) seems pleasant to x2 under conditions x3” (see <quote>pluka: x1 (event/state) seems pleasant to/pleases x2 under conditions x3.</quote>). To say “Helen enjoys running through the woods,” we must make the event of running through the woods the x1 argument, and Helen the x2 argument of <quote>pluka</quote>.

2. In option A, <quote>la .xelen. cu pluka lo ka bajra pa'o lo rictu'a</quote>, Helen is placed as x2 by position but the event-of-running (‘lo ka bajra pa'o lo rictu'a’) comes after without any place‐tag, so the listener defaults it into the x1 place—but A also uses <quote>cu</quote> after the sumti, splitting the bridi unnecessarily and making the property descriptor ambiguous.

3. By contrast, option B uses the FA tag <quote>fa</quote> to unambiguously mark the event abstraction as x1.  From the FA section: <quote>fa: sumti place tag: tag 1st sumti place</quote>. In <quote>pluka la .xelen. fa lo ka bajra pa'o lo rictu'a</quote>, “la .xelen.” is the first untagged sumti and so becomes x2 (the experiencer), while <quote>fa lo ka bajra pa'o lo rictu'a</quote> explicitly marks the running‐through‐the‐woods event as x1.

4. Moreover, because <quote>pluka</quote> is the selbri at the start of B, no <quote>cu</quote> is needed (per the rule: <quote>no cu is permitted before the selbri if there are no preceding sumti</quote>). Option B thus respects both the correct place‐structure of <quote>pluka</quote> and the proper use of FA tags, giving an unambiguous translation: “The event of running through the woods (x1) pleases Helen (x2).”

CoT Answer for jbo_56:
The key is that English “at least 100 students gathered in front of the building” speaks of one collective event by a group of ≥100 students, not 100 separate individuals each doing some gathering. (1) Debater_B’s choice B places the quantifier on the sumti only: you have “su'o 100 tadni cu jmaji lo crane be lo dinju”, which means roughly “at least 100-of students individually gather in front of the building.” But standard Lojban sumti quantifiers are distributive, so each of those students is separately the x1 of jmaji, not one group entity. As a result, B fails to express a single group event. Cite: <quote>Definition: digit/number: at least (some); no less than</quote> (su'o), and <quote>x1 (mass/jo'u) gathers/collects at location x2 from locations x3 (mass/jo'u).</quote> (jmaji). (2) In contrast, A uses two property abstractions plus the connective kancusu'oi to attach both the cardinality property and the gathering event property to one entity. First, “lo ka su’o 100 mei gi’e tadni” abstracts “x is a mass of at least one-hundred students” (<quote>convert number to cardinality selbri; x1 is the mass formed from set x2 whose n member(s) are x3</quote>, mei; <quote>abstractor: property/quality abstractor (-ness); x1 is quality/property exhibited by [bridi]</quote>, ka). Second, “lo ka jmaji lo crane be lo dinju” abstracts “x is the event of gathering in front of the building” (jmaji; ka). Finally, “kancusu’oi” links these two properties onto the same x: <quote>Something is such that both x1 and x2 are related to it by predicate x3</quote>. That precisely matches the intended meaning: one group entity is both ≥100 students and gathered in front of the building. Thus A correctly captures the plural, collective event that B’s distributive quantifier misses.


CoT Answer for jbo_57:
1. We must express “I know that you want one of these dishes” by embedding the quantifier ‘one of these dishes’ inside the predication that goes into djuno.  
2. Option A uses tu’a: <quote>mi djuno lo du'u do kaidji tu'a su'o lo me ti sanmi</quote>.  But as the text warns, “Using __tu'a__ is a kind of laziness: it makes speaking easier at the possible expense of clarity for the listener.” (<quote>Section 11.10: “Using __tu'a__ is a kind of laziness... loses information”</quote>)  Here tu’a abstracts “wanting” and then su’o is outside the du’u, so the quantifier isn’t properly inside the knowing clause.  
3. Option B instead writes <invalid_quote>mi djuno lo du'u su'o lo me ti sanmi do jai se kaidji</invalid_quote>, bringing the existential quantifier into the du’u before converting the selbri with jai.  This correctly scopes “at least one of these dishes” under the knowing, so you truly “know that you want one of these dishes.”  
4. The choice of jai is crucial: as explained, “a counterpart of some sort is needed to __tu'a__ which transposes an abstract sumti into a concrete one.  This is achieved... by the cmavo __jai__” (<quote>Section 11.10: “This is achieved... by the cmavo __jai__”</quote>).  Here, jai se kaidji raises the dish you want into the x1 position so the quantifier binds it properly inside the du’u.  
5. Finally, the negative clause “but I don’t know which one” is identically rendered in both A and B, so the only correct difference is the embedding of su’o and the use of jai in B.  Therefore B matches the intended scope and is the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_58:
The English sentence “We decorated the room with ribbons and banners” clearly expresses a causative action: we caused the room to be adorned. However, the gismu <quote>jadni</quote> is defined simply as “x₁ (object) adorns/decorates x₂” and lacks any causative force. <quote>x_{1} (object) adorns/decorates x_{2}; x_{1} is an adornment/decoration of x_{2}</quote> To convey causation in Lojban, one must use the lujvo <quote>seljadnygau</quote>, which is composed of se+jadni+gasnu and means “cause to adorn”. <quote>seljadnygau: se+jadni+gasnu</quote> Thus option A, <quote>mi'a seljadnygau lo kumfa lo'e dasri jo'u lo'e lanci</quote>, correctly renders “we caused the room to be adorned by ribbons and banners.”

By contrast, Debater_B’s option B, <quote>mi'a jadni lo kumfa se pi'o lo'e dasri jo'u lo'e lanci</quote>, misuses <quote>pi'o</quote> (the BAI cmavo “used by”) as a conversion to indicate instrument, but never expresses the causative agent. It would literally say “we are decorations of the room used by ribbons and banners,” which fails to match the intended meaning. Therefore B is incorrect and A is the proper translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_59:
1. The selbri botpi has four places, the fourth being the lid. <quote>botpi: x₁ is a bottle/jar/urn/flask/closable container for x₂, made of material x₃ with lid x₄.</quote>

2. Using fo zi'o labels the 4th place as irrelevant or ‘nonexistent’, but does not itself assert that no lid actually exists. As the grammar explains: <quote>The cmavo zi'o represents a value which does not even exist. When a bridi fills one of its places with zi'o, what is really meant is that the selbri has a place which is irrelevant to the true relationship the speaker wishes to express.</quote> Thus, “ti botpi fo zi'o” merely blocks mention of a lid—it doesn’t deny its existence.

3. To explicitly state “without a lid,” we must assert the absence of any lid. This requires the digit zero and an existential variable: <quote>'no', ... Definition: 'digit/number: 0 (digit) [zero]'</quote> and <quote>'da', ... Definition: 'logically quantified existential pro-sumti: there exists something 1'</quote>. Together “no da” means “there are zero such things.”

4. We connect the two claims—blocking the lid place and asserting zero lids—with the logical connective .e (“and”): <quote>'.e', ... Definition: 'logical connective: sumti afterthought and'</quote>.

5. Therefore the correct full translation is “ti botpi fo zi'o .e no da” (“This is a bottle with its lid place blocked—and there is zero lid”). Debater_B’s answer omits the explicit negation and so fails to assert that no lid exists, making choice B uniquely correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_60:
We must close the event abstraction <quote>lo’e nu cladu</quote> before moving on to the next bridi-tail.  In (A), the <quote>ku</quote> after <quote>lo’e nu cladu</quote> correctly terminates that sumti, so “he fears loudness” stands as a separate event.  Then <quote>gi’e ku’i se tolzdi lo’e nu smaji</quote> properly begins the contrasting clause “but is bored by silence.”  In (B), however, the absence of <quote>ku</quote> means the <quote>nu cladu</quote> abstraction is never closed and unintentionally swallows the entire following connective and predicate.  As a result, (B) would be parsed as “he fears the event that loudness and he is bored by silence,” rather than the intended two distinct assertions.  Therefore the correct, fully terminated translation is (A).


CoT Answer for jbo_61:
Debater_B’s proposal (<quote>je</quote>) uses the selma’o for “and” rather than “or.” According to the grammar, <quote>je</quote> is a tanru-internal logical “and,” not the connective needed to express “neither … nor.” By contrast, <quote>ja</quote> is the tanru-internal logical “or.” 

In Lojban, the prenex <quote>na ku zo'u</quote> negates the entire following bridi group, so to say “neither X nor Y” we must connect X and Y with “or” inside the scope of the negation, then apply <quote>na ku zo'u</quote> outside. Using <quote>ja</quote> yields:
  na ku zo'u (ti noi cinta cu mapti lo bitmu) ja (lo bitmu cu toljinsa)
which correctly means “It is not the case that: the paint matches the wall or the wall is dirty,” i.e. “the paint doesn’t match the wall, and neither is the wall dirty.”

If one instead uses <quote>je</quote> as Debater_B suggests, the sentence means “The paint doesn’t match the wall, and the wall isn’t dirty” where only the first clause is negated globally and the second clause is simply an affirmative conjunction. That fails to mirror the English neither-nor structure, because the wall’s cleanliness must also fall under the global negation. Therefore the correct translation must use <quote>ja</quote>, making answer B the only accurate choice.


CoT Answer for jbo_62:
1. The predicate zvati requires its second argument to be a location sumti, not a direction cmavo. According to the background, <quote>'zvati', 'x₁ (object/event) is at/attending/present at x₂ (event/location).'</quote> Thus the object must be “at” a place, not moving “away from” or “beyond” it.

2. Choice B uses ze'o, which is defined as a direction indicator, not a location descriptor. In the background we read <quote>'ze'o', 'location tense relation/direction; beyond/outward/receding from ...'</quote>. That means ze'o lo garbi'u only conveys motion outward from the fence. It does not yield a static place for zvati to take as its x₂.

3. By contrast, choice A supplies a proper location sumti built from the gismu ragve and the sumti lo garbi'u linked by be. The gismu ragve is defined as <quote>'x₁ is located across/on the other side of gap/boundary x₂ from x₃.'</quote> Using lo ragve be lo garbi'u fills the gap/boundary argument (x₂) with “the fence,” yielding “the region across the fence.” This is exactly the location at which the tree is.

4. Therefore, lo tricu cu zvati lo ragve be lo garbi'u correctly translates “The tree is across the fence,” providing a stationary location for zvati. Choice B incorrectly uses a direction cmavo that does not satisfy zvati’s place argument.


CoT Answer for jbo_63:
The issue hinges on correctly rendering “as you saw” versus “I observe” in Lojban. Debater_B’s choice (A) begins with za’a, but that cmavo is an evidential meaning “I observe” and must attach to the whole bridi, not to do as the listener. As the background makes clear, <quote>za'a ... I observe</quote> marks “I directly observe” and has no argument place for the addressee. In contrast, ga’a is the modal (BAI) meaning “to observer” / “witnessed by,” which properly expresses “as you saw.” The entry states <quote>ga'a ... to observer ... ; witnessed by ...</quote>. Thus the correct translation uses ga’a do su’o since mi batci, i.e. “Some snake bit me, as you observed.” Debater_B’s use of za’a is therefore semantically and syntactically incorrect.


CoT Answer for jbo_64:
1. The English phrase “Everybody here is sick” means “for every person who is located here, that person is sick.” In Lojban, to restrict a quantified variable, we must attach a restrictive phrase marker (<quote>pe</quote>) before the locator <quote>bu'u ti</quote>. Without <quote>pe</quote>, <quote>bu'u ti</quote> becomes a location tense on the selbri, not a restriction on the variable.

2. Definition of the restrictive phrase marker “pe”:
<quote>'pe', 'restrictive phrase', 'which is associated with ...; loosest associative/possessive'</quote>
This tells us that to say “X which is at this place,” we must use <quote>da pe bu'u ti</quote>.

3. Definition of the location tense “bu'u ti”: 
<quote>'bu'u', 'coincident with/at the same place as; space equivalent of ca'</quote>
and of the demonstrative <quote>ti</quote> (“this here”). When used without <quote>pe</quote> as in <quote>bu'u ti bilma</quote>, it attaches to the selbri “bilma” as a location tense meaning “is sick here,” changing the scope.

4. Consequence in (B) “ro da bu'u ti bilma”: 
This parses as “For every X, X bu'u ti bilma” = “Everything in the universe, when it is here, is sick.” That is not the intended meaning “everybody who is here is sick.” Instead it says “all things, if here, are sick,” which is a different and unintended claim.

5. In (A) “ro da pe bu'u ti bilma”, the <quote>pe</quote> properly restricts the quantified variable “da” to those “coincident with here,” yielding exactly “for every X which is here, X is sick.”

Therefore the correct translation is A: <quote>ro da pe bu'u ti bilma</quote>.


CoT Answer for jbo_65:
1. The main clause “The chairs are wet now” must be rendered as lo stizu ca cilmo.  In Lojban, the PU tenses always precede the selbri to set the bridi time; here <quote>ca</quote> is the present-tense marker.  Hence <quote>lo stizu ca cilmo</quote> is the correct start.

2. The English “because we didn’t take them in before it started to rain” uses a justification causal.  We must use the krinu-modal <quote>ki’u</quote> (“because of reason”) to introduce a justification clause: <quote>ki’u</quote>.

3. Next we need to scope the two connected sentences with parentheses so that the rain-starting event is treated as the overt argument of the tense-preposition PU.  We use <quote>tu’e</quote> to start the parenthesis.  From definitions: <quote>tu’e: start text scope; start of multiple utterance scope; used for logical/non-logical/ordinal joining of sentences</quote>.

4. Inside the parentheses, first must come the ZAhO–tense “initiative” <quote>co’a</quote> marking “it started to rain” (<quote>co’a carvi</quote>).   Per the event-contours rule, <quote>co’a</quote> marks the very beginning of the rain-event, hence “it started to rain.”

5. Close that parenthesis section and begin the second clause introduced by <quote>pu</quote> “past” together with <quote>bo</quote> short-scope link.  As a tense-preposition (PU), PU “goes with” its overt clause, so the event we now time-locate is “we didn’t put the chairs in.”  Negation of the bridi uses <quote>na</quote> before the selbri, per: <quote>A bridi may have the particle __na__ … The simplest way to express a bridi negation is to use the cmavo __na__ of selma'o NA before the selbri</quote>.

6. That second clause must read <quote>mi'a ru na nergau</quote> (“we long-ago did not put/insert”), where <quote>mi'a</quote> excludes the listener (“we but not you”), and <quote>ru</quote> signals “remote past” (earlier than all other past times).  <quote>nergau</quote> is the lujvo “put/insert into.”

7. Putting it all together in the proper Lojban word order—main clause, causal link, parentheses with rain-start, then PU-bo plus the negated putting-in—gives exactly choice (B):

lo stizu ca cilmo .i ki'u tu'e co'a carvi .i pu bo mi'a ru na nergau

Choice (A) fails because it misorders the tense preposition PU and the BAI modal <quote>ki'u</quote>, causing the wrong bridi to be time-tagged and the causal bracket to attach to the wrong clause.


CoT Answer for jbo_66:
1. The crucial difference lies in how “be” vs. “pe” link the sumti “mi” to the selbri “se pinxe”.
2. The cmavo <quote>{'Lojban': 'be', 'English': 'link sumti', 'Definition': 'sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri; used in descriptions'}</quote> explicitly attaches the following sumti into the x2 place of the selbri. Thus <quote>lo se pinxe be mi</quote> unambiguously means “the thing whose drinking-agent (x2) is me” → “the one I drank.”
3. In contrast, the cmavo <quote>{'Lojban': 'pe', 'English': 'restrictive phrase', 'Definition': 'restrictive relative phrase marker: which is associated with ...; loosest associative/possessive'}</quote> merely creates a restrictive association. <quote>lo se pinxe pe mi</quote> means “the thing (se-pinxe) which is in some unspecified association with me,” which could describe something I made, owned, or otherwise relate to me — not necessarily my drinking action.
4. Only <quote>be</quote> pins down the place‐structure relation (x2=drinker). Therefore “lo se pinxe be mi cu kurkydu'e” is the faithful translation of “The one I drank was too bitter.”


CoT Answer for jbo_67:
Debater_B’s proposal (A) omits any grouping, so by default it is parsed left‐to‐right as “(1 + 2) × 3,” yielding 9, not 7. As the grammar states, <quote>“VUhU operators by default are done left to right, like other Lojban grouping,”</quote> so A actually says 9 = 7, which is false. To force the intended meaning 1 + (2 × 3) = 7, we must group the multiplication as a single operand. Lojban provides explicit parentheses __vei__…__ve'o__ for this purpose: <quote>“In addition, of course, Lojban has the mathematical parentheses __vei__ and __ve'o__, which can be used just like their written equivalents ‘(’ and ‘)’ to group expressions in any way desired:”</quote> By writing “li pa su'i vei re pi'i ci du li ze,” we bracket “re pi'i ci” so that 2×3 = 6 is computed first, then added to 1, giving 7. Thus (B) faithfully renders “One plus two times three is seven,” while (A) miscomputes the result and fails to match the English sentence.


CoT Answer for jbo_68:
We need to express “Walter is to Xenia what Yannick is to Zorro” as “Walter relates to Xenia by the same relation that relates Yannick to Zorro.”  To do this, we form a description of the relation itself using the 3rd‐place conversion <quote>te</quote> on <quote>ckini</quote>, then link two sumti into it with <quote>be…bei</quote> so as to pick out “the relation which relates Yannick to Zorro.”

1. Conversion “te” on a selbri exchanges its 1st and 3rd places, yielding a new predicate whose x1 is the relation:
   <quote>Here are the place structures of _se klama_ … and _te klama_: x1 is the origin and x2 the destination of x3 going via x4 using x5.</quote>  
   By analogy, in _te ckini_, x1 is the relation itself, x2 is the “related‐to” argument, and x3 is the original subject of <quote>ckini</quote> (the source of the relation).

2. We must fill x2 with Zorro and x3 with Yannick, because we want “the relation which relates Yannick to Zorro.”  We do this with linked sumti:
   <quote>These sumti … fill the places of the brivla they are attached to, starting with x2.  If there is more than one sumti, they are separated by the cmavo <quote>bei</quote>.</quote>

3. Therefore the correct inner description is:
   lo te ckini be la .zoros. bei la .ianik.   
   — x2=la .zoros. (the target)   
   — x3=la .ianik. (the source)

4. Debater_B’s proposal uses
   lo te ckini be la .ianik. bei la .zoros.
   which wrongly binds x2 to Yannick and x3 to Zorro, i.e. “the relation which relates Zorro to Yannick,” the opposite of what the English simile requires.

5. As a result, the only correct translation is:
   la .ualter. la .kseni'as. cu ckini lo te ckini be la .zoros. bei la .ianik.

Hence answer A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_69:
1. The English sentence “You don't seem to be very healthy.” is best analysed as “You seem to have the property of being ‘other-than healthy’ (i.e. unhealthy).”  In Lojban, that means using <quote>simlu</quote> on a property abstraction whose selbri is scalar-contrary-negated <quote>kanro</quote>.

2. Choice A, “do na simlu lo ka kanro mutce”, uses bridi negation <quote>na</quote> on <quote>simlu</quote>, which negates the entire relation “you seem to be very healthy.”  But as the background warns, bridi negation applies to the whole bridi, not just the inner predicate, and is reserved for outright contradictions:
   • “mi na klama le zarci” = “It is false that I go to the market.” <quote>(Example 15.15)</quote>
   This doesn’t capture “you seem not to be very healthy,” but rather “it’s false that you seem very healthy.”

3. Moreover, inserting <quote>mutce</quote> inside <quote>lo ka kanro mutce</quote> attaches “very” to the abstraction, but then the outer <quote>na</quote> undoes the entire seeming, which is not the intended meaning.  Lojban prefers internal scalar negation for sub-predicates rather than negating the whole ‘seems’ bridi (outside of very restricted contexts like wanting or liking).

4. By contrast, Choice B, “do simlu lo ka na'e kanro”, uses the scalar-contrary negator <quote>na'e</quote> directly in the property abstraction:
   • “na'e” always applies only to what follows it, not to the trailing sumti <quote>(Example 15.45)</quote>.
   • Thus <quote>lo ka na'e kanro</quote> = “the property of being other-than healthy.”
   • And <quote>do simlu lo ka na'e kanro</quote> = “You seem to have the property of being other-than healthy,” exactly “You don’t seem to be very healthy.”

5. Therefore only B correctly scopes the negation inside the ‘seems’ predicate, matching the intended meaning and Lojban practice.


CoT Answer for jbo_70:
1. The English “again” in “Do you want them to sing that song again?” refers to a single additional occurrence—the second time the song is sung.  
2. In Lojban, ordinal repetition (“the Nᵗʰ time”) is marked by the ordinal-tense cmavo <quote>re'u</quote>, not the simple quantified-tense cmavo <quote>roi</quote>.  As defined, <quote>re'u</quote> “converts number to an objectively quantified ordinal tense interval modifier; defaults to time,” i.e., it marks “the second time,” “the third time,” etc.  
3. By contrast, <quote>roi</quote> is a general frequency marker meaning “[N] times” or “always,” not specifically “again” as a single extra iteration.  Thus <quote>za'u roi</quote> would claim “more than N times” or “more than once” in aggregate, changing the meaning to “Do you want them to sing that song more than once?” not “again.”  
4. Therefore, the correct translation must use <quote>re'u</quote> for “again.”  Option A, <quote>.au pei ra za'u re'u sanga lo me ru .elsa</quote>, properly encodes “again” as the second-time ordinal, whereas B’s use of <quote>roi</quote> is semantically incorrect.


CoT Answer for jbo_71:
1. We need to render “nail polish” as a noun meaning “the polish applied to the nail,” not the action of polishing.  
2. The cmavo spali is a gismu meaning “x1 (agent) polishes object/surface x2 with polish x3, applied using tool x4” <quote>x1 (agent) polishes object/surface x2 with polish x3, applied using tool x4.</quote>  This expresses an action, not an object.  
3. By contrast, the gismu jadni means “x1 (object) adorns/decorates x2; x1 is an adornment/decoration of x2” <quote>x1 (object) adorns/decorates x2; x1 is an adornment/decoration of x2; x2 is fancy/decorated.</quote>  This directly denotes an ornamental object.  
4. Nail polish is precisely an adornment for a nail.  Since jgalu means “claw/nail” <quote>x1 is a/the claw/nail/talon [body-part] of x2;</quote> combining it with jadni yields “the decoration of a nail.”  
5. Therefore “they could still smell the nail polish” correctly becomes:  ra pu za'o sumne lo jgalu jadni.  
6. Using spali instead (lo jgalu spali) would misinterpret the polish as an action by the nail, so Debater_B’s option (A) is incorrect.


CoT Answer for jbo_72:
To translate “Are there many people who live in Greece and work in Bulgaria?”, we need the connective __je__ to join two independent predicates applied to the same sumti “people.” In Lojban, each description must be properly terminated before a higher-level connector can attach. In (A), we have:
  xu so'i mei fa lo xabju be lo xelso ku je jibgu'a be bu'u lo bolgaro
Here the inner sumti “be lo xelso” is ended with <quote>__ku__</quote>, so that __je__ clearly conjoins the two predicates “xabju …” and “jibgu'a ….”  

By contrast, in (B) the __ku__ is omitted:
  xu so'i mei fa lo xabju be lo xelso je jibgu'a be bu'u lo bolgaro
Without the terminator, <invalid_quote>the __je__ attaches inside the <selbri>-sumti</invalid_quote> rather than joining the two predicates.  It yields the nonsensical structure “live in Greeks-and-work in Bulgaria” folded into one place of xabju, instead of two parallel predicates on the same sumti.  

Section 8.6 illustrates the necessity of closing a descriptor before connecting it to another predicate:  
<quote>Example 8.49.  le gerku ku poi blabi cu klama</quote>  
Here the __ku__ ends the sumti “le gerku” so that __poi__ attaches correctly.  Similarly, we must end “be lo xelso” with __ku__ before using __je__ to conjoin it with “jibgu'a …”.  

Therefore (A) is the only well-formed translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_73:
In Lojban, the gismu <quote>famti</quote> has place structure “x1 is an aunt/uncle of x2 …”, so by default x1 refers to the aunt or uncle and x2 to the nephew or niece.  The English sentence “Your nephew writes so cutely” makes the nephew (x2) the subject.  To swap places 1 and 2 in Lojban, we must apply the conversion cmavo <quote>se</quote>, which “switch[es] 1st/2nd places” (selma’o SE).  Without that, as in Debater_B’s proposal, the x1 place remains “your aunt/uncle,” so we would be saying “Your aunt writes cutely.”  Only the variant with <quote>se famti</quote> correctly makes x2 (your nephew) the writer.  Therefore the correct translation is answer A, <quote>iumle sai fa lo nu lo se famti be do cu ciska</quote>.


CoT Answer for jbo_74:
1. The term <quote>tanbo</quote> by default denotes a physical board or plank: <quote>‘x1 is a board/plank [3-dimensional long flat rectangle] of material x2.’</quote> Using “lo tanbo” would thus pick out some board-shaped object, not the governing body that made the decision.
2. To refer to a specific collective entity called “the Board,” Lojban uses the name descriptor <quote>la</quote>: <quote>‘la: name descriptor: the one(s) called ... ; takes name or selbri description.’</quote> Hence “la tanbo” names the Board as an institution.
3. The verb <quote>zu'ejdi</quote> means “decides to do,” and <quote>fitytoltu'i</quote> means “rejects a proposal”: <quote>‘x1 rejects x2 (offer, suggestion, proposal) from x3.’</quote> Combined, “zu'ejdi lo ka fitytoltu'i lo se stidi” says “decides to reject the proposal.”
4. Putting it all together, “la tanbo cu zu'ejdi lo ka fitytoltu'i lo se stidi” correctly means “The Board decided to dismiss the proposal,” whereas option A with “lo tanbo” refers to a generic plank or board, not the named decision-making body.


CoT Answer for jbo_75:
First, note that the lujvo zgipli means “to play an instrument,” i.e. in the predicate _zgipli_ x1 plays x2: <quote>'zgipli', English: 'to play an instrument; to make music out of something'</quote>.  The cmavo be is the sumti-link attaching its sumti as the x2 of the following selbri: <quote>'be', Definition: 'sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri'</quote>.  Thus in (A) _lo zgipli be lo tabra_ identifies the event of playing the trumpet (x2 = lo tabra).  When used as x2 of _tatpi_ (“x1 is tired by x2”), this says “something is tired by the act of playing the trumpet.”  The untagged selbri _tatpi_ with FA tagging _fa lo zgipli be lo tabra_ makes that something the trumpet itself—exactly matching “The trumpet is tired (from being played).”

In contrast, answer (B) inserts the conversion se before zgipli.  But SE is “2nd-place conversion,” swapping x1 and x2 in the place structure: <quote>'se', Formal Language: 'SE', Definition: '2nd conversion; switch 1st/2nd places'</quote>.  Hence _lo se zgipli be lo tabra_ means “the thing played by the trumpet”—i.e. whatever instrument the trumpet plays—nonsensical in context.  Therefore only (A) correctly conveys “The trumpet is tired, could you make her some coffee?” in standard Lojban.


CoT Answer for jbo_76:
1. The key is that cmene predicates take the quoted name as x1 and the thing named as x2.  Option A (“cmene lo jukpa fa la .robert.”) wrongly uses <invalid_quote>la .robert.</invalid_quote> as the quoted word.  But <invalid_quote>la .robert.</invalid_quote> by definition refers to the person called Robert, not the word “Robert.”

2. In standard Lojban, the cmavo zo is used to quote a single following word metalinguistically.  As the grammar text explains:
<quote>The cmavo zo … is a strong quotation mark for the single following word … allows a metalinguistic word to be referenced without having it act on the surrounding text.</quote>

3. The example <quote>zo .bab. cmene la bab.</quote> unambiguously shows that the quoted string must use zo, while la introduces the referent.  Translating “The cook’s name is Robert” therefore requires quoting the string “.robert.” with zo, then stating that this is the cmene of the cook.  That yields:

cmene lo jukpa fa zo .robert.

4. Option B correctly quotes the name itself as x1 of cmene and treats lo jukpa as x2, matching the structure shown in the background.  Option A conflates the name with the person by using la, and so is incorrect.


CoT Answer for jbo_77:
We need a predicate that takes just one argument (the group) to express “the two of you are twins.”  Looking at the background definitions:

<quote>{'Lojban': 'tarbykansa', 'Lojban Composition': 'tarbi+kansa', 'English': 'No definition has been found', 'Type': 'lujvo'}</quote>
This lujvo combines “tarbi” (twin) with “kansa” (together) and yields a two-place predicate: x1 is a twin of x2.  If we write “lo re do tarbykansa,” we supply x1 = lo re do (“the two of you”), but x2 remains unspecified, so it wrongly implies you’re each twin-of somebody else (a hidden third person).

By contrast:

<quote>{'Lojban': "tarbykansi'u", 'Lojban Composition': 'tarbi+kansa+simxu', 'English': 'No definition has been found', 'Type': 'lujvo'}</quote>
The extra “+simxu” turns it into a one-place predicate meaning “x1 are twins.”  Thus “xu lo re do tarbykansi'u” literally asks, “Is it true that the two of you are twins?” — exactly matching English “Are you twins?”

Therefore A is the faithful translation, while B incorrectly uses the two-place tarbykansa and leaves its second argument unfilled.


CoT Answer for jbo_78:
We must distinguish between literal zero‐quantification (no) and existential lower‐bounds (su'o). In Lojban, <quote>no</quote> means “zero of,” while <quote>su'o</quote> means “at least one” if no explicit numeral follows (see Section 6.6, Example 6.32). 

Choice (A) uses <quote>no da no de</quote>, literally “zero of something‐1, zero of something‐2.” This double negation says “I gave nothing to no one,” which in logic reverses to “I gave something to someone,” the exact opposite of our intended meaning. 

By contrast, choice (B) uses <quote>no da su'o de</quote>, i.e. “zero of something‐1 (no gift) to at least one something‐2 (someone).” This correctly conveys “I didn’t give anything to anyone,” asserting that there is at least one recipient for whom I gave nothing. Therefore, the correct translation is mi no da su'o de pu dunda.


CoT Answer for jbo_79:
1. We want to say “Do you have some wine glasses?” in Lojban.  The relevant cmavo and gismu are:
   - <quote>su'o | PA4 | at least | digit/number: at least (some); no less than</quote>
   - <quote>vanju | ... x₁ is made of/contains/is a quantity of wine ... | English: – wine</quote>
   - <quote>kabri | ... x₁ is a cup/glass/tumbler/mug/vessel/[bowl] containing contents x₂ ... | English: – cup</quote>
2. Lojban compounds (tanru) are head-final: the modifier precedes the head.  For example, “white car” is expressed as “blabi karce,” not “karce blabi”:
   <quote>xu do viska le mi blabi karce ... “Do you see my car, the white one?”</quote>
   Here “blabi karce” = “white car,” with the adjective before the noun.
3. By the same rule, “wine cup” (i.e. a glass for wine) is “vanju kabri,” not “kabri vanju.”  Preceding it with “su'o” gives “su'o vanju kabri” = “at least one wine cup” (some wine glasses).
4. Debater_B’s choice, <quote>su'o kabri vanju</quote>, would literally be “some cup-of-wine,” i.e. “some glass of wine,” which is the wrong meaning.
5. Therefore the correct translation is xu do ralte su'o vanju kabri, choice B.


CoT Answer for jbo_80:
In Lojban tanru, the head of a compound is the final word, and the preceding word modifies it. Here we have two gismu: <quote>x1 is cord/cable/rope/line/twine/cordage/woven strands of material x2.</quote> (skori) and <quote>x1 is made of/contains/is a quantity of copper (Cu); [metaphor: reddish, electrical conductor].</quote> (tunka). In “lo skori tunka,” “tunka” is the head, so the sumti refers to copper that is rope-like – i.e. a copper wire, with the primary emphasis on copper. In contrast, “lo tunka skori” makes “skori” the head, yielding a rope (wire) that is copper-like, shifting the focus onto the rope rather than the copper material. Since the English sentence is describing a copper wire (a wire made of copper), our head should be the copper entity. Therefore “lo skori tunka cu mitre li pa” correctly renders “The copper wire is one metre long.” Debater_A’s choice (A) misplaces the head, making rope the primary object rather than copper.


CoT Answer for jbo_81:
1. The intended meaning “Have you worked at a store?” requires saying that you were an employee (jibgu’a) of a store (zarci). “jibgu’a” is defined as “employee” and relates a person to their place of work: <quote>jibgu’a ... English: ‘employee’</quote> and “zarci” is “market/store”: <quote>zarci ... English: ‘- market<br>- shop; store’</quote>.
2. In Lojban compound ordering (tanru), the modifier comes first and the head comes second (head-final). Thus “zarci jibgu’a” means “store-employee” (an employee whose place is a store), whereas “jibgu’a zarci” would parse as “employee-store” (a store that is an employee), which is nonsensical.
3. To express the modal-aspect “have worked and can” we use the CAhA cmavo “pu’i” before the selbri. Therefore “pu’i zarci jibgu’a” correctly yields “can and has been a store-employee.”
4. Debater_B’s preferred “xu do pu’i jibgu’a zarci” misorders the tanru, assigning “zarci” as a sumti of “jibgu’a,” so it literally says “employee-store” rather than “store-employee.” Their argument fails to respect the head-final rule of tanru compounding in Lojban.
5. Hence the accurate translation is xu do pu’i zarci jibgu’a.


CoT Answer for jbo_82:
1. The selbri klama has five sumti places: x1 agent, x2 destination, x3 origin (<quote>"klama", Lojban definition: "x₁ comes/goes to destination x₂ from origin x₃ via route x₄ using means/vehicle x₅."</quote>).  
2. In standard Lojban, untagged sumti after the selbri fill the places in numeric order. Since only one sumti follows klama here, it naturally fills x2 (destination), making the sentence read “The waiter came to the left door.”  
3. Option A uses the place tag fi to overtly mark the 3rd place (<quote>"fi", Formal Language: "FA", English: "3rd sumti place", Definition: "sumti place tag: tag 3rd sumti place"</quote>). This is only necessary when you have already filled x2 and wish to jump to x3; here there is no x2 in the English, so inserting fi is unnecessary and even misleading.  
4. Option B omits fi, yielding the most natural and concise rendering (<quote>"vorme", Lojban definition: "x₁ is a doorway/gateway/access way between x₂ and x₃ of structure x₄."</quote>). Thus “lo djabei cu klama lo zunle vorme” is the idiomatic standard translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_83:
The gismu <quote>tavla: x₁ talks/speaks to x₂ about subject x₃ in language x₄</quote> makes clear that the third place (about-whom) is x₃. In our English sentence “The child is talking about dogs,” “dogs” fills x₃, not x₂. 

When we omit x₂ (the listener) and x₄ (the language), we must explicitly mark the third sumti place with the cmavo <quote>fi: 3rd sumti place tag</quote>. Without fi, the first trailing sumti is parsed as x₂ (“talks to dogs”). Thus choice (A) <quote>lo verba cu tavla lo'e gerku</quote> wrongly means “The child talks to dogs.”

By contrast, (B) <quote>lo verba cu tavla fi lo'e gerku</quote> correctly places “lo’e gerku” into x₃ (“talks about dogs”). Hence the correct translation is (B).


CoT Answer for jbo_84:
The selbri <quote>farlu: x₁ falls/drops to x₂ from x₃ in gravity well/frame of reference x₄.</quote> shows that “from the table” must fill the x₃ (origin) place of farlu.  In Lojban, a non-default sumti in the third place must be tagged by <quote>fi: … 3rd sumti place tag</quote>.  If we omit fi (as in choice B), <quote>lo jubme</quote> by default occupies x₂ (the destination), yielding “tomatoes fell to the table” rather than “from the table.”  Thus Debater_B’s position fails to respect the required place‐tagging.  The correct form is choice A, which uses <quote>fi lo jubme</quote> to mark the origin argument properly.


CoT Answer for jbo_85:
1. In Lojban, a restrictive relative clause introduced by poi must be closed with the relative‐clause terminator <quote>ku’o</quote>, not the sumti terminator <quote>ku</quote>.<quote>A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable terminator __ku'o__.</quote>

2. Debater_B’s (A) uses <quote>ku</quote> after <quote>su'o xunre</quote>. But <quote>ku</quote> only ends a sumti, not the relative clause. This means <quote>lo lolnitku'a</quote> remains inside the relative clause, yielding “ball which has spot of at-least-red from-the-cellar,” a nonsensical meaning.

3. By contrast, our (B) answer uses <quote>ku'o</quote> to close the poi-clause before introducing the basement sumti: <quote>su'o xunre ku'o lo lolnitku'a</quote>. This correctly yields: “the ball which has at least one red spot, from the basement.”

4. Additionally, when attaching a relative clause to an indefinite sumti (like lo bolci poi ...), you must place an explicit <quote>ku</quote> or <quote>ku’o</quote> to terminate the clause. The correct choice for a relative‐clause terminator is <quote>ku’o</quote>, as confirmed by:<quote>It is ungrammatical to try to place a relative clause within an indefinite sumti (that is, before an explicitly expressed terminating __ku__).</quote> Without <quote>ku’o</quote>, the basement phrase misparses as part of the restriction.

Therefore, only (B) <quote>ra cpacu lo bolci poi barna fa su'o xunre ku'o lo lolnitku'a</quote> correctly separates the red‐spot restriction from the basement location.


CoT Answer for jbo_86:
First, we are labeling a three-paragraph story as “too short.” In Lojban this involves a relative clause modifying lo lisri (the story) plus a one-word quote zo tordydu'e (“too short”).  

1.  A relative clause must be delimited by poi … <quote>ku'o</quote>.  As the grammar explains,  
   <quote>A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable terminator __ku'o__ (of selma'o KUhO).</quote>  
   Without that terminator, the clause runs on into everything that follows.  

2.  If you omit ku'o, then zo tordydu'e is parsed inside the relative clause, merging the quote into the modifier and yielding nonsense.  The grammar warns:  
   <quote>In Example 8.48, the elidable terminator __ku'o__ must appear, or the selbri of the relative clause will merge with the selbri of the description, resulting in an ungrammatical sentence.</quote>  

3.  Choice B (.ai mi seltcitygau lo lisri poi se pagbu ci jufmei ku zo tordydu'e) omits that ku'o, so the quote falls inside the poi-clause, breaking the intended scope.  

4.  Choice A (.ai mi seltcitygau lo lisri poi se pagbu ci jufmei ku'o zo tordydu'e) correctly closes the relative clause with ku'o before introducing the quote.  This preserves the top-level quote as the label of the story.  

Therefore, the correct translation is answer A.


CoT Answer for jbo_87:
In Lojban, restrictive relative clauses begin with <quote>poi</quote> and must be closed with the terminator <quote>ku'o</quote> to delimit their scope. Without closing, everything that follows remains inside the relative clause.  

First, note the definitions:  
<quote>The cmavo poi ... Definition: restrictive relative clause; attaches subordinate bridi with identifying information to a sumti.</quote>  
<quote>ku'o ... Definition: elidable terminator: end NOI relative clause; always elidable, but preferred in complex clauses.</quote>  

Second, observe Example 8.47 which shows proper use of <quote>poi</quote> with <quote>ku'o</quote>:  
<quote>Example 8.47.  
le gerku poi blabi ku'o ku cu klama vau.  
The dog which is white is going.</quote>  
Here the relative clause <quote>poi blabi</quote> is closed by <quote>ku'o</quote> before the main selbri.  

In choice (A), “do zmadu lo kajnyta'e poi se nenri lo plise ku lo ka rajycla”, the relative clause is never closed—only a single <quote>ku</quote> appears, which terminates the abstraction “lo plise ku” rather than the <quote>poi</quote> clause. This means “lo ka rajycla” is parsed as part of the relative clause, yielding nonsense.  

Choice (B) correctly uses <quote>ku'o</quote> to close the relative clause <quote>poi se nenri lo plise</quote>:  
<quote>do zmadu lo kajnyta'e poi se nenri lo plise ku'o lo ka rajycla</quote>  
Thus the comparison is properly between you and the cupboard-with-apples, on the property of tallness.  

Therefore, the correct translation is choice B.


CoT Answer for jbo_88:
We need to express sequential waiting: first on the fence, then on the roof, not simultaneous adjacency. In Lojban, connecting two separate bridi (predications) requires the sumti-connector .e plus bo for grouping with the tense, as shown in Example 10.122: <quote>la teris. satre le mlatu .ebabo le ractu</quote> (‘Terry strokes the cat and then the rabbit’). Here .e + ba + bo (.ebabo) evidently yields two predicates in sequence. By contrast, je is a tanru-internal connective used to join descriptors into one compound predicate: <quote>'je', 'Definition': 'logical connective: tanru-internal afterthought and'</quote>. Using je as in choice B would merge fence and roof into a single adjacency predicate, implying simultaneous waiting on both. Instead we must use .e to connect two full arguments: <quote>'.e', 'Definition': 'logical connective: sumti afterthought and'</quote>, giving choice A, “lo mlatu re'o lo garbi'u .e ba bo lo drudi cu denpa”, which correctly yields two waits in sequence.


CoT Answer for jbo_89:
1. We must conjoin two separate materials (wood and plastic) as sumti in the x2 place of marji.  
2. The connector “.e” links sumti, whereas “je” links brivla (tanru).
   - <quote>{'Lojban': '.e', 'English': 'sumti and', 'Definition': 'logical connective: sumti afterthought and'}</quote>
   - <quote>{'Lojban': 'je', 'English': 'tanru and', 'Definition': 'logical connective: tanru-internal afterthought and'}</quote>
3. In our sentence, “lo’e mudri .e lo’e slasi” correctly produces a single sumti meaning “wood and plastic” for the material place of marji.  
4. Using “je” instead would produce a tanru “mudri je slasi” attached to lo’e, which is inappropriate for conjoining two distinct materials in a sumti slot.  
5. Therefore, “lo me ti ckana lo’e mudri .e lo’e slasi cu marji” (choice B) is the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_90:
The correct translation must connect the two separate sumti “salt” and “pepper” as objects of dislike, not merge them into a single compound predicate. In Lojban, .e is the sumti-level “and” (<quote>'.e', 'Definition': 'logical connective: sumti afterthought and'</quote>), which yields two distinct sumti: lo'e silna and lo'e pelpeli. By contrast, je is the tanru-internal “and” (<quote>'je', 'Definition': 'logical connective: tanru-internal afterthought and'</quote>), which groups predicates into one selbri, effectively describing something that is both salt and pepper simultaneously. Debater_B’s choice B (<quote>mi lo'e silna je pelpeli cu to'e nelci</quote>) thus says “I dislike the thing which is salt-and-pepper,” not “I dislike salt and I dislike pepper.” Choice A (<quote>mi lo'e silna .e lo'e pelpeli cu to'e nelci</quote>) correctly asserts two separate sumti: “I dislike salt and I dislike pepper.” Therefore A is the right answer.


CoT Answer for jbo_91:
1. In Lojban, quantifiers like su'o and ro directly convey existential and universal scope in the order they appear.  
2. The cmavo su'o of selma'o PA “expresses inexact numbers with lower bounds” – that is, “at least one”.  For instance, <quote>mi catlu su'o re prenu</quote> means “I look at at least two persons.” (Example 18.66)  
3. The cmavo ro of selma'o PA is a universal quantifier: when it precedes a variable cmavo, it means “for every X” rather than “there exists X”.  As the grammar explains, <quote>When the variable cmavo 'da' is preceded by 'ro', the combination means 'For every X' rather than 'There is an X'.</quote> (Example 16.16)  
4. In choice (A), “lo ctuca cu punji fe su'o pinsi fi ro ci'ajbu” places su'o pinsi (∃ pencil) before fi ro ci'ajbu (∀ desk).  This reads ∃ pencil ∀ desk: the teacher put one particular pencil on every desk (the same pencil moved around).  That is not the intended English meaning.  
5. By contrast, choice (B) “lo ctuca cu punji fi ro ci'ajbu fe su'o pinsi” places fi ro ci'ajbu (∀ desk) before fe su'o pinsi (∃ pencil).  This reads ∀ desk ∃ pencil: for each desk, there is some pencil put on it – exactly matching “The teacher put a pencil on every desk.”  
6. Therefore the correct translation is (B), since it preserves the intended ∀∃ scope of “every desk” then “a pencil.”


CoT Answer for jbo_92:
In Lojban, the order of quantifier cmavo critically determines scope. As shown in the background:
<quote>Example 16.18. ro da de zo'u da viska de…Everything sees something.</quote>
and
<quote>Example 16.19. da ro de zo'u da viska de…Something sees everything.</quote>
Here, swapping the positions of ro (“each/all”) and da (“something”) reverses the meaning from a universal–existential claim to an existential–universal one.  

In our choices, A is:
 xu su'o da ro gugde pu'i stuvi'e  
which places the existential su'o da (“at least one person”) before the universal ro gugde (“every country”), yielding “Is there at least one person who can-and-has visited every country?”  

By contrast, B is:
 xu ro gugde su'o da pu'i se stuvi'e  
which places ro gugde first and then su'o da, yielding “Does every country have at least one person who can-and-has visited it?” — i.e. “Has each country been visited by somebody?”  

The English question “Has anybody visited every country?” asks whether a single person exists who has visited all countries, matching A’s existential–universal structure.  Therefore, A correctly captures the intended meaning, while B misplaces the quantifiers and yields a different statement.


CoT Answer for jbo_93:
1. In Lojban, ro is the universal quantifier “for every” and su'o is the existential quantifier “at least one.”  Their order determines scope.  <quote>ro da zo'u da viska mi</quote> shows that placing ro before the variable makes it a universal claim, and <quote>mi catlu su'o re prenu</quote> shows that su'o before a number yields an existential claim.

2. Translation (A) mipri su'o jai se ckeji fa ro remna puts su'o (“at least one secret”) outside the scope of ro remna – it first picks a secret and then claims that every human keeps that same secret.  This mismatches the English, which requires each human to have its own (possibly different) secret.

3. In contrast, (B) ro remna cu mipri su'o jai se ckeji correctly scopes the universal over humans first, then for each human asserts the existence of at least one embarrassing secret.  This matches “Every human has at least one embarrassing secret.”

4. Debater_B overlooked that reversing quantifiers swaps the meaning (existential over secret vs. universal over human).  Only (B) places ro on remna, then mipri su'o … to express per-human existence of a secret.

Therefore, the correct translation is answer B: ro remna cu mipri su'o jai se ckeji.


CoT Answer for jbo_94:
1. In Lojban grammar, every simple bridi (predicate sentence) with at least one sumti before the selbri normally requires the cmavo “cu” to mark the beginning of the selbri.  
2. As the background defines, “cu” is a “selbri separator” whose purpose is to “separate selbri from preceding sumti” (<quote>"cu": "selbri separator", "Definition": "elidable marker: separates selbri from preceding sumti"</quote>).  Without it, the parser does not know where the sumti ends and the selbri begins.  
3. Debater_B’s proposal (<quote>lo labno cmoni ze'u lo nicte</quote>) omits “cu”, causing “lo labno cmoni” to be parsed as a single sumti rather than as “lo labno” (sumti) + “cmoni” (selbri).  In particular, gismu like “cmoni” can form part of a sumti when preceded by “lo”, so you end up with “the ones who howl” as a noun phrase, and no main predicate remains for the bridi.  
4. By contrast, choice A (“lo labno cu cmoni ze'u lo nicte”) clearly marks “cmoni” as the selbri:  “lo labno” is the x1 sumti, “cmoni” is the bridi ‘howl’, “ze'u” is the temporal interval ‘long time’, and “lo nicte” is the x2 sumti ‘the night’.  This matches the intended English: “The wolves howled long during the night.”  
5. Therefore, only A correctly reflects standard Lojban structure, and B fails to provide a valid selbri-marker.


CoT Answer for jbo_95:
Debater_B’s proposal <quote>lo cukta se pagbu 361 papri</quote> fails because it omits the selbri separator “cu”, leaving no main predicate in the bridi.  According to the background, <quote>cu … elidable marker: separates selbri from preceding sumti, allows preceding terminator elision</quote>.  Without “cu”, “se pagbu” cannot function as the sentence’s selbri and instead is parsed as part of the initial sumti descriptor <quote>lo cukta se pagbu</quote>.  Moreover, “se pagbu” is a converted selbri, since <quote>se … Definition: 2nd conversion; switch 1st/2nd places</quote>, so it must be explicitly marked as the main predicate.  In (B) <quote>lo cukta cu se pagbu 361 papri</quote>, “cu” correctly marks “se pagbu” as the selbri, and “361 papri” occupies its x2 place, yielding the intended meaning “The book has 361 pages.”  Therefore (B) is the proper translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_96:
1. A well-formed Lojban bridi must consist of one or more sumti, the selbri, and any selbri modifiers (e.g. <quote>di'a</quote>). 2. In “xu lo tuple be do cu kanro di'a” (A), “lo tuple be do” is the sumti (“the legs of you”), <quote>"cu" is the selbri separator: separates selbri from preceding sumti, allows preceding terminator elision</quote>, and “kanro” is the selbri (“are healthy”), followed by the aspect marker “di'a” (“resumptive”). 3. In contrast, option B “xu lo tuple be do kanro di'a” omits “cu”, so “kanro” remains inside the sumti chain and no selbri is marked, yielding an incomplete bridi with no main predicate. 4. Thus only A correctly parses as a question meaning “Are your legs healthy now?” in standard Lojban.


CoT Answer for jbo_97:
1. The gismu cpedu has the place structure “x1 requests/asks … for x2 of/from x3 in manner/form x4.” <quote>The following definitions pulled from the above background may be particularly useful: {'Lojban': 'cpedu', 'Lojban definition': 'x_{1} requests/asks/petitions/solicits for x_{2} of/from x_{3} in manner/form x_{4}.'}</quote>

2. In unmarked word order, sumti after the selbri fill x2, x3, etc., in sequence. To swap x2 and x3, we must use FA-place tags fe (for x2) and fi (for x3). <quote>The five cmavo fa, fe, fi, fo, and fu may be inserted just before the sumti in the x1 to x5 places respectively</quote>

3. Option A (xu do lo vecnu cu cpedu lo ka jdimyjdikygau) places “lo vecnu” as x2 and “lo ka jdimyjdikygau” as x3, i.e. “ask for the seller from the discount,” reversing the intended roles.

4. Option B (xu do fi lo vecnu cu cpedu fe lo ka jdimyjdikygau) correctly uses <quote>fi</quote> to mark lo vecnu as x3 (the seller) and <quote>fe</quote> to mark lo ka jdimyjdikygau as x2 (the discount), matching “Have you asked the seller (x3) for a discount (x2)?”

5. Therefore the only correct translation is option B.


CoT Answer for jbo_98:
1. The cmavo kucli (‘be curious about’) takes a predication-abstract (du’u) as its sumti.  Section 11.7 gives the example:
<quote>mi kucli le du'u la frank. cu bebna [kei]</quote>
→ “I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.”

2.  For an indirect question one must use kau inside the du’u clause.  Section 11.8 illustrates:
<quote>mi djuno le du'u ma kau pu klama le zarci</quote>
→ “I know who went to the store.”

3.  Answer A mirrors this exact pattern:
   mi kucli lo du'u ma kau ni glare ca lo bavlamdei
   “I’m curious how hot it will be tomorrow.”

4.  By contrast, Answer B uses <quote>lo ni glare ca lo bavlamdei</quote>, which is an amount abstraction.  As defined in Section 11.5:
<quote>_ _ni_ _ x1 is the amount of (the bridi) on scale x2</quote>
This yields a bare numerical sumti (the amount of hotness), not a proposition—and so cannot serve as kucli’s argument.  

Therefore only A is grammatical and faithful to the intended meaning.


CoT Answer for jbo_99:
1. In Lojban tanru (compound predicates), the second element is the head (the modificand) and so governs the place structure and arguments.  
2. The gismu definitions show that kakne has place structure x1 = agent, x2 = action (selbri), and pensi has x1 = thinker, x2 = thought:  
   - <quote>x₁ is able to do/be/capable of doing/being x₂ (event/state) under conditions x₃ (event/state).</quote>  
   - <quote>x₁ thinks/considers/cogitates/reasons/is pensive about/reflects upon subject/concept x₂.</quote>  
3. In sentence (A) “xu kakne pensi fa lo’e manti”, the tanru is kakne pensi, so pensi is the head.  That makes “lo’e manti” fill x1 of pensi (“the typical ants think”), yielding “Do ants think in a capable way?” rather than “Can ants think?”  
4. In contrast, sentence (B) “xu pensi kakne fa lo’e manti” forms the tanru pensi kakne, so kakne is the head.  Then “lo’e manti” is x1 of kakne (“are ants capable of …”), and the action x2 is ‘pensi’ (“to think”).  Thus B correctly asks “Are ants able to think?”  
5. Therefore the proper translation is B.


CoT Answer for jbo_100:
1. In Lojban, when two gismu occur together as a tanru, “the first modifies the second.” <quote>“When two gismu are adjacent, the first one modifies the second, and the selbri takes its place structure from the rightmost word.”</quote>

2. The place structure of a tanru is always that of its final component. <quote>“The place structure of a tanru is always that of the final component of the tanru.”</quote>

3. In choice A, “do sutra zmadu lo drata,” the tanru is “sutra zmadu.” “sutra” (fast) modifies “zmadu” (exceeds), so the selbri is zmadu with x₃ = speed. The sentence literally says “You exceed the others in speed,” exactly matching “You’re faster than the others.”

4. In choice B, “do zmadu sutra lo drata,” the tanru would be “zmadu sutra,” so “zmadu” (exceeds) modifies “sutra” (fast). The selbri becomes “sutra,” yielding “You are a fast type of ‘exceeding’ the others,” which does not convey “faster than the others.” It misplaces the property argument.

5. Therefore A correctly places zmadu as the main predicate with the property sutra, giving the intended meaning.


CoT Answer for jbo_101:
1. The core meaning of the English sentence is that the police “caused” us to perform the event of undressing, not that they “built” or “manufactured” an object.  In Lojban, causing an event is expressed by the gismu <quote>gasnu: “x1 [person/agent] is an agentive cause of event x2; x1 does/brings about x2.”</quote>

2. By contrast, <quote>zbasu: “x1 makes/assembles/builds/manufactures/creates x2 out of materials/parts/components x3.”</quote> is strictly for producing or constructing things from material components (like buildings or artifacts), not for instigating actions.

3. The sentence uses an event abstraction “lo nu mi’a co’u dasni su’o da” (“the event of our having ceased wearing something”—i.e., undressing”).  We need a selbri that selects the agentive CAUSE of that event, which is precisely <quote>gasnu</quote>, not <quote>zbasu</quote>.

4. Therefore the correct translation is:
   lo pulji cu gasnu lo nu mi’a co’u dasni su’o da
   (“The police caused the event of our undressing.”)

Debater_B’s suggestion to use <quote>zbasu</quote> is incorrect because it would read as “the police *built* or *manufactured* the event,” which is nonsensical given zbasu’s material-creation semantics.


CoT Answer for jbo_102:
To state “a litre of water” we must use the gismu <quote>litce</quote>, which is defined as <quote>'x1 is x2 liter(s) [metric unit] in volume (default is 1) by standard x3.'</quote> In Lojban, the number-of-litres (x2) is supplied by <quote>li</quote> (“the number”), not by linking with <quote>be</quote>. Sentence A, “mi pinxe su'o djacu poi litce li pa”, uses <quote>poi</quote> (“restrictive relative clause; attaches subordinate bridi with identifying information to a sumti”) to say “some water which is one litre”. This correctly means “I drank one litre of water.” By contrast, sentence B, “mi pinxe pa litce be lo'e djacu”, uses <quote>be</quote> (“sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri; used in descriptions”) and <quote>lo'e</quote> (“the typical one(s) who really is(are) …”) to attach water as the standard of measurement (x3) rather than as the object measured (x1), and omits <quote>li</quote> to convert the digit. That yields a nonsensical “one-litre-thing whose standard is the typical water.” Only A correctly expresses “I drank a litre of water.”


CoT Answer for jbo_103:
We need the sumti “lo mamta be do” (your mother) to serve as both the recipient of <quote>dunda</quote> (giving) and the source of <quote>lebna</quote> (taking).  In Lojban compound bridi, gi’e connects two bridi‐tails, and any sumti following a terminating VAU become tail‐terms applying to both predicates.  As the grammar explains:<quote>Giheks connect two bridi-tails, but also allow sumti to be added following the bridi-tail. These sumti are known as tail-terms, and apply to both bridi.</quote>  Furthermore, VAU is required to separate the second bridi-tail from its tail-terms so they don’t attach only to the second selbri:<quote>The __vau__ … serves to separate the bridi-tail from the tail-terms.</quote>  Option B correctly uses VAU before <quote>lo mamta be do</quote>, making “your mother” the argument of both <quote>dunda</quote> and <quote>lebna</quote>, exactly matching “give a painting to your mother and take some soap from her.”  Option A omits VAU, so <quote>lo mamta be do</quote> would attach only to <quote>lebna</quote>, leaving the giver’s recipient unspecified or relying on default context, which fails to render “to your mother” unambiguously.  Therefore the correct translation is B.


CoT Answer for jbo_104:
1. The English sentence “The door is easy, but the window isn’t” asserts two parallel properties: “doing the door” is easy, and “doing the window” is not easy.  In Lojban, such parallelism of raised abstractions requires forethought logical connectives <quote>'ge' ... 'gi'</quote> to join two <quote>'tu'a'</quote> phrases.  2. The cmavo <quote>'tu'a'</quote> raises an abstract sumti to the main bridi level: “some‐action‐to‐do‐with the door,” and similarly for the window.  As the background explains, <quote>“The relevant cmavo is __tu'a__, which belongs to selma'o LAhE. ... The term ‘sumti‐raising’ signifies that a sumti which logically belongs within an abstraction ... is ‘raised’ to the main bridi level.”</quote> 3. Forethought logical connectives are mandatory to parallel two <quote>'tu'a'</quote> phrases; the example <quote>“mi ge klama le zarci gi nelci la djan.”</quote> shows that <quote>'ge'</quote> before and <quote>'gi'</quote> between join two sentences into one bridi‐tail.  4. Choice B instead uses the afterthought sumti connective <quote>'.e'</quote> and places <quote>'nai'</quote> and <quote>'ku ku'i'</quote> incorrectly between sumti, failing to connect two abstracted actions as parallel cases and misplacing the contrastive <quote>'ku'i'</quote>.  5. By contrast, sentence A, <quote>frili fa ge tu'a lo vorme gi nai ku'i tu'a lo canko</quote>, correctly reads “It is easy to do the door both (ge) and not to do the window,” faithfully rendering “The door is easy, but the window isn't.”


CoT Answer for jbo_105:
1. In Lojban, the resumptive aspect marker <quote>di'a</quote> must directly precede the selbri (verb), not follow a quantified sumti.  For example, the background gives:
   <quote>mi ba di'a citka le mi sanmi</quote>
   “I will resume eating my meal.”
   Here <quote>di'a</quote> immediately precedes the selbri <quote>citka</quote>.

2. The quantifier <quote>su'o</quote> (‘at least one’) attaches to the sumti that follows it, as shown in:
   <quote>mi catlu su'o re prenu</quote>
   “I look at at least two persons.”
   Similarly, <quote>su'o ratcu</quote> means “at least one rat.”

3. In sentence (A) <quote>xu do su'o ratcu di'a kurji</quote>, the quantifier <quote>su'o</quote> would scope over <quote>ratcu</quote> before the resumptive <quote>di'a</quote>, yielding “Is there at least one rat that you resume caring for (the same rat as before)?”  That fails to capture the English “Do you have pet rats again?”

4. In contrast, (B) <quote>xu do di'a kurji su'o ratcu</quote> correctly places the resumptive aspect <quote>di'a</quote> before the verb <quote>kurji</quote>, and only then quantifies the object: “Is it again the case that you take care of at least one rat?”  This matches “Do you have pet rats again?”

Therefore, the correct translation is choice B.


CoT Answer for jbo_106:
1. The English sentence contains two separate clauses—(1) “The beetles haven’t yet matured” and (2) “the reason being that I haven’t separated them from each other.” In Lojban, we must isolate the unrealized-potential aspect <quote>“nu'o” is modal aspect: can but has not; unrealized potential</quote> so that it applies only to “makcu” (mature), not to the causal explanation.<br>2. Choice (A) does this by writing <quote>lo cakcinki nu'o makcu .i ki'u bo ri nu'o gau mi sepsi'u</quote>. Here <quote>“.i”</quote> splits the two bridi, and <quote>“bo”</quote> ensures <quote>“ki'u”</quote> runs only with the second clause—so “nu'o” scopes correctly over “makcu” alone.<br>3. In contrast, (B) omits both <quote>“.i”</quote> and <quote>“bo”</quote>:<br><quote>lo cakcinki nu'o makcu ki'u lo nu ri nu'o gau mi sepsi'u</quote><br>This lets <quote>“nu'o”</quote> wrongly absorb the entire reason clause, as shown by the background’s caution: <quote>If the __bo__ were omitted … the modal becomes a sumti … the translation must be changed</quote> (Example 9.43).<br>4. Therefore, only (A) correctly matches “haven’t yet matured” with a restricted <quote>“nu'o makcu”</quote> and places the causal connective <quote>“ki'u”</quote> outside its scope, giving the intended meaning. Choice (A) is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_107:
To capture “I chose to do what was easiest for me,” we use zu’ejdi (x1 decides to do x2) with a ka‐abstraction of the chosen action’s property:<quote>ka: abstractor: property/quality abstractor (-ness); x1 is quality/property exhibited by [bridi]</quote>. Inside that abstraction we must describe “the thing easy for me.”  

frilyrai is a two‐place lujvo meaning “x1 is easy for x2,” and we attach the me-sumti mi into its x2 place using be:<quote>be: sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri; used in descriptions</quote>.  Thus “lo frilyrai be fi mi” unambiguously means “the thing which is easy for me.”  

By contrast, inserting se before frilyrai swaps its x1 and x2:<quote>se: 2nd conversion; switch 1st/2nd places</quote>.  “lo se frilyrai be fi mi” would then yield a description whose x1 is mi (the person) and whose x2 is the thing, i.e. “the person for whom something is easy,” which does not match “the thing easiest for me.”  

Therefore the correct translation is B:  
mi zu’ejdi lo ka zukte lo frilyrai be fi mi


CoT Answer for jbo_108:
1. The sentence “It’s common to fight with one’s parents” requires a unary property abstraction: a single variable X such that X fights with X’s parents.  
2. In standard Lojban, <quote>ce'u</quote> introduces a single abstraction variable, and if you need to refer to the same variable again, you must use an anaphoric pronoun like <quote>ri</quote> rather than a second <quote>ce'u</quote>.  As the text explains,  
   <quote>It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction.</quote>  
   Using two <quote>ce'u</quote>’s (as in choice B) thus creates two independent variables, yielding a binary relation instead of the required unary property.  
3. By contrast, <quote>ri</quote> reliably repeats the single variable focus introduced by <quote>ce'u</quote>.  The text states,  
   <quote>The cmavo __ri__ is the simplest of these; it has the same referent as the last complete sumti appearing before the __ri__.</quote>  
4. Therefore, choice A,  
   zilfadni fa lo ka ce'u damba lo rirni be ri  
correctly binds one variable <quote>ce'u</quote> for “the fighter” and uses <quote>ri</quote> to refer back to that same fighter as parent: “it’s common for someone (ce’u) to fight with that someone’s parents (rirni be ri).”  Choice B misbinds by using <quote>ce'u</quote> twice, yielding two distinct variables and failing to express a unary predicate.  
5. Hence the correct translation is choice A.


CoT Answer for jbo_109:
1. In Lojban, the cmavo <quote>be</quote> is used to attach the following sumti as the selbri’s second place (x2) argument: <quote>Definition: sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri; used in descriptions</quote>.  
2. The gismu <quote>nazbi</quote> has the place structure “x1 is the nose of x2,” i.e. x2 is the owner of the nose: <quote>x1 is the nose [body-part] of x2 with nostril(s)/nasal passage(s) x3; [metaphor: protrusion].</quote>  
3. The gismu <quote>xunre</quote> then predicates that its x1 is red: <quote>x1 is red/crimson/ruddy [color adjective].</quote>  
4. Therefore, the phrase “lo nazbi be lo .ekcala” correctly means “the nose (nazbi) whose x2 (possessor) is the clown (.ekcala),” and <quote>cu xunre</quote> asserts “is red.” This matches “The clown’s nose is red.”  
5. By contrast, “lo .ekcala be lo nazbi” would make “.ekcala” (clown) the selbri, attaching “lo nazbi” (the nose) as its x2. That yields “the clown-of-the-nose” (or “a clown that has a nose”), which does not express “the nose of the clown.” Furthermore, “.ekcala” as a selbri does not semantically expect x2 to be a nose.  
6. Debater_B’s proposal (A) therefore misuses <quote>be</quote> by reversing selbri and sumti, making the sentence nonsensical for “The clown’s nose is red.” Only option B correctly links the clown as the possessor of the nose, then predicates redness.


CoT Answer for jbo_110:
1. The English phrase “as soon as” is expressed in Lojban by the event‐contour cmavo co’a as a preposition before the event abstraction. As explained in the grammar: <quote>The cmavo co’a marks the boundary between the pu’o and ca’o parts of an event, indicating its initiation.</quote> Thus we need co’a directly before the nu‐abstraction for “they finished cooking.”  

2. The event “they finished cooking” must be expressed as a nu‐abstraction with the completive aspect mo’u on the selbri jukpa, wrapped by lo to pick out the real event.  As the grammar states: <invalid_quote>The cmavo mo’u marks the natural completion of an event (completive).</invalid_quote>  And: <quote>The place structure of a nu abstraction selbri is: x1 is an event of [the bridi].</quote>

3. Translation (A) correctly combines these pieces:  
   • do gleki — “You are happy”  
   • co’a lo nu ra mo’u jukpa — “as soon as the event of their having completed cooking.”  
   The structure co’a lo nu ra mo’u jukpa places co’a as a preposition before the nu‐abstraction, and mo’u immediately before the selbri jukpa, exactly matching the examples.

4. By contrast, (B) inserts ku right after co’a: “do gleki co’a ku mo’u lo nu ra jukpa”.  But ku is only a terminator for descriptor sumti like lo … ku, not for a tense/modifier cmavo. Here there is no matching lo before that ku, so the sentence is syntactically invalid. Moreover, mo’u ends up modifying the entire descriptor rather than the selbri jukpa, mis‐scoping the completive aspect.  

Therefore the only faithful translation is (A) do gleki co’a lo nu ra mo’u jukpa.


CoT Answer for jbo_111:
1. The Lojban gismu <quote>troci</quote> has the place structure “x1 tries/attempts/makes an effort to do/attain x2”, so the event x2 must follow <quote>troci</quote> as its second argument (the thing being tried).  
2. The lujvo <quote>nerkla</quote> means “to enter”.  In our sentence, the mosquitoes (lo ckuliki) are x1 of <quote>troci</quote>, and the event “enter” (nerkla) is x2.  
3. Because in Lojban the selbri comes before its sumti arguments, we must place <quote>troci</quote> first and then the event noun <quote>nerkla</quote> as its x2: <quote>cu troci nerkla</quote>.  
4. A head-final tanru principle requires the main selbri (troci) to precede its specifier (nerkla) when the specifier functions as a tail-sumti, yielding the natural reading “they tried entry” = “they tried to get inside.”  
5. Reversing the order to <quote>cu nerkla troci</quote> would treat <quote>nerkla</quote> as the selbri and <quote>troci</quote> as its sumti, resulting in “they entered with effort” rather than “they tried to enter.”  
6. Therefore the correct translation is choice B: ze'a lo nicte lo ckuliki cu nerkla troci.


CoT Answer for jbo_112:
1. We begin by parsing the intended Lojban sentence: “Prisoners, you may now sleep.” This consists of a vocative phrase “doi pinfu do” (“O prisoners, you”) followed by the bridi “ca sipna” (“are sleeping now” / “sleep now”) and then the permission attitudinal “.e'a” (“I permit”).

2. In choice A, the attitudinal comes after the bridi: “doi pinfu do ca sipna .e'a”. This correctly attaches permission to the predicate “do ca sipna” (you sleep now), yielding “You prisoners, you may now sleep.”

3. In choice B, “doi pinfu .e'a do ca sipna”, the attitudinal sits inside the vocative phrase. That placement would attach permission to “pinfu” (prisoner) rather than to the act of sleeping:
   • It would read something like “O, prisoners whom I permit, you now sleep,” confusing the grant of permission as a modifier of ‘prisoner’ rather than of the sleeping event.

4. Support from the background definitions:
   • <quote>".e'a", ... "English": "permission", "Definition": "attitudinal: granting permission - prohibiting"</quote> shows that .e'a is an attitudinal cmavo expressing permission.
   • <quote>"The purpose of a vocative phrase is to indicate who is being addressed ... A vocative phrase begins with a cmavo of selma'o COI or DOI ... Vocative phrases are not sumti, but are explained in this chapter because their syntax is very similar to that of sumti."</quote> (section-vocative-syntax.txt) establishes that vocative phrases are free modifiers.

5. Free modifiers (including attitudinals) in Lojban always attach to the immediately preceding word or phrase. By placing .e'a after “ca sipna” (as in A), we ensure it modifies the bridi “do ca sipna”. In B, .e'a improperly modifies the vocative “doi pinfu”.

6. Therefore, the correct translation must be choice A: “doi pinfu do ca sipna .e'a.”

1. The critical distinction is between lo and loi. As defined in the background:
   <quote>{'Lojban': 'lo', 'English': 'the really is', 'Definition': 'veridical descriptor: the one(s) that really is(are) ...'}</quote>
   <quote>{'Lojban': 'loi', 'English': 'the mass really is', 'Definition': 'veridical descriptor: the mass of individual(s) that is(are) ...'}</quote>
   “lo” picks out individual(s) satisfying the predicate; “loi” picks out the mass (set) of such individuals.

2. In English “One of the couples” quantifies over the set of all couples. We want to say “one from the mass of couples.” “pa loi spenysi'u” does exactly that: it says “one (pa) out of the mass (loi) of things that really are spouses (spenysi'u).” By contrast, “pa lo spenysi'u” would simply pick one arbitrary spouse-individual, not one of the couples-as-a-group.

3. The construction “se krasi lo morkygu'e” correctly expresses “is from Morocco.” From the gismu definition:
   <quote>{'Lojban': 'krasi', 'English': '- source; origin', 'Lojban definition': 'x1 (site/event) is a source/start/beginning/origin of x2 ...'}</quote>
   Applying the 2nd-place conversion <quote>{'Lojban': 'se', 'Definition': '2nd conversion; switch 1st/2nd places'}</quote> yields a selbri whose x1 is “origin.” Thus “se krasi lo morkygu'e” = “originates from Morocco.”

4. Debater_B’s argument fails to account for the need to quantify over the set of couples rather than pick a single individual spouse. They claimed “lo” would suffice, but that ignores the mass‐descriptor role of <quote>loi</quote>. Using <quote>loi</quote> ensures we are quantifying over the group “couples,” matching the English semantics. 

Therefore, the correct translation is B: “pa loi spenysi'u cu se krasi lo morkygu'e.”

CoT Answer for jbo_115:
1. In Lojban, <quote>“pe'u” ... “Please, X”; indicates a request to the listener.</quote> This shows that pe'u is a vocative cmavo that must directly precede its addressee.  
2. In option A, pe'u ti vajni, the sequence pe'u ti makes “this” the listener: it reads “Please, this! It is important.” That is not the intended meaning, since we do not want to address “this” as if it were the person being spoken to.  
3. By contrast, option B, ti vajni pe'u, puts pe'u after the bridi with no sumti following it. As the background explains, <quote>a vocative may be followed by ... nothing at all (if the addressee is obvious)</quote>, so pe'u here politely addresses the actual listener (the hearer), yielding “This is important, please.”  
4. Debater_B’s argument for A misassigns the scope of pe'u, treating it like an adverbial rather than a true vocative. The correct placement is sentence-final in B, making ti vajni pe'u the proper translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_116:
Debater_B’s translation (B) omits any grouping around the fraction, wrongly assuming Lojban will apply the usual mathematical precedence. In fact, <quote>By default, Lojban mathematics is like simple calculator mathematics: there is no notion of “operator precedence”.</quote> As the text explains, <quote>VUhU operators by default are done left to right, like other Lojban grouping</quote>. Thus “li re su'i pa fe'i mu” would be evaluated as (2 + 1) / 5 = 3/5, not the intended 2 + (1/5). To force the correct grouping of one-fifth as a single operand, Lojban requires parentheses: <quote>__vei__ and __ve'o__, which can be used just like their written equivalents “(” and “)” to group expressions in any way desired:</quote> In our translation, “vei pa fe'i mu” brackets 1 divided by 5, yielding 2 + (1/5). The closing marker __ve'o__ is optional at the end, since <quote>Note that __ve'o__ (the right parenthesis) is an elidable terminator.</quote> Therefore the proper standard Lojban sentence is A: “li pa pa fe'i mu du li re su'i vei pa fe'i mu.”


CoT Answer for jbo_117:
1. The gismu <quote>djica</quote> requires its x2 place to be an event or state, not merely a property: <quote>x₁ desires/wants/wishes x₂ (event/state) for purpose x₃.</quote>
2. In sentence A, Debater_B uses a property abstraction with <quote>lo ka lo stuna mlana cu stuzi</quote>, which yields a property (a quality) of the door being on the east side, not an event of it being so placed.
3. To satisfy <quote>djica</quote>’s requirement for an event, we must package up the situation “the door is on the east side” as an abstract event, using <quote>nu</quote>: <quote>x₁ is an event of (the bridi).</quote>
4. Hence the correct translation is B: <quote>ra djica lo nu lo vorme lo stuna mlana cu se stuzi</quote>, literally “She wants the event that the door is on the east side (to occur).”
5. Sentence A conflates property abstraction (<quote>ka</quote>) with event, making its object ineligible for <quote>djica</quote>’s event-seeking x2 place. B correctly uses <quote>nu</quote> to meet that requirement.


CoT Answer for jbo_118:
The English sentence is speaking about the word “pot” itself and saying that in the second sentence that word should instead be “cup.”  In Lojban, when you talk about a word as a word, you must quote it with <quote>zo</quote>, not use <quote>lo</quote>, which would refer to actual objects.  As the grammar text states, <quote>“zo” is a strong quotation mark for the single following word, which can be any Lojban word whatsoever.</quote>  Therefore we must write <quote>zo patxu</quote> to refer to the word “pot,” and likewise <quote>zo kabri</quote> to refer to the word “cup.”  Option B’s <quote>lo kabri</quote> would refer to an actual cup rather than the word “cup,” which contradicts the intent.  Hence the correct translation is A.


CoT Answer for jbo_119:
1. The gismu <quote>birti: x₁ is certain/sure/positive/convinced that x₂ is true.</quote> shows that birti’s second argument must be a proposition (a bridi), not a noun phrase.  
2. Choice (A) uses <quote>lo junta be lo sfofa</quote> as birti’s x₂, which names the weight of the couch rather than asserting any proposition.  One cannot be “certain” of a mere object description.  
3. By contrast, (B) wraps the indirect question in a bridi abstraction: <quote>le du'u ma kau junta lo sfofa</quote>.  The <quote>du'u</quote> abstracts a predication, and <quote>kau</quote> marks an indirect question, as explained: <quote>To express indirect questions in Lojban, we use a _le du'u_ abstraction ... and mark it with the suffix particle __kau__</quote>.  
4. Therefore (B) correctly supplies birti’s x₂ with a true proposition—“how heavy the couch is”—making "mi na'e birti lo du'u ma kau junta lo sfofa" the proper translation of “I’m not sure how heavy the couch is.”


CoT Answer for jbo_120:
1. The English sentence “Nobody is perfect” asserts that the number of people who are perfect is zero.  
2. In Lojban, “no prenu” literally means “zero persons,” as defined: <quote>'no', Formal Language: 'PA1', English: '0', Definition: 'digit/number: 0 (digit) [zero]'</quote>.  
3. The particle <quote>'cu'</quote> is required to separate the sumti from the selbri: <quote>'Definition': 'elidable marker: separates selbri from preceding sumti, allows preceding terminator elision'</quote>.  
4. The selbri “prane” means “is perfect,” so “no prenu cu prane” directly states “zero persons are perfect,” i.e. “nobody is perfect.”  
5. Option B, “no prenu na prane,” incorrectly inserts <quote>'na', Definition: 'bridi contradictory negator; scope is an entire bridi; logically negates in some cmavo compounds'</quote>. This negates the entire bridi “no prenu cu prane,” yielding “it is false that zero persons are perfect,” which logically implies “there is at least one perfect person” — the exact opposite of “nobody is perfect.”  
6. Therefore, A is the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_121:
We need two separate predicates: “sutra lo ka co’a cilmo” (‘quickly begins to get wet’) and “ku’i masno lo ka co’a sudga” (‘but slowly begins to dry’), connected by gi’e. To keep the property-abstraction tags from swallowing the rest of the sentence, the ka-phrase must be explicitly closed with ku, not with vau.  

1. “ka” opens a property-abstraction sumti which must be closed by “ku” (not “vau”). As defined, <quote>‘ka’: property abstractor</quote>, and <quote>‘ku’: elidable terminator: end description … sumti</quote>.  Without ku, the abstraction spans past the gi’e and absorbs the drying clause.  

2. By contrast, “vau” marks end of a bridi or bridi-tail: <quote>‘vau’: end simple bridi … separates common trailing sumti</quote>.  Using vau after the ka-clause (as in A) incorrectly terminates the whole bridi rather than the abstraction sumti.  

3. B correctly writes “lo ka co’a cilmo ku” to close the abstraction, then continues “gi’e ku’i masno lo ka co’a sudga” as a separate bridi-tail.  

Therefore the proper translation is B, with ku closing the ka-sumti.


CoT Answer for jbo_122:
1. In Lojban, we must clearly terminate a sumti (argument phrase) with <quote>ku ... end description, modal, or negator sumti; often elidable</quote> so that any following discourse operators apply to the main bridi rather than to the sumti itself.  
2. The discursive <quote>ji'a</quote> is an instance of UI3b, which, as explained, when placed at the beginning of a bridi applies to the entire bridi, and when placed elsewhere attaches only to the immediately preceding word.  
3. In choice A, <quote>lo'e se cnino ku ji'a zanvi'e</quote>, the <quote>ku</quote> closes the sumti “lo’e se cnino” (the typical beginner), so that <quote>ji'a</quote> truly modifies the main predicate <quote>zanvi’e</quote> (“is welcomed”) to mean “Beginners are welcome, too.”  
4. By contrast, in choice B, <quote>lo'e se cnino ji'a ku zanvi'e</quote>, the <quote>ji'a</quote> precedes the terminator <quote>ku</quote>, so it attaches to <quote>se cnino</quote> and yields “those who are also beginners,” implying “those who are welcome are also beginners,” which inverts the intended emphasis.  
5. Therefore, only option A correctly renders “Beginners are welcome too” by ensuring the addition marker modifies the predicate rather than the description.


CoT Answer for jbo_123:
We want to translate “Those who mainly hope usually fail.” Here “mainly” corresponds to the discursive ra’u, which must modify the selbri pacna (“hope”). In Lojban, modifiers that apply to the sumti must appear before the sumti’s terminator ku. 

1. Ra’u meaning “chiefly/primarily” belongs to the discourse-management group and modifies whichever clause it attaches to. As the background explains,  
   <quote>The scale of ra'u has to do with the importance of the point being, or about to be, expressed: ra'u is the most important point.</quote>  
   We need ra’u to modify pacna, not fliba.  

2. The cmavo ku is the elidable terminator that ends a description sumti:  
   <quote>ku: end description, modal, or negator sumti; often elidable.</quote>  
   Anything after ku is outside the descriptor’s sumti. Thus placing ra’u after ku (as in choice A) attaches “mainly” to fliba (“fail”) rather than to pacna.  

3. Choice B, lo'e pacna ra'u ku fliba ta'e, correctly puts ra’u before ku, so it qualifies pacna (“those who mainly hope”). After the ku, we have fliba ta’e (“fail habitually”). This matches “those who mainly hope usually fail.”  

Therefore the correct translation is B: lo'e pacna ra'u ku fliba ta'e.


CoT Answer for jbo_124:
1. The English sentence “We all care for each other” means “the speaker and listener together, each of whom cares for every other in that group.”  
2. In Lojban, mi'o is the pro-sumti “you and I” as a mass: <quote>The cmavo mi'o includes only the speaker and the listener but no one else; ... All of these pro-sumti represent masses. For example, mi'o is the same as mi joi do, the mass of me and you considered jointly.</quote>  
3. ro is the universal quantifier “for every X”: <quote>When the variable cmavo da is preceded by ro, the combination means “For every X” rather than “There is an X.”</quote>  
4. To express “you and I, each of whom cares for each other,” we need lo to turn mi'o into “the group {me and you},” and then ro attached inside the predicate position to kurjysi'u, so that it quantifies within that group.  In choice B, lo mi'o ro kurjysi'u parses as:  
   • lo mi'o – “the set of speaker and listener,”  
   • ro kurjysi'u – “for each one in that set, (they) care for each other.”  
5. By contrast, choice A (lo ro mi'o kurjysi'u) parses as lo [ro mi'o] kurjysi'u, i.e. “the group of every ‘me-and-you’ that care,” which misplaces ro and does not yield the intended meaning.  
6. Therefore the correct, unambiguous translation is “lo mi'o ro kurjysi'u.”
