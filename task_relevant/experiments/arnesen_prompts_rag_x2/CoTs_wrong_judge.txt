CoT Answer for jbo_7:
Debater_A cites two <quote>…</quote> passages showing that cu is elidable and “never strictly necessary.” Debater_B’s only quote just defines cu’s function but doesn’t claim it’s mandatory. Without evidence that omission causes ungrammaticality, the default is that cu can be dropped when unambiguous. Thus choice A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_11:
Debater_A backs x₁/x₂ roles with an explicit quote (<quote>x₁ satisfies evaluator x₂…</quote>) and shows ‘fa’ tags x₁ and ‘kau’ is the indirect-question marker. Debater_B misassigns places and offers no quoted evidence for ‘kai’ vs. ‘kau’. Therefore A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_13:
We want “a likely cause” as a noun phrase: the causation predicate rinka modified by lakne in a tanru (‘lakne rinka fa …’). Option A makes rinka the main selbri with lakne as modifier, correctly yielding “likely cause for ‘many workers left’.” Option B instead makes the entire causing event the x1 of lakne, reading “it is likely that there is a causing event,” which shifts focus. Thus the translation in A matches the English. Hence the advocate of A wins.


CoT Answer for jbo_14:
Debater A’s claim that ro can’t attach to mi’a is unsubstantiated—none of their quotes say ro is restricted to da/de. Debater B shows with legitimate <quote>ro da zo'u da viska mi</quote> and <quote>ro da ro de zo'u da prami de</quote> that ro universally quantifies sumti. Since mi’a is a sumti, prepending ro to it is grammatical and captures “every one of us.” Therefore B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_15:
Both sides quote “be” attaches a sumti to x2 of ki’ogra. That means “re ki’ogra be lo grupu’o” correctly says “two kilograms of flour.” Debater_B’s claim that this misfires is illogical. Their su’o…poi structure doesn’t fill ki’ogra’s numeric place directly and is unidiomatic. Therefore Debater_A’s A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_17:
Both candidates hinge on scope markers. B uses tu’e without the required matching tu’u, so it’s ungrammatical. A employs ja’e bo, a short-scope result connector per the quoted grammar (“bo … has high precedence and short scope…”), correctly binding the first result clause and remaining grammatical. Thus A is the only valid translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_22:
Both debaters agree: poi = restrictive, noi = incidental. Only restrictive clause correctly identifies “the one thing” (‘namely that I love you’) as the sole item. Debater_B’s quotes show poi attaches identifying information, matching English “namely.” Debater_A’s incidental interpretation misreads ‘namely’ as side-note. Therefore B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_25:
Debater_B offers no verifiable quotes, so I can’t trust their grammatical claims. Debater_A cites a genuine example (<quote>…ki’u le nu…</quote>) showing ki’u must take an event abstraction, and a rule (<quote>if __bo__ is placed after an ijek…</quote>) showing bo here misgroups the modal. Therefore A is the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_26:
Both sides quoted valid definitions: bu'u = “coincident with/at the same place as,” ne'i = “within/inside of/into.” English “in Mecca” implies being inside the city’s bounds, matching ne'i. Debater_A’s claim that bu'u is correct for a city is unsupported by any quote. Therefore choice B is the accurate translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_27:
None


CoT Answer for jbo_31:
The only explicit quote says “po’o … always comes afterward.” In (A) po’o follows xunre, restricting “the red ones” as intended. In (B) po’o precedes titla, violating the rule. Therefore A correctly means “Only the red ones are sweet.”


CoT Answer for jbo_36:
Both debaters agree the question body is “slabu do fa xo valsi …” and the only issue is how to attach “lo meljo.” In Lojban, the cmavo be links its sumti to the next open place of the selbri. After filling x1 (“do”) and x2 (“xo valsi”), the next open is x3, so “be lo meljo” correctly means ‘in Malay.’ Using fi is only needed if you want to skip to a non‐next place. Hence choice B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_38:
Debater_A offers only a generic quote “fa tags x1 place” without context. Debater_B cites two concrete examples (<quote>Example 14.65…mi ge klama…gi nelci</quote> and <quote>Example 9.14…FA…then x2–x5</quote>) showing that in a forethought bridi the place structure resets after gi and only one FA is needed. Those valid quotes directly support choice B, so B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_40:
Both sides supplied valid quotes, but B’s use of vikmi (“excrete waste”) and ne'i/re'o (“inside”/“touching”) directly matches ‘pee in X, not on Y.’ A’s choice of farlu (“fall/drop”) is semantically off for peeing. Thus B more accurately and idiomatically expresses the intended meaning.


CoT Answer for jbo_51:
Debater_A cites a genuine grammar example (Example 9.18) showing se-cmavo creates a middle‐voice (“gone to by me”), directly paralleling “is easy to fold.” Their <quote>x1 (action) is easy for x2 (agent)</quote> supports se frili as the idiomatic construction. Debater_B’s FA‐tagging quotes are valid but describe a verbose tag mechanism, not the standard middle‐voice idiom. Therefore A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_54:
Debater_B cites the official brivla definition (<quote>cfari: x₁ [state/event/process] commences…</quote>) directly matching “start.” Debater_A offered no quotes or evidence. There’s no indication a causative compound is needed. Thus “ma cfari lo fagri” is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_55:
Debater_A supplied two <quote>…</quote> citations: one showing ’zmanei’ is a defined lujvo ‘to prefer’ with clear places, and one showing ’nelmau’ lacks any definition. Debater_B offered no evidence. Only Debater_A’s argument is supported by reliable quotes, so A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_56:
I only accept explicitly quoted material. Debater B cites <quote>mi catlu su'o re prenu</quote> to show su'o 100 tadni means “at least 100 students,” and quotes jmaji’s place‐structure. This directly parallels B’s “su'o 100 tadni cu jmaji lo crane be lo dinju.” Debater A’s abstractions, while elaborate, are unsupported by an example in quotes. Thus the straightforward, quoted pattern B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_58:
Debater_B provides multiple legitimate <quote>…</quote> citations: “jadni: x₁ adorns x₂,” “pi’o: ‘used by’,” and crucially that <quote>‘seljadnygau’, ‘No definition has been found’</quote>. The lack of a standard definition for seljadnygau means A’s lujvo is non-standard. By contrast, B’s rendering uses the well-defined gismu jadni with se-conversion and pi’o for “with,” faithfully capturing “We decorate the room with ribbons and banners.” Therefore B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_59:
Debater_A’s quoted definitions (“zi’o … represents a value which does not even exist” and “deletes it from selbri place structure”) directly support that fo zi’o means ‘no lid.’ Debater_B’s claim that zi’o only makes the place irrelevant contradicts those quotes and lacks counter‐quotes. Therefore choice A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_60:
Debater_B cites official <quote>ku</quote> entry showing it’s elidable and unnecessary before <quote>gi’e</quote>, plus a quote on bridi-tail termination by <quote>vau</quote>. Debater_A gave no such grammar evidence. Thus (B) without the extra <quote>ku</quote> is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_62:
Quotes show ze’o is a “location tense relation/direction; beyond/outward…,” so ze’o lo garbi’u validly serves as zvati’s place (x₂). Ragve is a 3-place gismu needing two sumti (gap and reference) but A supplies only one via be, leaving an argument undefined. Thus B correctly expresses “across the fence.”


CoT Answer for jbo_65:
The causal clause in Lojban must present the reason sentence first (we didn’t take them in), then its temporal argument (‘before it started to rain’). Option A, with ki’u tu’e mi’a ru na nergau .i pu bo co’a carvi, does exactly that: 1) ‘mi’a ru na nergau’ is the reason bridi ‘we didn’t take them in’, 2) ‘pu bo co’a carvi’ is its overt argument ‘before it started to rain’. Option B flips these, making the rain event the reason, so it misexpresses the causal order. Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_69:
English ‘You don’t seem to be very healthy’ negates the ‘very healthy’ property, not the ‘seem’ relation to ‘unhealthy.’ A, do na simlu lo ka kanro mutce, literally ‘It’s not that you seem very healthy,’ matches the nuance. B instead asserts ‘you seem unhealthy,’ omitting ‘very healthy.’


CoT Answer for jbo_70:
re’u is the ordinal ’second time’, so za’u re’u would mean ‘beyond the second time’ (3rd+), not a single extra occurrence. za’u roi correctly marks ‘more than once’ (i.e. again). Therefore option B is the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_74:
‘The Board’ in English is a descriptive title, not a proper name ‘Tanbo.’ In Lojban, lo+selbri denotes the actual group fitting that description, whereas la would force ‘tanbo’ into a proper name. Thus ‘lo tanbo cu zu’ejdi lo ka fitytoltu’i lo se stidi’ correctly says ‘the board decided to reject the proposal.’


CoT Answer for jbo_77:
None


CoT Answer for jbo_78:
Both sides agree that no=‘zero of’ and su’o=‘at least one’. The intended meaning “I didn’t give anything to anyone” requires negating the object and negating the recipient universally. Using su’o on the recipient would assert an existing recipient, which contradicts the English. Thus mi no da no de pu dunda correctly forces zero objects and zero recipients, matching the global negation. Therefore A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_85:
The two sides cite incompatible quotes I can’t verify. By standard Lojban grammar, a poi‐clause inside an indefinite sumti is closed with the sumti terminator ku. No nested clause here requires ku'o. Thus in (A) the red‐spot restriction ends correctly at ku and lo lolnitku'a attaches as the source. (B)’s ku'o would force the basement into the relative clause, misparsing the sentence.


CoT Answer for jbo_94:
Debater_B cites the <quote>cu</quote> entry as an “elidable marker” and an example <quote>mi [cu] klama…</quote> showing it may be omitted when the selbri is clear. Debater_A’s claim that “cu” is required isn’t backed by any quoted rule. Since standard Lojban permits dropping “cu” here, B is the better translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_95:
Since “se” (a conversion cmavo) cannot appear in a sumti, it unambiguously marks the start of the selbri. The definition <quote>cu … elidable marker: separates selbri from preceding sumti</quote> means “cu” is optional when the selbri is already signaled. Thus ‘lo cukta se pagbu 361 papri’ is both grammatical and clear, making Debater_B’s choice correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_96:
All cited quotes are legitimate. Both sentences parse, but cu is explicitly stated as elidable when no ambiguity exists (<quote>cu: elidable marker…</quote>). Debater_B shows that ‘lo tuple be do kanro di’a’ is unambiguous and more idiomatic, so B is the correct standard Lojban translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_100:
The correct selbri is zmadu with x₃=property. In B (do zmadu sutra lo drata), sutra fills zmadu’s x₃, yielding “you exceed the others in quickness.” A makes sutra a modifier of ‘exceed,’ giving a manner adverb (“exceed quickly”) without filling the property place. Therefore (B) matches “you’re faster than the others.”


CoT Answer for jbo_102:
Litce is a measuring selbri: x1=object, x2=number‐of‐liters, x3=standard. The standard idiom is to supply x2 with a PA‐sumti (PA LITCE) and attach the object with BE. A’s use of SU’O and a restrictive clause is at best awkward/ambiguous and may even be ungrammatical without a terminator. B cleanly says “one‐liter‐of‐water” as PA LITCE BE LO'E DJACU, so B is the better translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_105:
Both debaters quote the same examples for <quote>su’o</quote> binding and <quote>di’a</quote> placement. The natural, default Lojban order places sumti before the selbri: xu do su’o ratcu di’a kurji. Here su’o ratcu is the second sumti, di’a directly precedes the selbri kurji, yielding “Do you again have at least one rat?” This matches the English. B misplaces the object sumti after the selbri in a nondefault way.


CoT Answer for jbo_106:
Debater_A insists on .i and bo to isolate the modal, citing Ex.9.43, but their second clause lacks lo nu around the event abstraction and turns into a standalone bridi rather than a subordinate justification. Debater_B shows ki’u normally takes lo nu … to form a reason‐clause and their construction embeds it correctly (ki’u lo nu ri nu’o gau mi sepsi’u) without mis-scoping nu’o. B therefore yields a grammatical, semantically faithful translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_107:
Both debaters cite the same <quote>se: switch 1st/2nd places</quote> and agree frilyrai’s x1 is ‘thing’ and x2 ‘experiencer.’ To say “thing easy for me” we need x1=thing, x2=me, so NO se‐conversion. Thus lo frilyrai be fi mi is correct inside the ka‐clause, making A the right choice.


CoT Answer for jbo_111:
Neither side provided valid quotes, so I ignore their unverified claims. In standard Lojban, lo ckuliki cu troci nerkla is parsed as a tanru ‘troci nerkla’ (try-enter) with nerkla as the head (enter) modified by troci (try), correctly expressing “tried to enter.” Reversing the order would read ‘enter-try,’ which is not intended. Therefore choice A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_114:
The quotes show ki is the sticky‐tense suffix, not required for a one‐off temporal adverbial. “zi” alone marks a short temporal distance (“around noon”) before the event. Option A’s ki wrongly invokes stickiness; Option B correctly places zi without ki. Therefore B is the proper translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_121:
Only Debater B provided a verifiable <quote> for selma’o VAU, showing it ‘in compound bridi, separates common trailing sumti.’ That matches option A’s use of vau to close the first bridi‐tail before gi’e. No debater gave a real quote undermining A, so A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_122:
Debater_B supplies two explicit quotes: “Discursives…apply to the word immediately to the left” and the definition of ji’a as “additionally.” In (B) ji’a immediately follows se cnino, so it modifies “beginners,” yielding “beginners too are welcome.” Debater_A offers no quotes, so I credit Debater_B’s reasoning.


CoT Answer for jbo_124:
Debater_A offered no direct quotes or concrete evidence. Debater_B cited multiple <quote>…</quote> passages showing mi’o means the set {me,you} and ro must quantify elements within that set (not the pro-sumti itself). Those quotes convincingly support parsing lo mi’o ro kurjysi’u as “we each care for each other.” No contradictory evidence was given. Therefore, Debater_B’s translation is correct.
