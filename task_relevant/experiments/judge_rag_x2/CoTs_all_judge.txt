CoT Answer for jbo_1:
The debater cites two <verified_quote> definitions: ‘pensi’ covers thinking about a topic/concept but doesn’t license a du'u clause, whereas ‘jinvi’ specifically takes a du'u clause to express an opinion that a proposition is true. English “I think that we need to hurry up” is exactly an opined proposition, so mi jinvi lo du'u mi'a nitcu lo ka sutryze'a (B) is the correct choice.


CoT Answer for jbo_2:
The arguer provides two verified quotes: xu marks a true–false question and pinxe means “x₁ drinks beverage x₂.” In Lojban tanru the modifier precedes the head, so “apple tea” must be plise tcati, not tcati plise. Thus the correct form is do pinxe lo plise tcati ku xu, i.e. candidate A.


CoT Answer for jbo_3:
1. The debater quotes finti’s place structure from the official text (x1 inventor, x2 creation, x3 purpose, x4 source). 2. Adding se swaps x1 and x2, so x1 becomes the created object (the picture). 3. lo ka jai spaji lo vitke is a purpose clause, which must fill the 3rd place (x3). 4. By default untagged sumti fill x2, so we need the tag fi for the 3rd place. 5. Thus “lo pixra cu se finti fi lo ka jai spaji lo vitke” correctly assigns the purpose to x3.  Choice B follows from the quoted definitions and is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_4:
Verified quotes show punji means “put,” poi begins a restrictive clause and ku’o ends it. Option A correctly uses poi…ku’o before lo dakli pe do, isolating the clause ‘books on the table.’ Option B replaces ku’o with ku, failing to terminate the relative clause. Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_7:
The debater’s quotes (for .ei, grasu, gacri, cu) are all marked verified and correctly show that without cu, lo grasu gacri lo palne is parsed as a tanru (‘greasy-cover’) rather than a bridi. Thus .ei lo grasu cu gacri lo palne (option B) is indeed the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_8:
The debater cites a verified quote defining nupre’s places (x₁=agent, x₂=event, x₃=beneficiary). Choice B, without tags, fills x₂=do (impossible since x₂ must be an event). The debater also provides a verified quote on the fa/fe/fi tagging system, showing fe tags the 2nd place and fi tags the 3rd. In choice A, fe lo ka citka no lo rectu→x₂=the zero‐eat event, fi do→x₃=you, which matches the structure. Thus the arguments validly support A as correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_10:
The verified quote defines cumki as a modal gismu whose x₁ is the event and x₂ the condition. In “jai cumki carvi fa lo bavlamdei,” cumki is the selbri (x₁=carvi ‘raining’, x₂=lo bavlamdei ‘tomorrow’), correctly encoding ‘might rain tomorrow.’ The alternative makes carvi the selbri and treats cumki as a modifier, losing the modal scope. Thus the argument correctly shows B is the right translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_12:
The debater quotes the official definitions of djedi (a full day) and co’a (the start of an event), showing that ‘lo nu lo tamca co’a xunre’ means ‘the event of the tomato beginning to be red,’ which correctly captures ‘taking a day to turn red.’ They also quote carna, which denotes physical turning, not color change, undermining option B. Hence the evidence supports A.


CoT Answer for jbo_14:
All cited quotes are verified: mi’a is ‘we (not you)’, kansi’u is ‘do X together’, and ro is a universal quantifier for variables, not for personal pro-sumti. Adding ro to mi’a is ungrammatical and redundant. Thus “mi’a kansi’u lo ka sanga” correctly means ‘we sang together.’


CoT Answer for jbo_15:
The quotes given are mere definitions of li, be, poi, etc., not evidence that ‘re ki’ogra be lo grupu’o’ correctly expresses ‘two kilograms of flour.’ No quotation shows that x2 in nitcu must be a physical quantity in that structure. The argument fails to demonstrate why A is better than B, so the conclusion is unsupported.


CoT Answer for jbo_18:
All verified quotes show that “.e.nai” is the correct ‘and-not’ connective (points 1–3) and that “pu’i klama” expresses ‘have been’ (point 4). Option B’s “na .e” wrongly negates the bridi instead of linking the two places, so A is the better translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_21:
The debater’s key grammar rule (“use be…bei…be'o for multiple linked sumti; ku only ends a lo‐phrase”) is plausible but unsupported by any <verified_quote> evidence. Their only citation is marked <invalid_quote>, so per instructions we cannot trust it. Without any verified quotes, the argument lacks authoritative support, so we must reject it.


CoT Answer for jbo_22:
They provided a verified quote showing poi is the restrictive relative clause marker, exactly what’s needed to identify the one proposition. That matches the requirement to single out ‘the one thing I’m convinced of.’ Thus mi birti pa da poi du'u mi do prami is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_23:
The verified quotes define ka as a property abstractor and kei as its required terminator. Candidate A uses vau instead, misclosing the ka abstraction. Candidate B correctly inserts kei, so the argument is sound and B is the better translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_24:
They quote punji’s definition (gismu ‘put’) and the cmavo definitions: ge…gi conjoins bridi (predicates), whereas .e conjoins sumti. Sentence B uses .e, so it wrongly conjoins the bottles as arguments of a single punji, not two separate ‘put’ events. Sentence A’s use of ge…gi correctly yields two bridi: ‘put empty bottle in bin’ AND ‘put full bottle on table.’ Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_25:
The key ‘quote’ in point 1 is marked <invalid_quote>, so there’s no verified evidence that Lojban uses X BAI le nu Y equivalently. All further claims build on that unsubstantiated premise. Without any valid quotes or external proof, the argument fails to justify why A is superior. Therefore the conclusion (A) isn’t supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_26:
The debater cites verified quotes: bu'u means “coincident with/at the same place,” while ne'i means “within/inside.” “In Mecca” here denotes location at Mecca, not inside an area, so bu'u is the proper cmavo. Thus A is supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_27:
They gave verified quotes for ri and ru. ri = last sumti (lo’e remna), so mi ri limna wrongly refers to swimming among people. ru = remote past sumti, skipping lo’e remna back to lo lalxu, so mi ru limna correctly means swimming in the lake. Thus B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_29:
They provided legit quotes showing ka is a property/quality abstractor and that kei terminates abstractions. From these, it follows that the ka-abstraction must end with kei, not ku. Thus choice B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_30:
The key is choosing the correct 1st‐person plural cmavo. Verified quote for mi’a shows it means “we, not you” (so excludes the listener). To express “let’s” (speaker + listener), mi’o is required. The .e’u tag correctly marks a suggestion, and mi’o yields ‘let us watch the sunset.’ Thus the argument cleanly supports A.


CoT Answer for jbo_31:
The only verified quote simply defines po‘o as “only” but says nothing about its placement. All claims about po‘o’s position and how it attaches to sumti vs. selbri are unsupported (the placement rule is wrapped in <invalid_quote>, so we can’t trust it). No evidence compares the two options or shows why A is better. Therefore the argument doesn’t support choice A.


CoT Answer for jbo_32:
The gismu xanri has places x1=concept, x2=imaginee (<verified_quote lines=5875-5877>), so lo xanri be ri = ‘the concepts in their imaginations.’ Using se-xanri would swap roles (concept↔imaginee), giving the wrong meaning. Thus choice A is supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_33:
They correctly quote ‘panzi’ and the ‘se’ conversion, but their key claim about dropping the prenex (zo’u) is in an <invalid_quote> and thus unsupported. They provide no verified evidence that A’s structure is strictly preferred over B’s, so their conclusion isn’t convincingly justified.


CoT Answer for jbo_34:
Both verified quotes match: ‘zutse’ places sitter on surface x₂ and ‘korbi’ places bank (edge) x₁ next to x₃. In lo korbi be lo rirxe, rirxe fills korbi’s x₃ yielding the riverbank as surface. Reversing them makes ‘river’ the head, not the bank. Thus translation A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_35:
The debater quotes definitions for steci, lumci, kancu and the ka…kei abstractor, but never provides a verified quote showing that ce’u (not goi) is the correct abstraction focus here or that goi is disallowed. Their key claim about ce’u is unsupported by quote, and the pi’u/ce’o quote cited doesn’t justify the use of ce’u. Without evidence that B’s use of goi is invalid or A’s use of ce’u is valid, the conclusion is unsubstantiated.


CoT Answer for jbo_36:
All cited quotes are verified. ‘be’ links a sumti into the default (x2) place of a selbri, while ‘fi’ tags the 3rd place (x3). Since valsi’s 3rd place is the language, only ‘valsi be fi lo meljo’ correctly yields ‘words in Malay.’ Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_37:
The debater cites a verified definition of pe as a restrictive/associative marker and shows that “X pe Y” yields “X associated with Y.” To say “the teacher’s dog,” we need “the dog associated with the teacher,” i.e. lo gerku pe lo ctuca cu morsi. Verified quotes for pe, gerku, and morsi back this up. Thus B follows logically.


CoT Answer for jbo_40:
The pro-A side provides four verified quotes for pinca, farlu, nenri, and vimstizu that exactly map to “pee falls into the toilet,” plus nai correctly negates “floor.” Their reading matches the English sentence. The anti-B points are unsubstantiated and offer no verified evidence that B is better. Therefore A is better supported by the verified quotes.


CoT Answer for jbo_41:
The only verified quote defines .a’o’s meaning, not its position. The example of .a’o placement is in an <invalid_quote> and thus unusable. No authoritative evidence was provided that .a’o must precede the selbri, so the argument does not support choice A as better.


CoT Answer for jbo_44:
The debater provided verified quotes showing klaku means ‘weep/cry tears’ and krixa means ‘cry out/yell.’ The English sentence implies weeping tears, not yelling. Therefore the version using klaku (option A) is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_45:
The debater shows via multiple <verified_quote> tags that ‘tavla’ means ‘talk to’ (x1 talks to x2) whereas ‘casnu’ is the correct gismu for ‘discuss’ (x2 is the topic). They cite Lesson 5 on SE‐reordering and illustrate that applying SE to casnu swaps x1/x2 so that the sumti is ‘what we discussed.’ The candidate A form with ‘se tavla’ would yield ‘the one we talked to,’ not ‘what we talked about.’ Hence the evidence supports B.


CoT Answer for jbo_46:
They correctly identify that ‘loi’ is the veridical mass descriptor (“the mass of seven cats”) versus ‘lo’ (“the ones that really are”); they support both with verified quotes. Their translation ‘ci loi ze mlatu cu xekri’ matches 'three of the seven cats are black,' whereas ‘ci lo ze mlatu’ would be 'three things that are seven cats,' which is nonsensical. Thus the argument validly supports choice B as the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_47:
The quotes confirm ke'o is a vocative ‘please repeat,’ not the discursive ‘I repeat.’ ke'u is the correct discursive marker. All other gismu use checks out (zmadu, fanmo, krasi, ka, mi’o). Hence translation B is supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_48:
The definitions of mi and cnino and the fact that coi is a vocative cmavo are verified. However, the key claim that coi must precede the bridi is supported only by an <invalid_quote> and thus unverified. Without evidence from the text on ordering, the argument fails to prove that coi mi cnino is obligatorily better than mi cnino coi.


CoT Answer for jbo_49:
They cite verified definitions of re (‘2’) and mi (‘me’), but provide no quoted evidence that numeric quantifiers must precede possessors in sumti. The key word‐order rule is asserted, not supported by any <verified_quote>, so their conclusion isn’t conclusively proven.


CoT Answer for jbo_50:
All verified quotes align: ‘bapli’ forces an event (x₂ must be an event), so we need lo nu do citka (‘the event of you eating’), not lo ka citka (‘the property of eating’). Word‐order ra bapli lo nu do citka correctly means ‘Did they force you to eat?’ whereas ra do bapli lo ka citka misassigns arguments. Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_51:
The debater provides legitimate <verified_quote> quotes for frili, FA, and SE, and correctly shows that using SE turns the chair into the agent of folding (nonsensical). They also correctly place the folding‐this‐chair abstraction into frili’s x1 with FA. Their logic is sound, so B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_52:
They cite two verified definitions: zmiku ‘automatic in function x₂ under conditions x₃’ and cenba ‘varies in property x₂ under conditions x₄.’ In A, zmiku modifies the event of cenba (the windows’ varying), matching ‘vary…automatically.’ In B, the relative clause poi zmiku instead attaches ‘automatic’ to the transparency property (guskli), yielding ‘the windows vary in automatically transparency,’ which misplaces the automation. Thus A best captures the intended meaning.


CoT Answer for jbo_53:
The verified quote shows pluka’s x1 is the event/state being found pleasant and x2 is the experiencer. In A, la .xelen. precedes cu so fills x1 (wrong role) and lo ka bajra is x2 by default. In B, pluka la .xelen. fa lo ka bajra pa’o lo rictu’a explicitly assigns la .xelen. to x2 (experiencer) and lo ka… to x1 (the run‐through‐the‐woods event). Hence B correctly models “Helen enjoys running through the woods.”


CoT Answer for jbo_54:
The gismu cfari is intransitive/non-agentive (<verified_quote lines=5919-5921>), so ma cfari lo fagri asks “which process began the fire?” The lujvo cfagau (cfari+gasnu) is explicitly ‘to initiate something’ with an agentive argument (<verified_quote lines=6099-6101>), matching “who started the fire?” Thus A (ma cfagau lo fagri) is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_57:
The debater’s sole valid quotes merely define ‘lo’ and ‘du’u,’ not the critical ‘kaidji’ or the syntax difference between the two candidate sentences. The key quotation about ‘kaidji’ is marked invalid, so no evidence shows why translation A handles the subordinate clause or evidentiality correctly. Without trustworthy evidence, their assertion that A is better is unsupported.


CoT Answer for jbo_58:
Their main evidence against A—claiming seljadnygau is non-standard—is unsupported: the quoted lujvo (‘sutryze’a’) is unrelated. They do correctly quote ‘jadni’, ‘pi’o’, and ‘jo’u’ for B, but they never invalidate A. Hence the conclusion B isn’t sufficiently supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_61:
The only direct quote is about GIhA (unrelated), and the one defining je vs ja is marked <invalid_quote>, so there is no verified evidence that je means ‘and’ and ja ‘or.’ Without a valid quote or other proof, the argument fails to support choice A.


CoT Answer for jbo_62:
All quotes are verified: ragve is a 3-place gismu needing x3 (the reference object) and x2 is the boundary. In lo tricu cu zvati lo ragve be lo garbi'u only x2 is filled, so x3 is missing and the sentence is incomplete. Ze'o is a locative‐directional cmavo meaning “beyond/outward from,” and correctly expresses “across the fence.” Hence the argument that B is the better translation is valid.


CoT Answer for jbo_63:
The debater backs their choice with a verified quote showing ga’a marks a bridi as witnessed by its x1 (here ‘do’). That directly matches “as you saw.” The invalid quote about za’a can be ignored, but it isn’t needed. The key evidence for ga’a is sound, so the argument correctly supports choice B.


CoT Answer for jbo_64:
The debater shows that ro=‘each’, da=‘sumti variable’, pe=‘restrictive phrase marker’, bu’u=‘at (location)’, bilma=‘sick’—all from verified quotes. ro da pe bu’u ti bilma thus literally says ‘each x which is at here is sick.’ Omitting pe in B yields no restriction to ‘here,’ so it fails to capture ‘everybody here.’ Hence A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_65:
The debater provided definitions for individual cmavo via verified quotes, but never presented any evidence or quoted text to show why word‐order A is preferable over B. Key claims about ki’u and clause bracketing rely on invalid quotes or unverified assertions. Lacking direct support that A conveys the intended causal sequence more accurately, I cannot accept the conclusion.


CoT Answer for jbo_66:
The valid <verified_quote> entries show that pe is the restrictive relative marker (‘which I drank’) while be merely links a sumti (‘with me as drinker’) without restriction. Thus option B (using pe) correctly captures ‘the one I drank’, so the conclusion is supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_68:
They cite the gismu ckini’s definition but offer no verified evidence for the place structure of the abstractor bei. Without proof of how bei orders its sumti, their re-assignment of roles is unsubstantiated. Thus their argument fails to support B.


CoT Answer for jbo_70:
The debater’s key quotes on PA cmavo are marked <invalid_quote> and thus unverified. The sole <verified_quote> on SI’e is irrelevant to the PA discussion. No reliable evidence shows why ‘roi’ is correct over ‘re’u’. Therefore the arguments fail to support their conclusion.


CoT Answer for jbo_71:
The debater cites two <verified_quote> definitions: spali is an action ‘polish’, while jadni is an adornment ‘decoration/substance.’ ‘Nail polish’ names a substance/adornment, not an action. Thus lo jgalu jadni correctly captures the meaning, supporting choice B.


CoT Answer for jbo_73:
1. <verified_quote lines=5945-5947> defines famti as aunt/uncle, not nephew. 2. <verified_quote lines=6491-6493> confirms se is the 2nd-conversion cmavo swapping x1/x2. 3. Therefore se famti = nephew. 4. Option A uses lo se famti be do for ‘your nephew’, while B would mean ‘your aunt/uncle’. 5. Hence A is the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_75:
The only verified quote defines ‘be’ linking sumti but says nothing about how ‘se’ swaps places. The key claim about SE’s effect on zgipli’s place structure relies on an <invalid_quote> and unsupported inference. No valid evidence shows B is better, so the argument fails to support the conclusion.


CoT Answer for jbo_76:
The debater shows via a verified quote that cmene’s first place is the quoted name string. They also provide a verified quote that la .robert. tags a person named Robert rather than quoting the word. Thus cmene lo jukpa fa la .robert. would supply an individual, not the name string. Using zo to quote “.robert.” correctly fills cmene’s x1 with the name token, so choice B follows logically.


CoT Answer for jbo_77:
The debater cites two <verified_quote> entries: tarbykansi'u is tarbi+kansa+simxu (including simxu ‘similar person’ → twins), whereas tarbykansa is only tarbi+kansa (no simxu). Thus only tarbykansi'u correctly encodes ‘twins,’ so choice A is supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_80:
The debater cites verified gismu definitions for skori (‘cord, cable’) and tunka (‘copper’) and applies standard tanru word order (modifier before head) to form ‘tunka skori’ = ‘copper cord/wire.’ This directly supports choice A. No unverified claims are used, so the reasoning is sound.


CoT Answer for jbo_82:
The key is that klama’s third place (x3) is the origin ‘from’, and that is explicitly tagged by fi. The debater cites a verified quote for klama’s places (x3=origin) and for fi marking the 3rd place. In A lo zunle vorme is tagged as x3 (origin), so it faithfully renders ‘from the left door’. In B, untagged sumti goes into x2 (destination), meaning ‘to the left door’, which is wrong. Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_83:
1. tavla’s 1st, 2nd, 3rd places are ‘speaker talks to listener about topic’.  
2. Without fi, lo’e gerku occupies the 2nd place by default → ‘talks to dogs’.  
3. fi is the 3rd‐place tag (<verified_quote lines=6503-6505>), so ‘tavla fi lo’e gerku’ places dogs in the topic slot → ‘talk about dogs’.  
4. Therefore B correctly renders “talking about dogs.”


CoT Answer for jbo_84:
The debater’s two verified quotes show farlu’s 3rd sumti is the ‘from’ argument, and cmavo fi tags that place. Without fi, lo jubme fills farlu’s 2nd place (‘to/onto’), not ‘from’. Hence only A correctly expresses ‘from the table’.


CoT Answer for jbo_85:
The debater provides two explicit verified quotes: one stating poi…ku’o marks restrictive relative clauses, and another that ku simply ends a selbri→sumti conversion. Since our clause is restrictive (using poi), it must terminate with ku’o, not ku. Thus translation B is the correct choice.


CoT Answer for jbo_86:
The debater cites three <verified_quote> passages: poi is a restrictive relative clause marker requiring termination by ku’o; ku’o ends such clauses; zo quotes exactly one word. Candidate A shows poi…ku’o before zo tordydu’e, matching the definitions. B omits ku’o and misplaces the quote marker. Therefore A is grammatically correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_88:
The debater provides two <verified_quote> excerpts showing that “.e” is the sumti‐level ‘and’ whereas “je” is a tanru‐internal connector. Since we’re conjoining two location sumti (“on the fence” and “then on the roof”), .e is the correct connector. Thus option A is supported by the quotes.


CoT Answer for jbo_89:
The debater cites two <verified_quote> entries: “je” is a tanru-internal connector and “.e” is a sumti-level connector. Since ‘marji’ takes two sumti (wood and plastic), they must be joined with .e, not je. Thus choice B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_90:
The debater provides two <verified_quote> entries: .e is defined as the sumti‐level ‘and’ (logical connective for sumti afterthoughts), whereas je is a tanru‐internal connective. The English sentence ‘I dislike both salt and pepper’ coordinates two sumti, not two tanru. Thus translation A (using .e) correctly captures the intended sumti‐level conjunction, so A is supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_91:
The debater’s key FA‐tag claim (fe = x2, fi = x3) is correct Lojban, but they cite only an <invalid_quote> so provide no verifiable support. Under the rule to trust only valid quotes, their argument fails.


CoT Answer for jbo_92:
The debater shows via verified quotes that su'o = ∃, ro = ∀, da = x, and stuvi’e = visits(x,y), so A yields ∃x∀y(country(y)→visits(x,y)) matching “Has anybody visited every country?” B instead yields ∀y∃x visits(x,y). Thus A correctly captures the intended meaning.


CoT Answer for jbo_93:
Only the definition of mipri is verified. Key claims about ro, su’o, and modal conversion (jai se ckeji) lack verification. Without trustworthy quotes for these steps, the argument isn’t sufficiently evidenced to conclude B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_94:
1. Verified quotes confirm ‘cu’ is the selbri‐separator (necessary for clarity) and ‘ze’u’ marks a long interval “through the night.” 2. Argument shows version B omits ‘cu’, making the sumti–selbri boundary unclear. 3. Both pieces of evidence are from the text. 4. Therefore the arguments correctly support A as the better translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_95:
The debater’s quotes for pagbu, se, and cu are all verified. pagbu x1 is part of x2, and se pagbu swaps places so that 361 pages (S2) is the part of the book (S1), matching “the book has 361 pages.” The cu is required to separate the sumti from the selbri since the selbri begins with cmavo se. Therefore option B is correctly formed and conveys the intended meaning.


CoT Answer for jbo_97:
The debater cites a verified definition of cpedu (x₁ requests x₂ from x₃) and the bridi-tagging rules. Without tags, ‘lo vecnu’ becomes x₂, but we need it as x₃. Using fi for x₃ and fe for x₂, as in B, correctly places ‘the seller’ and ‘a discount.’ Thus the evidence supports B.


CoT Answer for jbo_100:
Verified definitions show zmadu means ‘more’ and sutra means ‘fast’. In Lojban bridi X exceeds Y in property Z is expressed as X ZMadu Y with Z as the property. Here Z is sutra, so do sutra zmadu lo drata correctly says ‘You exceed the others in speed.’ The opposite ordering in option B misplaces the property and is wrong.


CoT Answer for jbo_101:
The debater’s two verified quotes show ‘zbasu’ means ‘build/manufacture’ while ‘gasnu’ is the gismu for ‘do/bring about an event.’ Co’u dasni ‘undress’ is an event that the police caused, so gasnu is the correct bridi. Therefore B is supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_104:
Both .e and ku’i were quoted from the grammar. .e is a sumti-connector, so it can’t join entire bridi; ku’i is the discursive bridi-connector ‘however/but.’ Also, placing nai before lo canko in B negates the window as a sumti, not the predicate ‘easy.’ Thus choice A’s ku’i correctly contrasts two full bridi and negates the second predication, matching the English.


CoT Answer for jbo_105:
They provided three verified quotes defining di’a (a resumptive event marker), kurji (take-care-of), and su’o (at least some). In Lojban, di’a is a ZAhO cmavo that modifies the selbri, so it must follow the predicate kurji, not the sumti ratcu. The sumti quantifier su’o likewise precedes ratcu. Thus xu do di’a kurji su’o ratcu correctly renders “do you have (i.e. take care of) some rats again?” and supports conclusion B.


CoT Answer for jbo_107:
The debater cites valid definitions of ka, se, and be (all with verified quotes) but never shows why version A is preferable to B or what’s wrong with B. Thus the argument doesn’t actually support the conclusion.


CoT Answer for jbo_109:
The quotes show “be” attaches a sumti as x₂ to a selbri. In A, that makes x₁=.ekcala (clown), x₂=nazbi (nose), so it reads “the clown is the nose.” In B, x₁=nazbi, x₂=.ekcala, so “the nose of the clown.” With xunre modifying x₁, B correctly means “The clown’s nose is red.”


CoT Answer for jbo_114:
They cite verified definitions for co’a, zi, fa but the key claim against ki rests on an <invalid_quote> and so is unsubstantiated. No evidence shows ki is misused here, so the reasoning fails and B is not demonstrated superior.


CoT Answer for jbo_115:
The debater’s key evidence for pe’u being a vocative comes from a quote showing “.u’a ...” not pe’u, so it doesn’t actually verify pe’u’s vocative use. They list definitions for ti and vajni correctly, but they offer no verified quote establishing the rule that vocatives must precede their hosts. Thus their conclusion lacks supported evidence and fails to justify A.


CoT Answer for jbo_117:
The debater shows that 'djica' takes an event abstract (nu), not a property abstract (ka). They back this with verified quotes for 'djica', 'nu', and 'ka', and correctly observe that we’re wanting the door’s state (an event) to be at the east side. They also use the quoted definition of 'stuzi' and its selbri conversion to show B matches “the door is at the east side.” Hence the reasoning is sound and supports choosing B.


CoT Answer for jbo_119:
Verified quotes show birti’s second place must be a bridi abstraction, not a sumti. The du’u–kau construction yields an indirect-question bridi (‘how heavy the couch is’), satisfying birti’s place structure. Option A feeds birti a sumti (‘the couch’s weight’), violating its definition. Therefore B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_120:
The debater shows that no prenu cu prane literally means “zero people are perfect,” matching “nobody is perfect.” They also demonstrate no prenu na prane would mean “zero people are not perfect” or “all people are perfect,” the opposite. Their verified quotes for no, prenu, prane, and na support this. Thus the correct translation is option A.


CoT Answer for jbo_121:
The debater provides no <verified_quote> evidence—only an <invalid_quote>—to support using vau. In fact, the property clause lo ka co’a cilmo is correctly closed with ku, and then selbri‐level gi’e ku’i connects to masno lo ka co’a sudga. No explicit vau is needed, so B is the better translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_122:
The two verified quotes show ‘ku’ ends the sumti-descriptor and ‘ji’a’ is a discursive modifier meaning ‘in addition.’ In A ‘ji’a’ comes after the sumti (lo’e se cnino ku) and thus modifies the bridi ‘zanvi’e’ (‘are welcome’) giving ‘Beginners are welcome too.’ In B, ‘ji’a’ falls inside the sumti, wrongly marking ‘beginners too’ instead of the predicate. Hence A is the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_123:
All key quotes (lo'e ‘typical’, ra’u ‘chiefly’, ta’e ‘habitually’) are verified. The debater correctly shows ra’u must be inside the sumti to modify ‘hope’ before ku; if placed after ku it modifies ‘fail’ instead. Thus ‘lo’e pacna ra’u ku fliba ta’e’ accurately means ‘those who mainly hope usually fail.’


CoT Answer for jbo_124:
Verified quotes show mi’o=‘us’, ro=‘each/all’, and the lujvo kurjysi’u=‘care for each other’. ‘ro mi’o’ thus means ‘each of us’, so lo ro mi’o kurjysi’u correctly says ‘we all care for each other.’ The alternative lo mi’o ro kurjysi’u misgroups ro with the predicate. Therefore A is correct.
