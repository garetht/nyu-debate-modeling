CoT Answer for jbo_5:
The debater’s core claim is that sumti must be joined with .e, not je. The verified_quote tags show je is ‘tanru-internal afterthought and’ and .e is ‘sumti afterthought and.’ Thus using lo mexno .e lo serbo .e lo xindo correctly enumerates separate visitors. The quotes directly support this, so the conclusion (B) is correctly defended.


CoT Answer for jbo_6:
All quoted definitions are valid: dunda’s places are donor, gift, recipient; su’o fukpi = at least one copy; ro lamgre = each passerby. B’s word order matches these roles. A misuses fi/fe and omits necessary sumti. Thus B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_9:
The debater cites verified definitions of jdima and be to show “lo jdima be lo nanba” correctly expresses the price of the bread. Since djuno’s second argument (x₂) can be a sumti, “xu do djuno lo jdima be lo nanba” directly asks “Do you know the price of the bread?” The B form’s use of “lo du’u ma kau jdima lo nanba” is an unnecessary and ungrammatical wh-clause. Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_11:
The contestant shows with verifiable quotes that mansa requires an event-state sumti (‘lo nu …’), and ‘ma kau ni glare’ correctly uses kau as the indirect-question marker for “how hot it is.” By contrast, kai is a modal (rafsi/ckaji) not intended to mark indirect questions. All their key claims are backed by <verified_quote> tags, so the evidence supports choice A.


CoT Answer for jbo_13:
The proffered argument is essentially gibberish and does not coherently show why translation B is superior. Aside from mis-citing multiple Lojban terms without linking them to the original English structure, it offers no clear derivation or correct use of bridi and cmavo to mirror “A likely cause is that many of the workers left.” No single quoted definition justifies choosing option B over A. Therefore the conclusion is unsupported.


CoT Answer for jbo_16:
The debater offers no <verified_quote> evidence—only <invalid_quote>—so we have no reliable support for their claim. Without any trustworthy citations, their reasoning fails to justify choosing A.


CoT Answer for jbo_17:
The debater provides verified quotes showing ja’e is a BAI modal ‘therefore’ and bo is a short-scope joiner, exactly what’s needed to link ‘stores closed’ and ‘we must be quiet.’ They also correctly cite tu’e as a multi-utterance scope opener, which is unnecessary here. Thus the evidence supports choice A.


CoT Answer for jbo_19:
The debater cites verified definitions: “.e” is the sumti-afterthought ‘and’, “.nai” negates the last word, so “.e.nai lo xislu” cleanly yields ‘and not the wheel.’ By contrast, B’s ge…gi structure is a fore-and pairing for ‘both…and,’ not for expressing simple negation. The quotes support that A is the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_20:
The quotes confirm morji’s gismu structure, su’o as a modifier of the sumti, and ba’o as a tense operator that must directly precede the selbri. In A, ba’o is split from morji by su’o vajni, misplacing the tense. In B, mi ba’o morji su’o vajni correctly attaches ba’o to morji, so the argument validly supports conclusion B.


CoT Answer for jbo_28:
The debater for A only cites the gismu ‘troci’ and cmavo ‘co’ definitions but never provides any authoritative rule or example showing that ‘ko troci co katna lo guzme’ is the standard way to render “Try to cut the melon.” Their claims about tanru inversion are unsubstantiated by quotes on word order or idiomatic usage. Without explicit evidence favoring A’s ordering, the argument fails to establish A’s conclusion.


CoT Answer for jbo_38:
The key rule about forethought connectives ge…gi is only supported by an <invalid_quote>, so we have no verified basis that each bridi must be tagged inside the ge…gi frame. Without evidence for that syntax, the argument’s main justification fails. Thus their conclusion (A is correct) isn’t properly supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_39:
The debater cites no <verified_quote> evidence—every quotation is marked <invalid_quote>. Without any trustworthy quotes, their claims lack support, so I must reject their conclusion.


CoT Answer for jbo_42:
Verified quotes show djica is the main selbri (x1 desires x2) and dansu names the dance event (x2). Choice B correctly makes djica the predicate and fills its second place with the dancing event, so B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_43:
The debater supplies three legitimate <verified_quote> citations defining ba (‘after’), zi (‘short time’), and nu (event abstraction), exactly matching the intended meaning of “Soon after reaching the coast…” in A’s ordering. Although they don’t explicitly dismantle B, their evidence establishes that A’s placement of ba zi nu produces the correct temporal relation, so the conclusion in favor of A is supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_55:
Debater A quotes a verified dictionary entry for zmanei (‘to prefer’, lujvo from zmadu+nelci) and shows no evidence for any lujvo “nelmau”. The second form relies on a nonexistent term. Thus A’s solution is supported by correct quotes and wins.


CoT Answer for jbo_56:
The debater cites only verified Lojban definitions (su’o, jmaji, crane, be, dinju) to show that ‘su’o 100 tadni cu jmaji lo crane be lo dinju’ directly and idiomatically renders “At least 100 students gathered in front of the building.” The alternative A over-abstracts with lo ka…kancusu’oi and isn’t supported by any quoted definitions. All core claims rest on valid quotes, so B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_59:
The argument cites a verified definition of botpi showing lid as 4th place, and verified quotes for fo (tagging 4th place) and zi’o (marking a place as nonexistent). Thus ti botpi fo zi’o correctly encodes “bottle with no lid,” and the extra .e no da is superfluous.


CoT Answer for jbo_60:
The only structural difference is the extra ‘ku’ after lo’e nu cladu in (A). The verified quote shows that ‘ku’ is an elidable terminator for a sumti description. Since it isn’t required, (B) omits it for a cleaner bridi. The ci’e ‘gi’e’ and ‘ku’i’ usages are identical in both. Thus the evidence supports selecting B.


CoT Answer for jbo_67:
The debater’s only verified quote discusses brivla morphology, not mathematical grouping or ve’i/ve’o usage. Their ve’i/ve’o citation is marked invalid. No reliable evidence supports that the second translation is correct, so their conclusion (B) is unsupported.


CoT Answer for jbo_69:
They supply two verified gismu definitions: simlu ‘seem’ and mutce ‘very’, matching A’s structure do na simlu lo ka kanro mutce. The invalid_quote about na placement doesn’t block the clear reading that na before simlu negates the entire bridi, yielding ‘You don’t seem very healthy.’ The alternative B shifts negation inside the property (‘other-than healthy’), changing the meaning. Thus the evidence supports A.


CoT Answer for jbo_72:
The debater’s key point is that ku terminates the lo-sumti, so any following je clause falls outside the description. The <verified_quote> shows ku is an “end sumti” marker. Thus putting ku before je would detach the ‘work in Bulgaria’ clause. Omitting ku keeps both predicates inside lo … , giving the intended ‘people who live in Greece and work in Bulgaria.’ Therefore translation B is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_74:
All key claims cite verified quotes. ‘la’ vs ‘lo’ is supported by definitions. ‘zu’ejdi’ for ‘decide to’, ‘fitytoltu’i’ + ‘se stidi’ for ‘reject proposal’, and ‘ka’ for abstraction each match their verified entries. The logic is sound, so choice B is correctly justified.


CoT Answer for jbo_78:
The argument shows “no” is the zero‐quantifier and “su’o” is at least one. To say I didn’t give anything to anyone requires zero gifts and zero recipients: no da no de. Using su’o de would force at least one recipient, contradicting “anyone.” Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_79:
The debater cites three <verified_quote> definitions—ralte = “have,” kabri = “cup/glass containing X₂,” vanju = “contains wine”—to show that the correct tanru head must be kabri, giving kabri vanju (“wine glass”). Reversing them (vanju kabri) yields “wine made of cups,” which is nonsense. All quotes are verified and support choosing A.


CoT Answer for jbo_81:
The debater cites legitimate <verified_quote> tags for pu’i and jibgu’a. pu’i = “can and has” and jibgu’a = “employee (jibri+gunka)” with arguments (store, person). In xu do pu’i jibgu’a zarci, x1=zarci, x2=do gives “you can/ have been an employee of a store,” matching “Have you worked at a store?” The B ordering (xu do pu’i zarci jibgu’a) misassigns roles (makes you a store). Hence A is supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_87:
Only one verified quote appears, giving general definitions of poi and ku’o, noting ku’o is elidable but preferred in complex clauses. No direct evidence shows the first form is ungrammatical or the second strictly better. The debater’s claims lack supporting quotes from authoritative grammar. Therefore, their conclusion favoring B is unsupported.


CoT Answer for jbo_96:
The debater’s quotes do not demonstrate why ‘cu’ must be omitted. The cited <verified_quote> merely defines ‘cu’ as an elidable separator, not that it should be dropped here. No evidence shows that ‘kanro di’a’ must follow directly without ‘cu’. Thus their reasoning fails to support choosing B.


CoT Answer for jbo_98:
The debater’s key evidence are marked as <invalid_quote>, so we cannot verify any claim about using kau. Without any verified source or correct reference to Lojban grammar, their argument is unsupported. Therefore their conclusion (A is correct) is not reliably justified.


CoT Answer for jbo_99:
The debater cites verified quotes for UI6 (yes/no question), kakne, pensi, manti and lo’e. They correctly show that in xu kakne pensi fa lo’e manti the selbri is kakne (to be able) with x1=lo’e manti (ants) and x2=pensi (thinking). In contrast, xu pensi kakne fa lo’e manti wrongly makes pensi the selbri, yielding “ants think able,” which doesn’t match “Can ants think?” Thus A is correct.


CoT Answer for jbo_102:
All cited quotes are verified. The debaters show that A’s formula (su’o djacu poi litce li pa) quantifies ‘at least one water-item of exactly one liter’—not the volume drank—whereas B’s (pa litce be lo’e djacu) directly specifies ‘one liter of water’ as x₂ of pinxe. Thus the evidence supports B as the correct translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_103:
The debater’s key claim about VAU’s function is in an <invalid_quote>, so it isn’t supported by any verified text. The only <verified_quote> shows word order examples unrelated to VAU. Without a legitimate quote on VAU’s role, their reasoning fails to prove B is superior. Therefore, the conclusion is unsupported.


CoT Answer for jbo_106:
The debater’s core evidence rests on two quoted grammar rules, but both are wrapped in <invalid_quote> tags, so they’re not legitimately from the source. Without any verified citations, there’s no basis to claim that .i ki’u bo must appear as in choice A, nor that omitting bo in B misattaches the modal. The argument fails to provide real evidence, so it does not support selecting A.


CoT Answer for jbo_108:
All cited quotes are verified. ‘zilfadni’ takes a KA clause; ‘ka…kei’ forms a property abstraction. ‘damba’ (x1 fights x2 over issue x3) and ‘rirni’ (parent) combine so that in lo ka ce’u damba lo rirni be ce’u the open variable ce’u correctly fills both fighter and parent roles. Using ri instead of ce’u would refer to a preceding sumti that doesn’t exist. Thus the argument correctly shows option B is the proper translation.


CoT Answer for jbo_110:
The debater gives raw dictionary entries for cmavo “co’a” and “ku” but never shows how those establish that ‘do gleki co’a lo nu ra mo’u jukpa’ correctly captures ‘as soon as they finished cooking.’ No quotation or firm grammatical rule ties the pieces together to justify A. Thus the argument fails to support the conclusion.


CoT Answer for jbo_111:
Verified quotes show ze’a marks a medium time interval and troci is a brivla ‘x1 tries x2 by x3.’ In A ‘lo nicte lo ckuliki cu troci nerkla’ correctly puts troci as the predicate (‘tried to enter’). B ‘nerkla troci’ misorders the brivla and sumti, violating troci’s valence. Thus A is supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_112:
The debater offers no legitimate quotes (all are marked <invalid_quote>) and thus provides no verifiable evidence for attitudinal placement or vocative order. Without any trustworthy citations from the text, their claim that B is correct is unsupported.


CoT Answer for jbo_113:
The two <verified_quote> entries show lo is a veridical descriptor ‘the one(s) that really is(are)…’ while loi marks the mass ‘the mass of individual(s)…’. To render “one of the couples is from Morocco,” we want a single couple, not the mass of couples. Thus pa lo spenysi'u cu se krasi lo morkygu'e (option A) correctly picks out one couple. No counter-evidence was provided. Therefore A is supported.


CoT Answer for jbo_116:
Neither side provided any verified quotes; both relied on <invalid_quote> tags, so there is no trustworthy evidence that A (with vei) is required. Without valid citations, we cannot accept the claim for A, so B is the better choice.


CoT Answer for jbo_118:
The debater’s key claims (use lo not zo for an object, lo re moi jufra for “the second sentence,” and se basti lo kabri for “is replaced by a cup”) are all supported by verified quotes from the reference. No counter‐evidence is given, so translation B is correct.
