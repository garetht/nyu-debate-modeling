## 2.16. Indicators
Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. “Aha!”, “Oh no!”, “Ouch!”, “Aahh!”, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.
Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left. For example:
**Example 2.79. **
.ie |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Agreement! |  I |  - |  go.  
Yep! I'll go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.80. **
.ei |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Obligation! |  I |  - |  go.  
I should go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.81. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  le melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go |  to-the beautiful-thing  
.ui |  [ku]  
---|---  
and I am happy because it is the beautiful thing I'm going to |  -  
  

Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison, the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means “and”.
**Example 2.82. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  You |  - |  stay.  
  

**Example 2.83. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ji'a |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  In addition, |  you |  - |  stay. |  added weight  
  

**Example 2.84. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ku'i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  However, |  you |  - |  stay. |  contrast  
  

Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”. Evidentials show the speaker's relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include __za'a__ (I directly observe the relationship), __pe'i__ (I believe that the relationship holds), __ru'a__ (I postulate the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.
**Example 2.85. **
pe'i |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I opine! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.  
  

**Example 2.86. **
za'a |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I directly observe! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.

## 2.11. Examples of brivla
The simplest form of selbri is an individual word. A word which may by itself express a selbri relation is called a __brivla__. The three types of brivla are gismu (root words), lujvo (compounds), and fu'ivla (borrowings from other languages). All have identical grammatical uses. So far, most of our selbri have been gismu or tanru built from gismu.
gismu:
**Example 2.46. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  ti |  zo'e |  zo'e |  ta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go-er |  - |  goes |  destination |  origin |  route |  means.  
I go here (to this) using that means (from somewhere via some route).  
---  
  

lujvo:
**Example 2.47. **
ta |  [cu] |  blari'o  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  is-blue-green.  
  

fu'ivla:
**Example 2.48. **
ti |  [cu] |  djarspageti  
---|---|---  
This |  - |  is-spaghetti.  
  

Some cmavo may also serve as selbri, acting as variables that stand for another selbri. The most commonly used of these is __go'i__ , which represents the main bridi of the previous Lojban sentence, with any new sumti or other sentence features being expressed replacing the previously expressed ones. Thus, in this context:
**Example 2.49. **
ta |  [cu] |  go'i  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  too/same-as-last selbri.  
That (is spaghetti), too.  
---

## 11.4. Property abstractions
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ka |  NU |  property abstractor  
---|---|---  
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
The things described by _le nu_ descriptions (or, to put it another way, the things of which __nu__ selbri may correctly be predicated) are only moderately “abstract”. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is “the property of being blue”, or “the property of being a go-er”? They are what logicians call “intensions”. If John has a heart, then “the property of having a heart” is an abstract object which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,
**Example 11.21. **
la | djan. | cu | se risna | zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-as-heart | something-unspecified.  
John has a heart.  
---  
  

has the same truth conditions as
**Example 11.22. **
la | djan. | cu | ckaji  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-the-property  
le | ka | se risna | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | having-as-heart | something.  
John has the property of having a heart.  
---  
  

(The English word “have” frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban properties: things are said to “have” properties, but this is not the same sense of “have” as in “I have money”, which is possession.)
Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:
**Example 11.23. **
do | cnino | mi | le | ka | xunre | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-new | to-me | in-the-quality-of-the | property-of | being-red.  
You are new to me in redness.  
---  
  

(The English suffix “-ness” often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix “-ity”.)
We can also move the property description to the x1 place of Example 11.23, producing:
**Example 11.24. **
le | ka | do | xunre | [kei] | cu | cnino | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | property-of | your | being-red |  |  | is-new | to me.  
Your redness is new to me.  
---  
  

It would be suitable to use Example 11.23 and Example 11.24 to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.
There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:
**Example 11.25. **
ka | mi | prami | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | me | loving | something-unspecified  
  

is quite different from
**Example 11.26. **
ka | [zo'e] | prami | mi | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | something-unspecified | loving | me  
  

In particular, sentences like Example 11.27 and Example 11.28 are quite different in meaning:
**Example 11.27. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami  
---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X)  
I love John more than I love George.  
---  
  

**Example 11.28. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka |  | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property of | (X | loves | me).  
John loves me more than George loves me.  
---  
  

The “X” used in the glosses of Example 11.27 through Example 11.28 as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in Section 11.2. Instead, the cmavo __ce'u__ of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)
Therefore, an explicit equivalent of Example 11.27, with no ellipsis, is:
**Example 11.29. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami | ce'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X).  
  

and of Example 11.28 is:
**Example 11.30. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | ce'u | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (X | loves | me).  
  

This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:
**Example 11.31. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of |  | giving | the | horse  
  

into
**Example 11.32. **
le | ka | ce'u | dunda | le | xirma |  | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | someone-unspecified | )  
the property of being a giver of the horse  
---  
  

which is the most natural interpretation of Example 11.31, versus
**Example 11.33. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma |  | ce'u | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (someone-unspecified | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | X | )  
the property of being one to whom the horse is given  
---  
  

which is also a possible interpretation.
It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction. Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri __bridi__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _bridi_ _ x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction) among arguments (sequence/set) x3
The place structure of __ka__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> _ _ka_ _ x1 is a property of (the bridi)

## 7.11. Abstraction focus pro-sumti: _ce'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __ce'u__ is used within abstraction bridi, particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo __ka__. Abstractions, including the uses of __ce'u__ , are discussed in full in Chapter 11.
In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using __ce'u__. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly between:
**Example 7.71. **
le | ka | ce'u | gleki  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | being-happy)  
the property of being happy  
---  
happiness  
  

and
**Example 7.72. **
le | ka | gleki | ce'u  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (being-happy-about | X)  
the property of being that which someone is happy about

## 5.12. Scalar negation of selbri
Negation is too large and complex a topic to explain fully in this chapter; see Chapter 15. In brief, there are two main types of negation in Lojban. This section is concerned with so-called “scalar negation”, which is used to state that a true relation between the sumti is something other than what the selbri specifies. Scalar negation is expressed by cmavo of selma'o NAhE:
**Example 5.116. **
la | .alis. | cu | na'e | ke | cadzu | klama | [ke'e] | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | non- | ( | walkingly | goes-to | ) | the | market.  
Alice doesn't walk to the market.  
---  
  

meaning that Alice's relationship to the market is something other than that of walking there. But if the __ke__ were omitted, the result would be:
**Example 5.117. **
la | .alis. | cu | na'e | cadzu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | non- | walkingly | goes-to | the | market.  
Alice doesn't walk to the market.  
---  
  

meaning that Alice does go there in some way (__klama__ is not negated), but by a means other than that of walking. Example 5.116 negates both __cadzu__ and __klama__ , suggesting that Alice's relation to the market is something different from walkingly-going; it might be walking without going, or going without walking, or neither.
Of course, any of the simple selbri types explained in Section 5.9 may be used in place of brivla in any of these examples:
**Example 5.118. **
la | djonz. | cu | na'e | pamoi | cusku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Jones |  | is-non- | 1st | speaker  
Jones is not the first speaker.  
---  
  

Since only __pamoi__ is negated, an appropriate inference is that he is some other kind of speaker.
Here is an assortment of more complex examples showing the interaction of scalar negation with __bo__ grouping, __ke__ and __ke'e__ grouping, logical connection, and sumti linked with __be__ and __bei__ :
**Example 5.119. **
mi | na'e | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | be'o | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | ((non- | quickly) | (walking |  | using | the | arms | )) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, walking using my arms other than quickly.  
---  
  

In Example 5.119, __na'e__ negates only __sutra__. Contrast Example 5.120:
**Example 5.120. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | [be'o]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | non- | ( | quickly | (walking |  | using | the | arms | )  
ke'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, other than by walking quickly on my arms.  
---  
  

Now consider Example 5.121 and Example 5.122, which are equivalent in meaning, but use __ke__ grouping and __bo__ grouping respectively:
**Example 5.121. **
mi | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | be'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | (quickly | (walking |  | using | the | arms | )  
je | masno | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, both quickly walking using my arms and slowly.  
---  
  

**Example 5.122. **
mi | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | [be'o] | ke'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | ( | (quickly | (walking |  | using | the | arms | ) | )  
je | masno | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, both quickly walking using my arms and slowly.  
---  
  

However, if we place a __na'e__ at the beginning of the selbri in both Example 5.121 and Example 5.122, we get different results:
**Example 5.123. **
mi | na'e | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | be'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | ((non- | quickly) | (walking |  | using | the | arms | )  
je | masno | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, both walking using my arms other than quickly, and also slowly.  
---  
  

**Example 5.124. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | [be'o] | ke'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | (non | ( | quickly | (walking |  | using | the | arms) |  | )  
je | masno | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, both other than quickly walking using my arms, and also slowly.  
---  
  

The difference arises because the __na'e__ in Example 5.124 negates the whole construction from __ke__ to __ke'e__ , whereas in Example 5.123 it negates __sutra__ alone.
Beware of omitting terminators in these complex examples! If the explicit __ke'e__ is left out in Example 5.124, it is transformed into:
**Example 5.125. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | be'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | non- | ( | quickly | ((walking |  | using | the | arms) | )  
je | masno | klama | [ke'e] | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | ) | the | market.  
I do something other than quickly both going to the market walking using my arms and slowly going to the market.  
---  
  

And if both __ke'e__ and __be'o__ are omitted, the results are even sillier:
**Example 5.126. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | je | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | non | ( | quickly | walk |  | on-my | (the | arm-type | and | slow)  
klama | [be'o] | [ke'e] | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
goers |  | ) | on-the | market.  
I do something other than quickly walking using the goers, both arm-type and slow, relative-to the market.  
---  
  

In Example 5.126, everything after __be__ is a linked sumti, so the place structure is that of __cadzu__ , whose x2 place is the surface walked upon. It is less than clear what an “arm-type goer” might be. Furthermore, since the x3 place has been occupied by the linked sumti, the _le zarci_ following the selbri falls into the nonexistent x4 place of __cadzu__. As a result, the whole example, though grammatical, is complete nonsense. (The bracketed Lojban words appear where a fluent Lojbanist would understand them to be implied.)
Finally, it is also possible to place __na'e__ before a __gu'e__ … __gi__ logically connected tanru construction. The meaning of this usage has not yet been firmly established.

This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 6.2. The three basic description types
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
le |  LE |  the, the one(s) described as  
---|---|---  
lo |  LE |  some, some of those which really are  
la |  LA |  the one(s) named  
ku |  KU |  elidable terminator for LE, LA  
The syntax of descriptions is fairly complex, and not all of it can be explained within the confines of this chapter: relative clauses, in particular, are discussed in Chapter 8. However, most descriptions have just two components: a descriptor belonging to selma'o LE or LA, and a selbri. (The difference between selma'o LE and selma'o LA is not important until Section 6.12.) Furthermore, the selbri is often just a single brivla. Here is an elementary example:
**Example 6.5. **
le | zarci  
---|---  
one-or-more-specific-things-each-of-which-I-describe-as | being-a-market  
the market  
---  
  

The long gloss for __le__ is of course far too long to use most of the time, and in fact __le__ is quite close in meaning to English “the”. It has particular implications, however, which “the” does not have.
The general purpose of all descriptors is to create a sumti which might occur in the x1 place of the selbri belonging to the description. Thus _le zarci_ conveys something which might be found in the x1 place of __zarci__ , namely a market.
The specific purpose of __le__ is twofold. First, it indicates that the speaker has one or more specific markets in mind (whether or not the listener knows which ones they are). Second, it also indicates that the speaker is merely describing the things he or she has in mind as markets, without being committed to the truth of that description.
**Example 6.6. **
le | zarci | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---  
One-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe-as |  “markets” |  | is/are-big.  
The market is big.  
---  
The markets are big.  
  

Note that English-speakers must state whether a reference to markets is to just one (“the market”) or to more than one (“the markets”). Lojban requires no such forced choice, so both colloquial translations of Example 6.6 are valid. Only the context can specify which is meant. (This rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of specifying the number of markets in such a case: that mechanism is explained in Section 6.7.)
Now consider the following strange-looking example:
**Example 6.7. **
le | nanmu | cu | ninmu  
---|---|---|---  
One-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe-as |  “men” |  | is/are-women.  
The man is a woman.  
---  
The men are women.  
  

Example 6.7 is not self-contradictory in Lojban, because _le nanmu_ merely means something or other which, for my present purposes, I choose to describe as a man, whether or not it really is a man. A plausible instance would be: someone we had assumed to be a man at a distance turned out to be actually a woman on closer observation. Example 6.7 is what I would say to point out my observation to you.
In all descriptions with __le__ , the listener is presumed to either know what I have in mind or else not to be concerned at present (perhaps I will give more identifying details later). In particular, I might be pointing at the supposed man or men: Example 6.7 would then be perfectly intelligible, since _le nanmu_ merely clarifies that I am pointing at the supposed man, not at a landscape, or a nose, which happens to lie in the same direction.
The second descriptor dealt with in this section is __lo__. Unlike __le__ , __lo__ is nonspecific:
**Example 6.8. **
lo | zarci  
---|---  
one-or-more-of-all-the-things-which-really | are-markets  
a market  
---  
some markets  
  

Again, there are two colloquial English translations. The effect of using __lo__ in Example 6.8 is to refer generally to one or more markets, without being specific about which. Unlike _le zarci_ , _lo zarci_ must refer to something which actually is a market (that is, which can appear in the x1 place of a truthful bridi whose selbri is __zarci__). Thus
**Example 6.9. **
lo | nanmu | cu | ninmu  
---|---|---|---  
That-which-really-is | a-man |  | is-a-woman.  
Some man is a woman.  
---  
Some men are women.  
  

must be false in Lojban, given that there are no objects in the real world which are both men and women. Pointing at some specific men or women would not make Example 6.9 true, because those specific individuals are no more both-men-and-women than any others. In general, __lo__ refers to whatever individuals meet its description.
The last descriptor of this section is __la__ , which indicates that the selbri which follows it has been dissociated from its normal meaning and is being used as a name. Like __le__ descriptions, __la__ descriptions are implicitly restricted to those I have in mind. (Do not confuse this use of __la__ with its use before regular Lojbanized names, which is discussed in Section 6.12.) For example:
**Example 6.10. **
la | cribe | pu | finti | le | lisri  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named |  “bear” | [past] | creates | the | story.  
Bear wrote the story.  
---  
  

In Example 6.10, _la cribe_ refers to someone whose naming predicate is __cribe__ , i.e. “Bear”. In English, most names don't mean anything, or at least not anything obvious. The name “Frank” coincides with the English word “frank”, meaning “honest”, and so one way of translating “Frank ate some cheese” into Lojban would be:
**Example 6.11. **
la | stace | pu | citka | lo | cirla  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named |  “Honest/Frank” | [past] | eats | some | cheese.  
  

English-speakers typically would not do this, as we tend to be more attached to the sound of our names than their meaning, even if the meaning (etymological or current) is known. Speakers of other languages may feel differently. (In point of fact, “Frank” originally meant “the free one” rather than “the honest one”.)
It is important to note the differences between Example 6.10 and the following:
**Example 6.12. **
le | cribe | pu | finti | le | lisri  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
One-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe-as | bears | [past] | creates | the | story.  
The bear(s) wrote the story.  
---  
  

**Example 6.13. **
lo | cribe | pu | finti | le | lisri  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
One-or-more-of-the-things-which-really | are-bears | [past] | creates | the | story.  
A bear wrote the story.  
---  
Some bears wrote the story.  
  

Example 6.12 is about a specific bear or bearlike thing(s), or thing(s) which the speaker (perhaps whimsically or metaphorically) describes as a bear (or more than one); Example 6.13 is about one or more of the really existing, objectively defined bears. In either case, though, each of them must have contributed to the writing of the story, if more than one bear (or “bear”) is meant.
(The notion of a “really existing, objectively defined bear” raises certain difficulties. Is a panda bear a “real bear”? How about a teddy bear? In general, the answer is “yes”. Lojban gismu are defined as broadly as possible, allowing tanru and lujvo to narrow down the definition. There probably are no necessary and sufficient conditions for defining what is and what is not a bear that can be pinned down with complete precision: the real world is fuzzy. In borderline cases, __le__ may communicate better than __lo__.)
So while Example 6.10 could easily be true (there is a real writer named “Greg Bear”), and Example 6.12 could be true if the speaker is sufficiently peculiar in what he or she describes as a bear, Example 6.13 is certainly false.
Similarly, compare the following two examples, which are analogous to Example 6.12 and Example 6.13 respectively:
**Example 6.14. **
le | remna | pu | finti | le | lisri  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Those-described-as | a-human | [past] | writes | that-described-as | a-story.  
The human being(s) wrote the story.  
---  
  

**Example 6.15. **
lo | remna | pu | finti | le | lisri  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-which-really-is | a-human | [past] | writes | that-described-as | a-story.  
A human being wrote the story.  
---  
Some human beings wrote the story.  
  

Example 6.14 says who the author of the story is: one or more particular human beings that the speaker has in mind. If the topic of conversation is the story, then Example 6.14 identifies the author as someone who can be pointed out or who has been previously mentioned; whereas if the topic is a person, then _le remna_ is in effect a shorthand reference to that person. Example 6.15 merely says that the author is human.
The elidable terminator for all descriptions is __ku__. It can almost always be omitted with no danger of ambiguity. The main exceptions are in certain uses of relative clauses, which are discussed in Section 8.6, and in the case of a description immediately preceding the selbri. In this latter case, using an explicit __cu__ before the selbri makes the __ku__ unnecessary. There are also a few other uses of __ku__ : in the compound negator _naku_ (discussed in Chapter 16) and to terminate place-structure, tense, and modal tags that do not have associated sumti (discussed in Chapter 9 and Chapter 10).

## 9.16. CV'V cmavo of selma'o BAI with irregular forms
There are 65 cmavo of selma'o BAI, of which all but one (__do'e__ , discussed in Section 9.6), are derived directly from selected gismu. Of these 64 cmavo, 36 are entirely regular and have the form CV'V, where C is the first consonant of the corresponding gismu, and the Vs are the two vowels of the gismu. The remaining BAI cmavo, which are irregular in one way or another, are listed in the table below. The table is divided into sub-tables according to the nature of the exception; some cmavo appear in more than one sub-table, and are so noted.

## 9.4. Conversion: SE
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
se |  SE |  2nd place conversion  
---|---|---  
te |  SE |  3rd place conversion  
ve |  SE |  4th place conversion  
xe |  SE |  5th place conversion  
So far we have seen ways to move sumti around within a bridi, but the actual place structure of the selbri has always remained untouched. The conversion cmavo of selma'o SE are incorporated within the selbri itself, and produce a new selbri (called a converted selbri) with a different place structure. In particular, after the application of any SE cmavo, the number and purposes of the places remain the same, but two of them have been exchanged, the x1 place and another. Which place has been exchanged with x1 depends on the cmavo chosen. Thus, for example, when __se__ is used, the x1 place is swapped with the x2 place.
Note that the cmavo of SE begin with consecutive consonants in alphabetical order. There is no “1st place conversion” cmavo, because exchanging the x1 place with itself is a pointless maneuver.
Here are the place structures of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the destination of x2's going from x3 via x4 using x5
and _te klama_ :
> x1 is the origin and x2 the destination of x3 going via x4 using x5
and _ve klama_ :
> x1 is the route to x2 from x3 used by x4 going via x5
and _xe klama_ :
> x1 is the means in going to x2 from x3 via x4 employed by x5
Note that the place structure numbers in each case continue to be listed in the usual order, x1 to x5.
Consider the following pair of examples:
**Example 9.18. **
la | bastn. | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Boston |  | is-the-destination | of-me.  
Boston is my destination.  
---  
Boston is gone to by me.  
  

**Example 9.19. **
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I.  
To Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.18 and Example 9.19 mean the same thing, in the sense that there is a relationship of going with the speaker as the agent and Boston as the destination (and with unspecified origin, route, and means). Structurally, however, they are quite different. Example 9.18 has _la bastn._ in the x1 place and __mi__ in the x2 place of the selbri _se klama_ , and uses standard bridi order; Example 9.19 has __mi__ in the x1 place and _la bastn._ in the x2 place of the selbri __klama__ , and uses a non-standard order.
The most important use of conversion is in the construction of descriptions. A description is a sumti which begins with a cmavo of selma'o LA or LE, called the descriptor, and contains (in the simplest case) a selbri. We have already seen the descriptions _le dargu_ and _le karce_. To this we could add:
**Example 9.20. **
le | klama  
---|---  
the go-er, the one who goes  
---  
  

In every case, the description is about something which fits into the x1 place of the selbri. In order to get a description of a destination (that is, something fitting the x2 place of __klama__), we must convert the selbri to _se klama_ , whose x1 place is a destination. The result is
**Example 9.21. **
le | se | klama  
---|---|---  
the destination gone to by someone  
---  
  

Likewise, we can create three more converted descriptions:
**Example 9.22. **
le | te | klama  
---|---|---  
the origin of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.23. **
le | ve | klama  
---|---|---  
the route of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.24. **
le | xe | klama  
---|---|---  
the means by which someone goes  
---  
  

Example 9.23 does not mean “the route” plain and simple: that is _le pluta_ , using a different selbri. It means a route that is used by someone for an act of __klama__ ; that is, a journey with origin and destination. A “road” on Mars, on which no one has traveled or is ever likely to, may be called _le pluta_ , but it cannot be _le ve klama_ , since there exists no one for whom it is _le ve klama be fo da_ (the route taken in an actual journey by someone [da]).
When converting selbri that are more complex than a single brivla, it is important to realize that the scope of a SE cmavo is only the following brivla (or equivalent unit). In order to convert an entire tanru, it is necessary to enclose the tanru in __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets:
**Example 9.25. **
mi | se | ke | blanu | zdani | [ke'e] | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [2nd-conversion] | ( | blue | house | ) | this-thing  
  

The place structure of _blanu zdani_ (blue house) is the same as that of __zdani__ , by the rule given in Section 9.1. The place structure of __zdani__ is:
> _ _zdani_ _ x1 is a house/nest/lair/den for inhabitant x2
The place structure of _se ke blanu zdani [ke'e]_ is therefore:
> x1 is the inhabitant of the blue house (etc.) x2
Consequently, Example 9.25 means:
> I am the inhabitant of the blue house which is this thing.
Conversion applied to only part of a tanru has subtler effects which are explained in Section 5.11.
It is grammatical to convert a selbri more than once with SE; later (inner) conversions are applied before earlier (outer) ones. For example, the place structure of _se te klama_ is achieved by exchanging the x1 and x2 place of _te klama_ , producing:
> x1 is the destination and x2 is the origin of x3 going via x4 using x5
On the other hand, _te se klama_ has a place structure derived from swapping the x1 and x3 places of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the origin of x2's going to x3 via x4 using x5
which is quite different. However, multiple conversions like this are never necessary. Arbitrary scrambling of places can be achieved more easily and far more intelligibly with FA tags, and only a single conversion is ever needed in a description.
(Although no one has made any real use of it, it is perhaps worth noting that compound conversions of the form _setese_ , where the first and third cmavo are the same, effectively swap the two given places while leaving the others, including x1, alone: _setese_ (or equivalently _tesete_) swap the x2 and x3 places, whereas _texete_ (or _xetexe_) swap the x3 and x5 places.)

## 5.11. Conversion of simple selbri
Conversion is the process of changing a selbri so that its places appear in a different order. This is not the same as labeling the sumti with the cmavo of FA, as mentioned in Section 5.7, and then rearranging the order in which the sumti are spoken or written. Conversion transforms the selbri into a distinct, though closely related, selbri with renumbered places.
In Lojban, conversion is accomplished by placing a cmavo of selma'o SE before the selbri:
**Example 5.109. **
mi | prami | do  
---|---|---  
I love you.  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 5.110. **
do | se | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---  
You | [swap x1 and x2] | love | me.  
You are loved by me.  
---  
  

Conversion is fully explained in Section 9.4. For the purposes of this chapter, the important point about conversion is that it applies only to the following simple selbri. When trying to convert a tanru, therefore, it is necessary to be careful! Consider Example 5.111:
**Example 5.111. **
la | .alis. | cu | cadzu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | is-a-walker | type-of-goer-to | the | market.  
That-named | Alice |  | walkingly | goes-to | the | market.  
Alice walks to the market.  
---  
  

To convert this sentence so that _le zarci_ is in the x1 place, one correct way is:
**Example 5.112. **
le | zarci | cu | se  
---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-a-[swap x1/x2]  
The | market |  |   
ke | cadzu | klama | [ke'e] | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | walker | type-of-goer-to | ) | that-named | Alice.  
| is-walkingly | gone-to-by |  | that-named | Alice.  
  

The __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets cause the entire tanru to be converted by the __se__ , which would otherwise convert only __cadzu__ , leading to:
**Example 5.113. **
le | zarci | cu | se | cadzu  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | (is-a-[swap x1/x2] | walker)  
The | market |  |  | is-a-walking-surface  
klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
  

whatever that might mean. An alternative approach, since the place structure of _cadzu klama_ is that of __klama__ alone, is to convert only the latter:
**Example 5.114. **
le | zarci | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice.  
  

But the tanru in Example 5.114 may or may not have the same meaning as that in Example 5.111; in particular, because __cadzu__ is not converted, there is a suggestion that although Alice is the goer, the market is the walker. With a different sumti as x1, this seemingly odd interpretation might make considerable sense:
**Example 5.115. **
la | djan. | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice  
  

suggests that Alice is going to John, who is a moving target.
There is an alternative type of conversion, using the cmavo __jai__ of selma'o JAI optionally followed by a modal or tense construction. Grammatically, such a combination behaves exactly like conversion using SE. More details can be found in Section 9.12.

## 11.5. Amount abstractions
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
ni |  NU |  amount abstraction  
---|---|---  
Amount abstractions are far more limited than event or property abstractions. They really make sense only if the selbri of the abstracted bridi is subject to measurement of some sort. Thus we can speak of:
**Example 11.34. **
le | ni | le | pixra | cu | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | amount-of | (the | picture |  | being-blue | )  
the amount of blueness in the picture  
---  
  

because “blueness” could be measured with a colorimeter or a similar device. However,
**Example 11.35. **
le | ni | la | djein. | cu | mamta | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | amount-of | (that-named | Jane |  | being-a-mother | )  
the amount of Jane's mother-ness (?)  
---  
the amount of mother-ness in Jane (?)  
  

makes very little sense in either Lojban or English. We simply do not have any sort of measurement scale for being a mother.
Semantically, a sumti with _le ni_ is a number; however, it cannot be treated grammatically as a quantifier in Lojban unless prefixed by the mathematical cmavo __mo'e__ :
**Example 11.36. **
li | pa | vu'u | mo'e | le | ni |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 1 | minus | the-operand | the | amount-of | (  
le | pixra | cu | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | picture |  | being-blue | )  
1 - B, where `B` = blueness of the picture  
---  
  

Mathematical Lojban is beyond the scope of this chapter, and is explained more fully in Chapter 18.
There are contexts where either property or amount abstractions make sense, and in such constructions, amount abstractions can make use of __ce'u__ just like property abstractors. Thus,
**Example 11.37. **
le | pixra | cu | cenba | le | ka | ce'u | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | picture |  | varies | in-the | property-of | (X | is blue | ).  
The picture varies in being blue.  
---  
The picture varies in blueness.  
  

is not the same as
**Example 11.38. **
le | pixra | cu | cenba | le | ni | ce'u | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | picture |  | varies | in-the | amount-of | (X | is blue | ).  
The picture varies in how blue it is.  
---  
The picture varies in blueness.  
  

Example 11.37 conveys that the blueness comes and goes, whereas Example 11.38 conveys that its quantity changes over time.
Whenever we talk of measurement of an amount, there is some sort of scale, and so the place structure of __ni__ abstraction selbri is:
> _ _ni_ _ x1 is the amount of (the bridi) on scale x2
Note: the best way to express the x2 places of abstract sumti is to use something like _le ni ... kei be_. See Example 11.62 for the use of this construction.

## 10.22. Conversion of sumti tcita: JAI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
jai |  JAI |  tense conversion  
---|---|---  
fai |  FA |  indefinite place  
Conversion is the regular Lojban process of moving around the places of a place structure. The cmavo of selma'o SE serve this purpose, exchanging the first place with one of the others:
**Example 10.162. **
mi | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | go-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.163. **
le | zarci | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-gone-to | by-me.  
  

It is also possible to bring a place that is specified by a sumti tcita (for the purposes of this chapter, a tense sumti tcita) to the front, by using __jai__ plus the tense as the grammatical equivalent of SE:
**Example 10.164. **
le | ratcu | cu | citka | le | cirla | vi | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | rat |  | eats | the | cheese | [short-distance] | the | park.  
The rat eats the cheese in the park.  
---  
  

**Example 10.165. **
le | panka | cu | jai vi | citka | le | cirla | fai | le | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | park |  | is-the-place-of | eating | the | cheese | by | the | rat.  
The park is where the rat eats the cheese.  
---  
  

In Example 10.165, the construction JAI+tense converts the location sumti into the first place. The previous first place has nowhere to go, since the location sumti is not a numbered place; however, it can be inserted back into the bridi with __fai__ , the indefinite member of selma'o FA.
(The other members of FA are used to mark the first, second, etc. places of a bridi explicitly:
**Example 10.166. **
fa mi cu klama fe le zarci
  

means the same as
**Example 10.167. **
fe le zarci cu klama fa mi
  

as well as the simple
**Example 10.168. **
mi cu klama le zarci
  

in which the place structure is determined by position.)
Like SE conversion, JAI+tense conversion is especially useful in descriptions with LE selma'o:
**Example 10.169. **
mi | viska | le | jai vi | citka | be | le | cirla  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | place-of | eating |  | the | cheese.  
  

Here the eater of the cheese is elided, so no __fai__ appears.
Of course, temporal tenses are also usable with JAI:
**Example 10.170. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | jai | ca | morsi | be | fai | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the |  | [present] | is-dead |  | of | that-named |  “John” | .  
I know the time of John's death.  
---  
I know when John died.

## 9.12. Modal conversion: JAI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
jai |  JAI |  modal conversion  
---|---|---  
fai |  FA |  modal place structure tag  
So far, conversion of numbered bridi places with SE and the addition of modal places with BAI have been two entirely separate operations. However, it is possible to convert a selbri in such a way that, rather than exchanging two numbered places, a modal place is made into a numbered place. For example,
**Example 9.82. **
mi | cusku |  | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | [something] | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

has an explicit x1 place occupied by __mi__ and an explicit __bau__ place occupied by _la lojban._ To exchange these two, we use a modal conversion operator consisting of __jai__ (of selma'o JAI) followed by the modal cmavo. Thus, the modal conversion of Example 9.82 is:
**Example 9.83. **
la | lojban. | jai bau cusku | fai | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Lojban | is-the-language-of-expression | used-by | me.  
  

In Example 9.83, the modal place _la lojban._ has become the x1 place of the new selbri _jai bau cusku_. What has happened to the old x1 place? There is no numbered place for it to move to, so it moves to a special “unnumbered place” marked by the tag __fai__ of selma'o FA.
Note: For the purposes of place numbering, __fai__ behaves like __fi'a__ ; it does not affect the numbering of the other places around it.
Like SE conversions, JAI conversions are especially convenient in descriptions. We may refer to “the language of an expression” as _le jai bau cusku_ , for example.
In addition, it is grammatical to use __jai__ without a following modal. This usage is not related to modals, but is explained here for completeness. The effect of __jai__ by itself is to send the x1 place, which should be an abstraction, into the __fai__ position, and to raise one of the sumti from the abstract sub-bridi into the x1 place of the main bridi. This feature is discussed in more detail in Section 11.10. The following two examples mean the same thing:
**Example 9.84. **
le | nu | mi | lebna | le | cukta | cu | se krinu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | (I | take | the | book) |  | is-justified-by  
le | nu | mi | viska | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | (I | see | the | book).  
My taking the book is justified by my seeing it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.85. **
mi | jai se krinu | le | nu | mi | viska | le | cukta | kei  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-justified-by | the | event-of | (I | see | the | book) |   
[fai | le | nu | mi | lebna | le | cukta]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[namely, | the | event-of | (I | take | the | book)]  
I am justified in taking the book by seeing the book.  
---  
  

Example 9.85, with the bracketed part omitted, allows us to say that “I am justified” whereas in fact it is my action that is justified. This construction is vague, but useful in representing natural-language methods of expression.
Note: The uses of modals discussed in this section are applicable both to BAI modals and to _fi'o-_ plus-selbri modals.

 Here is the topic you will be debating:

Consider the English sentence "The picture was made to shock visitors."
Which of the following is a better translation of this sentence into standard Lojban?

(A) lo pixra cu se finti lo ka jai spaji lo vitke
(B) lo pixra cu se finti fi lo ka jai spaji lo vitke

Exactly one of the answers above is correct. Please indicate the single letter corresponding to the correct answer (A or B).
Answer:

Debater_A will defend the position that the answer is "lo pixra cu se finti fi lo ka jai spaji lo vitke".
Debater_B will defend the position that the answer is "lo pixra cu se finti lo ka jai spaji lo vitke".


You are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. 
- You should defend your position that the answer is "lo pixra cu se finti lo ka jai spaji lo vitke" while attacking Debater_A's position. 


Exactly one of the answers above is correct. Please provide your response in JSON format, including an 'answer' (A or B) field for the final result and a 'cot' (chain of thought) field explaining your reasoning
