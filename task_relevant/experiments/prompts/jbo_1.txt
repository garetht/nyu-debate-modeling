## 14.7. More than two propositions
So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.
Of the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,
**Example 14.31. **
mi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,
**Example 14.32. **
mi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that one or more of the component sentences is true.
O, however, is different. Working out the truth table for
**Example 14.33. **
mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  
  

shows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:
> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.
Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.
In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.
There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: 
**Example 14.34. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  
.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

Does this mean:
**Example 14.35. **
I like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.
  

Or is the correct translation:
**Example 14.36. **
Either I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.
  

Example 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:
**Example 14.37. **
ga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | I | like | that-named | Martha)  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas
**Example 14.38. **
ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary).  
  

is not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.

## 14.8. Grouping of afterthought connectives
There are several ways in Lojban to render Example 14.35 using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo __bo__ (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with __bo__ are interpreted before connections not so marked. Example 14.39 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.38:
**Example 14.39. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John, | and | I | like | that-named | Martha  
.ijabo | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by __.i__ __ja__ first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by __.i__ __je__.
Eks can have __bo__ attached in exactly the same way, so that Example 14.40 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39:
**Example 14.40. **
mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with __bo__ , for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.
What happens if __bo__ is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in Example 14.41?
**Example 14.41. **
mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Does this wind up meaning the same as Example 14.34 and Example 14.36? Not at all. A second rule relating to __bo__ is that where several __bo__ -marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, Example 14.41 in fact means the same as Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with __bo__ should be avoided.
The use of __bo__ , therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of Example 14.37 and Example 14.38, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ are used with ijeks, and __ke__ and __ke'e__ with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (__ke__ and __ke'e__ are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.42. **
I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
  

where the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express Example 14.42 in afterthought, we can say:
**Example 14.43. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije[bo] | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me,  
.ijanai | mi | prami | do | .ijebo | do | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | I | love | you | and | you | love | me.  
  

marking two of the ijeks with __bo__ for high precedence. (The first __bo__ is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)
But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:
**Example 14.44. **
tu'e | mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me | )  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

where the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ pairs set off the structure. The cmavo __tu'u__ is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in Example 14.44 is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.
In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to __bo__ grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.
Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:
**Example 14.45. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider
**Example 14.46. **
I walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.
  

Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to Example 14.44, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with __ke__ , so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing Example 14.47, which is instead parallel to Example 14.45:
**Example 14.47. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | the | house  
.a | ke | le | ckule | .e | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | the | school | and | the | office | ).  
  

If sumti were allowed to begin with __ke__ , unavoidable ambiguities would result, so __ke__ grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to __tu'e__ grouping of bridi, as Example 14.44 shows.
Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of Example 14.33: “I am German, rich, and a man – or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:
**Example 14.48. **
[tu'e] | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-rich | )  
.ije | tu'e | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | nanmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | ( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-a-man | ).  
  

The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.

## 11.4. Property abstractions
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ka |  NU |  property abstractor  
---|---|---  
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
The things described by _le nu_ descriptions (or, to put it another way, the things of which __nu__ selbri may correctly be predicated) are only moderately “abstract”. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is “the property of being blue”, or “the property of being a go-er”? They are what logicians call “intensions”. If John has a heart, then “the property of having a heart” is an abstract object which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,
**Example 11.21. **
la | djan. | cu | se risna | zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-as-heart | something-unspecified.  
John has a heart.  
---  
  

has the same truth conditions as
**Example 11.22. **
la | djan. | cu | ckaji  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-the-property  
le | ka | se risna | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | having-as-heart | something.  
John has the property of having a heart.  
---  
  

(The English word “have” frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban properties: things are said to “have” properties, but this is not the same sense of “have” as in “I have money”, which is possession.)
Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:
**Example 11.23. **
do | cnino | mi | le | ka | xunre | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-new | to-me | in-the-quality-of-the | property-of | being-red.  
You are new to me in redness.  
---  
  

(The English suffix “-ness” often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix “-ity”.)
We can also move the property description to the x1 place of Example 11.23, producing:
**Example 11.24. **
le | ka | do | xunre | [kei] | cu | cnino | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | property-of | your | being-red |  |  | is-new | to me.  
Your redness is new to me.  
---  
  

It would be suitable to use Example 11.23 and Example 11.24 to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.
There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:
**Example 11.25. **
ka | mi | prami | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | me | loving | something-unspecified  
  

is quite different from
**Example 11.26. **
ka | [zo'e] | prami | mi | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | something-unspecified | loving | me  
  

In particular, sentences like Example 11.27 and Example 11.28 are quite different in meaning:
**Example 11.27. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami  
---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X)  
I love John more than I love George.  
---  
  

**Example 11.28. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka |  | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property of | (X | loves | me).  
John loves me more than George loves me.  
---  
  

The “X” used in the glosses of Example 11.27 through Example 11.28 as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in Section 11.2. Instead, the cmavo __ce'u__ of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)
Therefore, an explicit equivalent of Example 11.27, with no ellipsis, is:
**Example 11.29. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami | ce'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X).  
  

and of Example 11.28 is:
**Example 11.30. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | ce'u | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (X | loves | me).  
  

This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:
**Example 11.31. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of |  | giving | the | horse  
  

into
**Example 11.32. **
le | ka | ce'u | dunda | le | xirma |  | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | someone-unspecified | )  
the property of being a giver of the horse  
---  
  

which is the most natural interpretation of Example 11.31, versus
**Example 11.33. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma |  | ce'u | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (someone-unspecified | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | X | )  
the property of being one to whom the horse is given  
---  
  

which is also a possible interpretation.
It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction. Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri __bridi__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _bridi_ _ x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction) among arguments (sequence/set) x3
The place structure of __ka__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> _ _ka_ _ x1 is a property of (the bridi)

## 7.11. Abstraction focus pro-sumti: _ce'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __ce'u__ is used within abstraction bridi, particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo __ka__. Abstractions, including the uses of __ce'u__ , are discussed in full in Chapter 11.
In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using __ce'u__. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly between:
**Example 7.71. **
le | ka | ce'u | gleki  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | being-happy)  
the property of being happy  
---  
happiness  
  

and
**Example 7.72. **
le | ka | gleki | ce'u  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (being-happy-about | X)  
the property of being that which someone is happy about

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 10.15. Tenses in subordinate bridi
English has a set of rules, formally known as “sequence of tense rules”, for determining what tense should be used in a subordinate clause, depending on the tense used in the main sentence. Here are some examples:
**Example 10.100. **
John says that George is going to the market.
  

**Example 10.101. **
John says that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.102. **
John said that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.103. **
John said that George had gone to the market.
  

In Example 10.100 and Example 10.101, the tense of the main sentence is the present: “says”. If George goes when John speaks, we get the present tense “is going” (“goes” would be unidiomatic); if George goes before John speaks, we get the past tense “went”. But if the tense of the main sentence is the past, with “said”, then the tense required in the subordinate clause is different. If George goes when John speaks, we get the past tense “went”; if George goes before John speaks, we get the past-perfect tense “had gone”.
The rule of English, therefore, is that both the tense of the main sentence and the tense of the subordinate clause are understood relative to the speaker of the main sentence (not John, but the person who speaks Example 10.100 through Example 10.103).
Lojban, like Russian and Esperanto, uses a different convention. A tense in a subordinate bridi is understood to be relative to the tense already set in the main bridi. Thus Example 10.100 through Example 10.103 can be expressed in Lojban respectively thus:
**Example 10.104. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.105. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.106. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.107. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

Probably the most counterintuitive of the Lojban examples is Example 10.106. The __ca__ looks quite odd, as if George were going to the market right now, rather than back when John spoke. But this __ca__ is really a __ca__ with respect to a reference point specified by the outer __pu__. This behavior is the same as the additive behavior of multiple tenses in the same bridi, as explained in Section 10.13.
There is a special cmavo __nau__ (of selma'o CUhE) which can be used to override these rules and get to the speaker's current reference point. (Yes, it sounds like English “now”.) It is not grammatical to combine __nau__ with any other cmavo in a tense, except by way of a logical or non-logical connection (see Section 10.20). Here is a convoluted sentence with several nested bridi which uses __nau__ at the lowest level:
**Example 10.108. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | .alis | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | maris. | nau | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Mary | [now] | goes-to | the | market.  
John said that Alice had said that George had earlier said that Mary is now going to the market.  
---  
  

The use of __nau__ does not affect sticky tenses.

## 11.7. Predication/sentence abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
du'u |  NU |  predication abstraction  
---|---|---  
There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:
**Example 11.42. **
I know that Frank is a fool.
  

How's that in Lojban? Let us try:
**Example 11.43. **
mi | djuno | le | nu | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the event of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can't be contained inside one's mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; Example 11.43 comes close to claiming that Frank's being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, Example 11.43 is an instance of improperly marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in Section 11.10).
Try again:
**Example 11.44. **
mi | djuno | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Closer. Example 11.44 says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn't say that he is one, as Example 11.42 does. To catch that nuance, we must say:
**Example 11.45. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the predication that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a fool” is not a property of _le du'u_ abstraction, but of __djuno__ ; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, __djuno__ like __jei__ has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) Example 11.46 has no such implied assertion:
**Example 11.46. **
mi | kucli | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

and here __du'u__ could probably be replaced by __jei__ without much change in meaning:
**Example 11.47. **
mi | kucli | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about how true it is that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, __du'u__ has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:
> _ _du'u_ _ x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2
and _le se du'u ..._ is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:
**Example 11.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | le | se du'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses | the | (sentence-expressing-that  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes-to | the | store | )  
John says that George goes to the store.  
---  
  

Example 11.48 differs from
**Example 11.49. **
la | djan | cusku | lu  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses, | quote,  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes | to-the | store, | unquote.  
John says “George goes to the store”.  
---  
  

because Example 11.49 claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas Example 11.48 claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.
_le se du'u_ is much the same as _lu'e le du'u_ , a symbol for the predication, but _se du'u_ can be used as a selbri, whereas __lu'e__ is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See Section 6.10 for a discussion of __lu'e__.)

## 14.19. Abstractor connection and connection within abstractions
Last and (as a matter of fact) least: a logical connective is allowed between abstraction markers of selma'o NU. As usual, the connection can be expanded to a bridi connection between two bridi which differ only in abstraction marker. Jeks are the appropriate connective. Example 14.170 and Example 14.171 are equivalent in meaning:
**Example 14.170. **
le | ka | la | frank. | ciska | cu | xlali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | quality-of | that-named | Frank's | writing |  | is-bad,  
.ije | le | ni | la | frank. | ciska | cu | xlali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | the | quantity-of | that-named | Frank's | writing |  | is-bad.  
  

**Example 14.171. **
le | ka | je | ni | la | frank. | ciska | cu | xlali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | quality | and | quantity | of | that-named | Frank's | writing |  | is-bad.  
  

As with tenses and modals, there is no forethought and no way to override the left-grouping rule.
Logical connectives and abstraction are related in another way as well, though. Since an abstraction contains a bridi, the bridi may have a logical connection inside it. Is it legitimate to split the outer bridi into two, joined by the logical connection? Absolutely not. For example:
**Example 14.172. **
mi | jinvi | le | du'u | loi | jmive  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | opine | the | fact-that | a-mass-of | living-things  
cu | zvati | gi'onai | na | zvati | vau | la | .iupiter.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| (is-at | or-else | is-not | at) |  | that-named | Jupiter.  
I believe there either is or isn't life on Jupiter.  
---  
  

is true, since the embedded sentence is a tautology, but:
**Example 14.173. **
mi | jinvi | le | du'u | loi | jmive | cu | zvati | la | .iupiter.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | opine | the | fact-that | a-mass-of | living-things |  | is-at | that-named | Jupiter  
.ijonai | mi | jinvi | le | du'u | loi | jmive  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or-else | I | opine | the | fact-that | a-mass-of | living-things  
cu | zvati | la | .iupiter.  
---|---|---|---  
| isn't-at | that-named | Jupiter  
  

is false, since I have no evidence one way or the other (__jinvi__ requires some sort of evidence, real or fancied, unlike __krici__).

## 10.13. Sticky and multiple tenses: KI
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
ki |  KI |  sticky tense set/reset  
---|---|---  
So far we have only considered tenses in isolated bridi. Lojban provides several ways for a tense to continue in effect over more than a single bridi. This property is known as “stickiness”: the tense gets “stuck” and remains in effect until explicitly “unstuck”. In the metaphor of the imaginary journey, the place and time set by a sticky tense may be thought of as a campsite or way-station: it provides a permanent origin with respect to which other tenses are understood. Later imaginary journeys start from that point rather than from the speaker.
To make a tense sticky, suffix __ki__ to it:
**Example 10.82. **
mi | puki | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past-sticky] | go-to | the | market.  
.i | le | nanmu | cu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| The | man |  | bites | the | dog.  
I went to the market. The man bit the dog.  
---  
  

Here the use of _puki_ rather than just __pu__ ensures that the tense will affect the next sentence as well. Otherwise, since the second sentence is tenseless, there would be no way of determining its tense; the event of the second sentence might happen before, after, or simultaneously with that of the first sentence.
(The last statement does not apply when the two sentences form part of a narrative. See Section 10.14 for an explanation of “story time”, which employs a different set of conventions.)
What if the second sentence has a tense anyway?
**Example 10.83. **
mi | puki | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past-sticky] | go-to | the | market.  
.i | le | nanmu | pu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| The | man | [past] | bites | the | dog.  
  

Here the second __pu__ does not replace the sticky tense, but adds to it, in the sense that the starting point of its imaginary journey is taken to be the previously set sticky time. So the translation of Example 10.83 is:
**Example 10.84. **
I went to the market. The man had earlier bitten the dog.
  

and it is equivalent in meaning (when considered in isolation from any other sentences) to:
**Example 10.85. **
mi | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | go-to | the | market.  
.i | le | nanmu | pupu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| The | man | [past-past] | bites | the | dog.  
  

The point has not been discussed so far, but it is perfectly grammatical to have more than one tense construct in a sentence:
**Example 10.86. **
puku | mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[past] | I | [future] | go-to | the | market.  
Earlier, I was going to go to the market.  
---  
  

Here there are two tenses in the same bridi, the first floating free and specified by _puku_ , the second in the usual place and specified by __ba__. They are considered cumulative in the same way as the two tenses in separate sentences of Example 10.85. Example 10.86 is therefore equivalent in meaning, except for emphasis, to:
**Example 10.87. **
mi | puba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past-future] | go-to | the | market.  
I was going to go to the market.  
---  
  

Compare Example 10.88 and Example 10.89, which have a different meaning from Example 10.86 and Example 10.87:
**Example 10.88. **
mi | ba | klama | le | zarci | puku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | go-to | the | market | [past].  
I will have gone to the market earlier.  
---  
  

**Example 10.89. **
mi | bapu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future-past] | go-to | the | market.  
I will have gone to the market.  
---  
  

So when multiple tense constructs in a single bridi are involved, order counts – the tenses cannot be shifted around as freely as if there were only one tense to worry about.
But why bother to allow multiple tense constructs at all? They specify separate portions of the imaginary journey, and can be useful in order to make part of a tense sticky. Consider Example 10.90, which adds a second bridi and a __ki__ to Example 10.86:
**Example 10.90. **
pu | ki | ku | mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[past] | [sticky] |  | I | [future] | go-to | the | market.  
.i | le | nanmu | cu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| The | man |  | bites | the | dog.  
  

What is the implied tense of the second sentence? Not __puba__ , but only __pu__ , since only __pu__ was made sticky with __ki__. So the translation is:
> I was going to go to the market. The man bit the dog.
Lojban has several ways of embedding a bridi within another bridi: descriptions, abstractors, relative clauses. (Technically, descriptions contain selbri rather than bridi.) Any of the selbri of these subordinate bridi may have tenses attached. These tenses are interpreted relative to the tense of the main bridi:
**Example 10.91. **
mi | pu | klama | le | ba'o | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | go-to | the | [perfective] | market  
I went to the former market.  
---  
  

The significance of the __ba'o__ in Example 10.91 is that the speaker's destination is described as being “in the aftermath of being a market”; that is, it is a market no longer. In particular, the time at which it was no longer a market is in the speaker's past, because the __ba'o__ is interpreted relative to the __pu__ tense of the main bridi.
Here is an example involving an abstraction bridi:
**Example 10.92. **
mi | ca | jinvi | le | du'u | mi | ba | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | now | opine | the | fact-that | I | will-be | dead.  
I now believe that I will be dead.  
---  
  

Here the event of being dead is said to be in the future with respect to the opinion, which is in the present.
__ki__ may also be used as a tense by itself. This cancels all stickiness and returns the bridi and all following bridi to the speaker's location in both space and time.
In complex descriptions, multiple tenses may be saved and then used by adding a subscript to __ki__. A time made sticky with _kixipa_ (ki-sub-1) can be returned to by specifying _kixipa_ as a tense by itself. In the case of written expression, the writer's here-and-now is often different from the reader's, and a pair of subscripted __ki__ tenses could be used to distinguish the two.

Now we proceed from the attitudinal indicators and their relatives to the other, semantically unrelated, categories of indicators. The indicators known as “evidentials” show how the speaker came to say the utterance; i.e. the source of the information or the idea. Lojban's list of evidentials was derived from lists describing several American Indian languages. Evidentials are also essential to the constructed language Láadan, designed by the linguist and novelist Suzette Haden Elgin. Láadan's set of indicators was drawn on extensively in developing the Lojban indicator system.
It is important to realize, however, that evidentials are not some odd system used by some strange people who live at the other end of nowhere: although their English equivalents aren't single words, English-speakers have vivid notions of what constitutes evidence, and of the different kinds of evidence.
Like the attitudinal indicators, the evidentials belong to selma'o UI, and may be treated identically for grammatical purposes. Most of them are not usually considered scalar in nature, but a few have associated scales.
A bridi with an evidential in it becomes “indisputable”, in the sense that the speaker is saying “how it is with him or her”, which is beyond argument. Claims about one's own mental states may be true or false, but are hardly subject to other people's examination. If you say that you think, or perceive, or postulate such-and-such a predication, who can contradict you? Discourse that uses evidentials has therefore a different rhetorical flavor than discourse that does not; arguments tend to become what can be called dialogues or alternating monologues, depending on your prejudices.
Evidentials are most often placed at the beginning of sentences, and are often attached to the __i__ that separates sentences in connected discourse. It is in the nature of an evidential to affect the entire bridi in which it is placed: like the propositional attitude indicators, they strongly affect the claim made by the main bridi.
A bridi marked by __ja'o__ is a conclusion by the speaker based on other (stated or unstated) information or ideas. Rough English equivalents of __ja'o__ are “thus” and “therefore”.
A bridi marked by __ca'e__ is true because the speaker says so. In addition to definitions of words, __ca'e__ is also appropriate in what are called performatives, where the very act of speaking the words makes them true. An English example is “I now pronounce you husband and wife”, where the very act of uttering the words makes the listeners into husband and wife. A Lojban translation might be:
**Example 13.77. **
ca'e | le | re | do | cu | simxu | speni  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[I-define!] | the | two | of-you |  | are-mutual | spouses.  
  

The three scale positions of __ba'a__ , when attached to a bridi, indicate that it is based on the speaker's view of the real world. Thus __ba'a__ means that the statement represents a future event as anticipated by the speaker; __ba'acu'i__ , a present event as experienced by the speaker; __ba'anai__ , a past event as remembered by the speaker. It is accidental that this scale runs from future to past instead of past to future.
**Example 13.78. **
ba'acu'i | le | tuple | be | mi | cu | se cortu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[I-experience!] | the | leg | of | me |  | is-the-locus-of-pain.  
My leg hurts.  
---  
  

A bridi marked by __su'a__ is a generalization by the speaker based on other (stated or unstated) information or ideas. The difference between __su'a__ and __ja'o__ is that __ja'o__ suggests some sort of reasoning or deduction (not necessarily rigorous), whereas __su'a__ suggests some sort of induction or pattern recognition from existing examples (not necessarily rigorous).
The opposite point of the scale, __su'anai__ , indicates abduction, or drawing specific conclusions from general premises or patterns.
This cmavo can also function as a discursive (see Section 13.12), in which case __su'a__ means “abstractly” or “in general”, and __su'anai__ means “concretely” or “in particular”.
A bridi marked by __ti'e__ is relayed information from some source other than the speaker. There is no necessary implication that the information was relayed via the speaker's ears; what we read in a newspaper is an equally good example of __ti'e__ , unless we have personal knowledge of the content.
**Example 13.79. **
ti'e | la | .uengas | cu | zergau  
---|---|---|---|---  
[I-hear!] | Wenga |  | is-a-criminal-doer.  
I hear that Wenga is a crook.  
---  
  

A bridi marked by __ka'u__ is one held to be true in the speaker's cultural context, as a matter of myth or custom, for example. Such statements should be agreed on by a community of people – you cannot just make up your own cultural context – although “objectivity” in the sense of actual correspondence with the facts is certainly not required.
On the other hand, __se'o__ marks a bridi whose truth is asserted by the speaker as a result of an internal experience not directly available to others, such as a dream, vision, or personal revelation. In some cultures, the line between __ka'u__ and __se'o__ is fuzzy or even nonexistent.
A bridi marked by __za'a__ is based on perception or direct observation by the speaker. This use of “observe” is not connected with the Lojban “observative”, or bridi with the first sumti omitted. The latter has no explicit aspect, and could be a direct observation, a conclusion, an opinion, or other aspectual point of view.
**Example 13.80. **
za'a | do | tatpi  
---|---|---  
[I-observe!] | you | are-tired.  
I see you are tired.  
---  
  

A bridi marked by __pe'i__ is the opinion of the speaker. The form _pe'ipei_ is common, meaning “Is this your opinion?”. (Strictly, this should be _peipe'i_ , in accordance with the distinction explained in Example 13.69 through Example 13.71, but since __pe'i__ is not really a scale, there is no real difference between the two orders.)
**Example 13.81. **
pe'i | la | kartagos. | .ei | se daspo  
---|---|---|---|---  
[I-opine!] | that-named | Carthage | [obligation] | is-destroyed.  
In my opinion, Carthage should be destroyed.  
---  
  

A bridi marked by __ru'a__ is an assumption made by the speaker. This is similar to one possible use of __e'u__.
**Example 13.82. **
ru'a | doi | livinston.  
---|---|---  
[I-presume] | o | Livingstone.  
Dr. Livingstone, I presume? (A rhetorical question: Stanley knew who he was.)  
---  
  

Finally, the evidential __ju'a__ is used to avoid stating a specific basis for a statement. It can also be used when the basis for the speaker's statement is not covered by any other evidential. For the most part, using __ju'a__ is equivalent to using no evidential at all, but in question form it can be useful: _ju'apei_ means “What is the basis for your statement?” and serves as an evidential, as distinct from emotional, question.

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  
I'm worn out by your continuous talking.  
---  
  

**Example 13.27. **
.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  
I'm putting you to bed.  
---  
  

**Example 13.28. **
.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.  
---  
  

**Example 13.29. **
.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  
I hope I feel better tomorrow!  
---  
  

**Example 13.30. **
.au | mi | sipna  
---|---|---  
[desire] | I | sleep.  
I want to sleep.  
---  
  

**Example 13.31. **
.a'ucu'i | do | pante  
---|---|---  
[no-interest] | you | complain.  
I have no interest in your complaints.  
---  
  

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  
I feel up to dealing with you.  
---  
  

**Example 13.34. **
.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  
I should fill the car's gas tank.  
---  
  

**Example 13.35. **
.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  
---|---|---|---  
[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  
Please take care of yourself!  
---  
  

**Example 13.36. **
.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  
I suggest going to the park.  
---  
  

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  
I can't believe you thought you could fool me.  
---  
  

**Example 13.38. **
do | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  
I blame you for not coming home.  
---  
  

**Example 13.39. **
.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  
le | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  
It's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  
---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  
---

## 16.8. The problem of “any”
Consider the English sentence 
**Example 16.47. **
Anyone who goes to the store, walks across the field.
  

Using the facilities already discussed, a plausible translation might be
**Example 16.48. **
ro | da | poi | klama | le | zarci | cu | cadzu | le | foldi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | X | such-that-it | goes-to | the | store |  | walks-on | the | field.  
Everyone who goes to the store walks across the field.  
---  
  

But there is a subtle difference between Example 16.47 and Example 16.48. Example 16.48 tells us that, in fact, there are people who go to the store, and that they walk across the field. A sumti of the type _ro da poi klama_ requires that there are things which __klama__ : Lojban universal claims always imply the corresponding existential claims as well. Example 16.47, on the other hand, does not require that there are any people who go to the store: it simply states, conditionally, that if there is anyone who goes to the store, he or she walks across the field as well. This conditional form mirrors the true Lojban translation of Example 16.47:
**Example 16.49. **
ro | da | zo'u | da | go | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X | : | X | if-and-only-if | it-is-a-goer-to | the | store  
gi | cadzu | le | foldi  
---|---|---|---  
| is-a-walker-on | the | field.  
  

Although Example 16.49 is a universal claim as well, its universality only implies that there are objects of some sort or another in the universe of discourse. Because the claim is conditional, nothing is implied about the existence of goers-to-the-store or of walkers-on-the-field, merely that any entity which is one is also the other.
There is another use of “any” in English that is not universal but existential. Consider
**Example 16.50. **
I need any box that is bigger than this one.
  

Example 16.50 does not at all mean that I need every box bigger than this one, for indeed I do not; I require only one box. But the naive translation
**Example 16.51. **
mi | nitcu | da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | some-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-one  
  

does not work either, because it asserts that there really is such a box, as the prenex paraphrase demonstrates:
**Example 16.52. **
da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti | zo'u | mi | nitcu | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this | : | I | need | X.  
  

What to do? Well, the x2 place of __nitcu__ can be filled with an event as well as an object, and in fact Example 16.51 can also be paraphrased as:
**Example 16.53. **
mi | nitcu | lo | nu | mi | ponse | lo | tanxe  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | an | event-of | I | possess | some | box(es)  
poi | bramau | ti  
---|---|---  
which-are | bigger-than | this-one.  
  

Rewritten using variables, Example 16.53 becomes
**Example 16.54. **
mi | nitcu | lo | nu | da | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | an | event-of | there-being-an-X | such-that:  
da | se | ponse | mi  
---|---|---|---  
X |  | is-possessed-by | me  
gi'e | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-thing.  
  

So we see that a prenex can be attached to a bridi that is within a sentence. By default, a variable always behaves as if it is bound in the prenex which (notionally) is attached to the smallest enclosing bridi, and its scope does not extend beyond that bridi. However, the variable may be placed in an outer prenex explicitly:
**Example 16.55. **
da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-one | such-that:  
mi | nitcu | le | nu | mi | ponse | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | the | event-of | my | possessing | X.  
  

But what are the implications of Example 16.53 and Example 16.55? The main difference is that in Example 16.55, the __da__ is said to exist in the real world of the outer bridi; but in Example 16.53, the existence is only within the inner bridi, which is a mere event that need not necessarily come to pass. So Example 16.55 means
**Example 16.56. **
There's a box, bigger than this one, that I need
  

which is what Example 16.52 says, whereas Example 16.53 turns out to be an effective translation of our original Example 16.47. So uses of “any” that aren't universal end up being reflected by variables bound in the prenex of a subordinate bridi.

The mi-series of pro-sumti refer to the speaker, the listener, and others in various combinations. __mi__ refers to the speaker and perhaps others for whom the speaker speaks; it may be a Lojbanic mass. __do__ refers to the listener or listeners. Neither __mi__ nor __do__ is specific about the number of persons referred to; for example, the foreman of a jury may refer to the members of the jury as __mi__ , since in speaking officially he represents all of them.
The referents of __mi__ and __do__ are usually obvious from the context, but may be assigned by the vocative words of selma'o COI, explained in Section 13.14. The vocative __mi'e__ assigns __mi__ , whereas all of the other vocatives assign __do__.
**Example 7.5. **
mi'e | .djan. | doi | frank. | mi | cusku | lu | mi | bajra | li'u |  | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I-am | John, | O | Frank, | I | express | [quote] | I | run | [unquote] | to | you  
I am John, Frank; I tell you “I run”.  
---  
  

The cmavo __mi'o__ , __mi'a__ , __ma'a__ , and __do'o__ express various combinations of the speaker and/or the listener and/or other people:
  * __mi'o__ includes only the speaker and the listener but no one else;
  * __mi'a__ includes the speaker and others but excludes the listener;
  * __do'o__ includes the listener and others but excludes the speaker;
  * __ma'a__ includes all three: speaker, listener, others.


All of these pro-sumti represent masses. For example, __mi'o__ is the same as _mi joi do_ , the mass of me and you considered jointly.
In English, “we” can mean __mi__ or __mi'o__ or __mi'a__ or even __ma'a__ , and English-speakers often suffer because they cannot easily distinguish __mi'o__ from __mi'a__ :
**Example 7.6. **
We're going to the store.
  

Does this include the listener or not? There's no way to be sure.
Finally, the cmavo __ko__ is logically equivalent to __do__ ; its referent is the listener. However, its use alters an assertion about the listener into a command to the listener to make the assertion true:
**Example 7.7. **
do | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
You | go-to | the | store.  
  

becomes:
**Example 7.8. **
ko | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
You [imperative] | go-to | the | store.  
Make “you go to the store” true!  
---  
Go to the store!  
  

In English, the subject of a command is omitted, but in Lojban, the word __ko__ must be used. However, __ko__ does not have to appear in the x1 place:
**Example 7.9. **
mi | viska | ko  
---|---|---  
I | see | you-[imperative]  
Make “I see you” true!  
---  
Be seen by me!  
  

In Example 7.9, it is necessary to make the verb passive in English in order to convey the effect of __ko__ in the x2 place. Indeed, __ko__ does not even have to be a sumti of the main bridi:
**Example 7.10. **
mi | viska | le | prenu | poi | prami | ko  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | person | that | loves | you-[imperative]  
Make “I see the person that loves you” true!  
---  
Be such that the person who loves you is seen by me!  
Show me the person who loves you!  
  

As mentioned in Section 7.1, some pro-sumti series have corresponding pro-bridi series. However, there is no equivalent of the mi-series among pro-bridi, since a person isn't a relationship.
