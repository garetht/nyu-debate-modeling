## 6.8. Indefinite descriptions
By a quirk of Lojban syntax, it is possible to omit the descriptor __lo__ , but never any other descriptor, from a description like that of Example 6.42; namely, one which has an explicit outer quantifier but no explicit inner quantifier. The following example:
**Example 6.44. **
ci | gerku | [ku] | cu | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---  
Three-of-those-which-are | dogs |  |  | are-white.  
Three dogs are white.  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 6.42. Even though the descriptor is not present, the elidable terminator __ku__ may still be used. The name “indefinite description” for this syntactic form is historically based: of course, it is no more and no less indefinite than its counterpart with an explicit __lo__. Indefinite descriptions were introduced into the language in order to imitate the syntax of English and other natural languages.
Indefinite descriptions must fit this mold exactly: there is no way to make one which does not have an explicit outer quantifier (thus _*gerku cu blabi_ is ungrammatical), or which has an explicit inner quantifier (thus _*reboi ci gerku cu blabi_ is also ungrammatical – _re ci gerku cu blabi_ is fine, but means “23 dogs are white”).
Note: Example 6.32 also contains an indefinite description, namely _su'o ci cutci_ ; another version of that example using an explicit __lo__ would be:
**Example 6.45. **
mi | ponse | su'o | ci | lo | cutci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | at-least | three | things-which-really-are | shoes  
I own three (or more) shoes.

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 9.7. Modal sentence connection: the causals
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ri'a |  BAI |  rinka modal: physical cause  
---|---|---  
ki'u |  BAI |  krinu modal: justification  
mu'i |  BAI |  mukti modal: motivation  
ni'i |  BAI |  nibli modal: logical entailment  
This section has two purposes. On the one hand, it explains the grammatical construct called “modal sentence connection”. On the other, it exemplifies some of the more useful BAI cmavo: the causals. (There are other BAI cmavo which have causal implications: __ja'e__ means “with result”, and so __seja'e__ means “with cause of unspecified nature”; likewise, __gau__ means “with agent” and __tezu'e__ means “with purpose”. These other modal cmavo will not be further discussed here, as my purpose is to explain modal sentence connection rather than Lojbanic views of causation.)
There are four causal gismu in Lojban, distinguishing different versions of the relationships lumped in English as “causal”:
_ _rinka_ _ |  event x1 physically causes event x2  
---|---  
_ _krinu_ _ |  event x1 is the justification for event x2  
_ _mukti_ _ |  event x1 is the (human) motive for event x2  
_ _nibli_ _ |  event x1 logically entails event x2  
Each of these gismu has a related modal: __ri'a__ , __ki'u__ , __mu'i__ , and __ni'i__ respectively. Using these gismu and these modals, we can create various causal sentences with different implications:
**Example 9.35. **
le | spati | cu | banro | ri'a | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | plant |  | grows | with-physical-cause | the | event-of  
do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
you | water | give | to | the | plant.  
The plant grows because you water it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.36. **
la | djan. | cpacu | le | pamoi | se jinga  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John | gets | the | first | prize  
ki'u | le | nu | la | djan. | jinga  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
with-justification | the | event-of | that-named | John | wins.  
John got the first prize because he won.  
---  
  

**Example 9.37. **
mi | lebna | le | cukta | mu'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | took | the | book | with-motivation  
le | nu | mi | viska | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | I | saw | the | book.  
I took the book because I saw it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.38. **
la | sokrates. | morsi | binxo | ni'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
| Socrates | dead | became | with-logical-justification  
le | nu | la | sokrates. | remna  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | that-named | Socrates | is-human.  
Socrates died because Socrates is human.  
---  
  

In Example 9.35 through Example 9.38, the same English word “because” is used to translate all four modals, but the types of cause being expressed are quite different. Let us now focus on Example 9.35, and explore some variations on it.
As written, Example 9.35 claims that the plant grows, but only refers to the event of watering it in an abstraction bridi (abstractions are explained in Chapter 11) without actually making a claim. If I express Example 9.35, I have said that the plant in fact grows, but I have not said that you actually water it, merely that there is a causal relationship between watering and growing. This is semantically asymmetrical. Suppose I wanted to claim that the plant was being watered, and only mention its growth as ancillary information? Then we could reverse the main bridi and the abstraction bridi, saying:
**Example 9.39. **
do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | water | give | to | the | plant  
seri'a | le | nu | ri | banro  
---|---|---|---|---  
with-physical-effect | the | event-of | it | grows.  
You water the plant; therefore, it grows.  
---  
  

with the __ri'a__ changed to __seri'a__. In addition, there are also symmetrical forms:
**Example 9.40. **
le | nu | do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati | cu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | (you | water | give | to | the | plant) |   
rinka | le | nu | le | spati | cu | banro  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
causes | the | event-of | (the | plant |  | grows).  
Your watering the plant causes its growth.  
---  
If you water the plant, then it grows.  
  

does not claim either event, but asserts only the causal relationship between them. So in Example 9.40, I am not saying that the plant grows nor that you have in fact watered it. The second colloquial translation shows a form of “if-then” in English quite distinct from the logical connective “if-then” explained in Chapter 14.
Suppose we wish to claim both events as well as their causal relationship? We can use one of two methods:
**Example 9.41. **
le | spati | cu | banro | .iri'abo | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | plant |  | grows. | Because | you  
djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---  
water | give | to | the | plant.  
The plant grows because you water it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.42. **
do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | water | give | to | the | plant.  
.iseri'abo | le | spati | cu | banro  
---|---|---|---|---  
Therefore | the | plant |  | grows.  
You water the plant; therefore, it grows.  
---  
  

The compound cmavo _.iri'abo_ and _.iseri'abo_ serve to connect two bridi, as the initial __i__ indicates. The final __bo__ is necessary to prevent the modal from “taking over” the following sumti. If the __bo__ were omitted from Example 9.41 we would have:
**Example 9.43. **
le | spati | cu | banro | .i | ri'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | plant |  | grows. |  | Because-of | you,  
| djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[something] | water | gives | to | the | plant.  
The plant grows. Because of you, water is given to the plant.  
---  
  

Because _ri'a do_ is a modal sumti in Example 9.43, there is no longer an explicit sumti in the x1 place of _djacu dunda_ , and the translation must be changed.
The effect of sentences like Example 9.41 and Example 9.42 is that the modal, __ri'a__ in this example, no longer modifies an explicit sumti. Instead, the sumti is implicit, the event given by a full bridi. Furthermore, there is a second implication: that the first bridi fills the x2 place of the gismu __rinka__ ; it specifies an event which is the effect. I am therefore claiming three things: that the plant grows, that you have watered it, and that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the two.
In principle, any modal tag can appear in a sentence connective of the type exemplified by Example 9.41 and Example 9.42. However, it makes little sense to use any modals which do not expect events or other abstractions to fill the places of the corresponding gismu. The sentence connective _.ibaubo_ is perfectly grammatical, but it is hard to imagine any two sentences which could be connected by an “in-language” modal. This is because a sentence describes an event, and an event can be a cause or an effect, but not a language.

## 14.7. More than two propositions
So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.
Of the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,
**Example 14.31. **
mi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,
**Example 14.32. **
mi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that one or more of the component sentences is true.
O, however, is different. Working out the truth table for
**Example 14.33. **
mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  
  

shows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:
> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.
Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.
In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.
There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: 
**Example 14.34. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  
.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

Does this mean:
**Example 14.35. **
I like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.
  

Or is the correct translation:
**Example 14.36. **
Either I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.
  

Example 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:
**Example 14.37. **
ga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | I | like | that-named | Martha)  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas
**Example 14.38. **
ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary).  
  

is not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.

## 14.8. Grouping of afterthought connectives
There are several ways in Lojban to render Example 14.35 using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo __bo__ (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with __bo__ are interpreted before connections not so marked. Example 14.39 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.38:
**Example 14.39. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John, | and | I | like | that-named | Martha  
.ijabo | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by __.i__ __ja__ first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by __.i__ __je__.
Eks can have __bo__ attached in exactly the same way, so that Example 14.40 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39:
**Example 14.40. **
mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with __bo__ , for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.
What happens if __bo__ is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in Example 14.41?
**Example 14.41. **
mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Does this wind up meaning the same as Example 14.34 and Example 14.36? Not at all. A second rule relating to __bo__ is that where several __bo__ -marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, Example 14.41 in fact means the same as Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with __bo__ should be avoided.
The use of __bo__ , therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of Example 14.37 and Example 14.38, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ are used with ijeks, and __ke__ and __ke'e__ with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (__ke__ and __ke'e__ are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.42. **
I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
  

where the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express Example 14.42 in afterthought, we can say:
**Example 14.43. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije[bo] | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me,  
.ijanai | mi | prami | do | .ijebo | do | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | I | love | you | and | you | love | me.  
  

marking two of the ijeks with __bo__ for high precedence. (The first __bo__ is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)
But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:
**Example 14.44. **
tu'e | mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me | )  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

where the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ pairs set off the structure. The cmavo __tu'u__ is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in Example 14.44 is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.
In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to __bo__ grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.
Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:
**Example 14.45. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider
**Example 14.46. **
I walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.
  

Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to Example 14.44, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with __ke__ , so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing Example 14.47, which is instead parallel to Example 14.45:
**Example 14.47. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | the | house  
.a | ke | le | ckule | .e | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | the | school | and | the | office | ).  
  

If sumti were allowed to begin with __ke__ , unavoidable ambiguities would result, so __ke__ grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to __tu'e__ grouping of bridi, as Example 14.44 shows.
Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of Example 14.33: “I am German, rich, and a man – or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:
**Example 14.48. **
[tu'e] | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-rich | )  
.ije | tu'e | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | nanmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | ( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-a-man | ).  
  

The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.

## 16.9. Negation boundaries
This section, as well as Section 16.10 through Section 16.12, are in effect a continuation of Chapter 15, introducing features of Lojban negation that require an understanding of prenexes and variables. In the examples below, “there is a Y” and the like must be understood as “there is at least one Y, possibly more”.
As explained in Section 15.2, the negation of a bridi is usually accomplished by inserting __na__ at the beginning of the selbri:
**Example 16.57. **
mi | na | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [false] | go-to | the | store.  
It is false that I go to the store.  
---  
I don't go to the store.  
  

The other form of bridi negation is expressed by using the compound cmavo _naku_ in the prenex, which is identified and compounded by the lexer before looking at the sentence grammar. In Lojban grammar, _naku_ is then treated like a sumti. In a prenex, _naku_ means precisely the same thing as the logician's “it is not the case that” in a similar English context. (Outside of a prenex, _naku_ is also grammatically treated as a single entity – the equivalent of a sumti – but does not have this exact meaning; we'll discuss these other situations in Section 16.11.)
To represent a bridi negation using a prenex, remove the __na__ from before the selbri and place _naku_ at the left end of the prenex. This form is called “external bridi negation”, as opposed to “internal bridi negation” using __na__. The prenex version of Example 16.57 is
**Example 16.58. **
naku | zo'u | la | djan. | klama  
---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-not-the-case-that | : | that-named | John | comes.  
It is false that: John comes.  
---  
  

However, _naku_ can appear at other points in the prenex as well. Compare
**Example 16.59. **
naku | de | zo'u | de | zutse  
---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-not-the-case-that: | for-some-Y | : | Y | sits.  
It-is-false-that: | for-at-least-one-Y | : | Y | sits.  
It is false that something sits.  
---  
Nothing sits.  
  

with
**Example 16.60. **
su'ode | naku | zo'u | de | zutse  
---|---|---|---|---  
For-at-least-one-Y, | it-is-false-that | : | Y | sits.  
There is something that doesn't sit.  
---  
  

The relative position of negation and quantification terms within a prenex has a drastic effect on meaning. Starting without a negation, we can have:
**Example 16.61. **
roda | su'ode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every-X, | there-is-a-Y, | such-that | X | loves | Y.  
Everybody loves at least one thing (each, not necessarily the same thing).  
---  
  

or:
**Example 16.62. **
su'ode | roda | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-a-Y, | such-that-for-each-X | : | X | loves | Y.  
There is at least one particular thing that is loved by everybody.  
---  
  

The simplest form of bridi negation to interpret is one where the negation term is at the beginning of the prenex:
**Example 16.63. **
naku | roda | su'ode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-false-that: | for-every-X, | there-is-a-Y, | such-that: | X | loves | Y.  
It is false that: everybody loves at least one thing.  
---  
(At least) someone doesn't love anything.  
  

the negation of Example 16.61, and
**Example 16.64. **
naku | su'ode | roda | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-false-that: | there-is-a-Y | such-that | for-each-X | : | X | loves | Y.  
It is false that: there is at least one thing that is loved by everybody.  
---  
There isn't any one thing that everybody loves.  
  

the negation of Example 16.62.
The rules of formal logic require that, to move a negation boundary within a prenex, you must “invert any quantifier” that the negation boundary passes across. Inverting a quantifier means that any __ro__ (all) is changed to __su'o__ (at least one) and vice versa. Thus, Example 16.63 and Example 16.64 can be restated as, respectively:
**Example 16.65. **
su'oda | naku | su'ode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-some-X, | it-is-false-that: | there-is-a-Y | such-that: | X | loves | Y.  
There is somebody who doesn't love anything.  
---  
  

and:
**Example 16.66. **
rode | naku | roda | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every-Y, | it-is-false-that: | for-every-X | : | X | loves | Y.  
For each thing, it is not true that everybody loves it.  
---  
  

Another movement of the negation boundary produces:
**Example 16.67. **
su'oda | rode | naku | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X | such-that-for-every-Y, | it-is-false-that | : | X | loves | Y.  
There is someone who, for each thing, doesn't love that thing.  
---  
  

and
**Example 16.68. **
rode | su'oda | naku | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every-Y, | there-is-an-X, | such-that-it-is-false-that | : | X | loves | Y.  
For each thing there is someone who doesn't love it.  
---  
  

Investigation will show that, indeed, each transformation preserves the meanings of Example 16.63 and Example 16.64.
The quantifier __no__ (meaning “zero of”) also involves a negation boundary. To transform a bridi containing a variable quantified with __no__ , we must first expand it. Consider
**Example 16.69. **
noda | rode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-no-X, | for-every-Y, | such-that | X | loves | Y.  
Nobody loves everything.  
---  
  

which is negated by:
**Example 16.70. **
naku | noda | rode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-false-that: | there-is-no-X-that, | for-every-Y | : | X | loves | Y.  
It is false that there is nobody who loves everything.  
---  
  

We can simplify Example 16.70 by transforming the prenex. To move the negation phrase within the prenex, we must first expand the __no__ quantifier. Thus “for no x” means the same thing as “it is false for some x”, and the corresponding Lojban __noda__ can be replaced by _naku su'oda_. Making this substitution, we get:
**Example 16.71. **
naku | naku | su'oda  
---|---|---  
It-is-false-that | it-is-false-that | there-is-some-X-such-that  
…rode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---  
for-every-X | : | X | loves | Y  
It is false that it is false that: for an X, for every Y: X loves Y.  
---  
  

Adjacent pairs of negation boundaries in the prenex can be dropped, so this means the same as:
**Example 16.72. **
su'oda | rode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X-such-that, | for-every-Y | : | X | loves | Y.  
At least one person loves everything.  
---  
  

which is clearly the desired contradiction of Example 16.69.
The interactions between quantifiers and negation mean that you cannot eliminate double negatives that are not adjacent. You must first move the negation phrases so that they are adjacent, inverting any quantifiers they cross, and then the double negative can be eliminated.

## 16.3. Universal claims
What happens if we substitute “everything” for “something” in Example 16.7? We get:
**Example 16.15. **
Everything sees me.
  

Of course, this example is false, because there are many things which do not see the speaker. It is not easy to find simple truthful examples of so-called universal claims (those which are about everything), so bear with us for a while. (Indeed, some Lojbanists tend to avoid universal claims even in other languages, since they are so rarely true in Lojban.)
The Lojban translation of Example 16.15 is
**Example 16.16. **
ro | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X | : | X | sees | me.  
  

When the variable cmavo __da__ is preceded by __ro__ , the combination means “For every X” rather than “There is an X”. Superficially, these English formulations look totally unrelated: Section 16.6 will bring them within a common viewpoint. For the moment, accept the use of _ro da_ for “everything” on faith.
Here is a universal claim with two variables:
**Example 16.17. **
ro | da | ro | de | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X, | for-every | Y | : | X | loves | Y.  
Everything loves everything.  
---  
  

Again, X and Y can represent the same thing, so Example 16.17 does not mean “Everything loves everything else.” Furthermore, because the claim is universal, it is about every thing, not merely every person, so we cannot use “everyone” or “everybody” in the translation.
Note that __ro__ appears before both __da__ and __de__. If __ro__ is omitted before either variable, we get a mixed claim, partly existential like those of Section 16.2, partly universal.
**Example 16.18. **
ro | da | de | zo'u | da | viska | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X, | there-is-a-Y | : | X | sees | Y.  
Everything sees something.  
---  
  

**Example 16.19. **
da | ro | de | zo'u | da | viska | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X | such-that-for-every | Y | : | X | sees | Y.  
Something sees everything.  
---  
  

Example 16.18 and Example 16.19 mean completely different things. Example 16.18 says that for everything, there is something which it sees, not necessarily the same thing seen for every seer. Example 16.19, on the other hand, says that there is a particular thing which can see everything that there is (including itself). Both of these are fairly silly, but they are different kinds of silliness.
There are various possible translations of universal claims in English: sometimes we use “anybody/anything” rather than “everybody/everything”. Often it makes no difference which of these is used: when it does make a difference, it is a rather subtle one which is explained in Section 16.8.

## 18.9. Approximation and inexact numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ji'i |  PA |  approximately  
---|---|---  
su'e |  PA |  at most  
su'o |  PA |  at least  
me'i |  PA |  less than  
za'u |  PA |  more than  
The cmavo __ji'i__ (of selma'o PA) is used in several ways to indicate approximate or rounded numbers. If it appears at the beginning of a number, the whole number is approximate:
**Example 18.60. **
ji'i | vo | no  
---|---|---  
approximation | four | zero  
approximately 40  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears in the middle of a number, all the digits following it are approximate:
**Example 18.61. **
vo | no | ji'i | mu | no  
---|---|---|---|---  
four | zero | approximation | five | zero  
roughly 4050 (where the “four thousand” is exact, but the “fifty” is approximate)  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears at the end of a number, it indicates that the number has been rounded. In addition, it can then be followed by a sign cmavo (__ma'u__ or __ni'u__), which indicate truncation towards positive or negative infinity respectively.
**Example 18.62. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation  
2.72 (rounded)  
---  
  

**Example 18.63. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i | ma'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation | positive-sign  
2.72 (rounded up)  
---  
  

**Example 18.64. **
re | pi | ze | pa | ji'i | ni'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | one | approximation | negative-sign  
2.71 (rounded down)  
---  
  

Example 18.62 through Example 18.64 are all approximations to __te'o__ (exponential e). __ji'i__ can also appear by itself, in which case it means “approximately the typical value in this context”.
The four cmavo __su'e__ , __su'o__ , __me'i__ , and __za'u__ , also of selma'o PA, express inexact numbers with upper or lower bounds:
**Example 18.65. **
mi | catlu | su'e | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-most | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.66. **
mi | catlu | su'o | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.67. **
mi | catlu | me'i | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | less-than | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.68. **
mi | catlu | za'u | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | more-than | two | persons  
  

Each of these is a subtly different claim: Example 18.66 is true of two or any greater number, whereas Example 18.68 requires three persons or more. Likewise, Example 18.65 refers to zero, one, or two; Example 18.67 to zero or one. (Of course, when the context allows numbers other than non-negative integers, _me'i re_ can be any number less than 2, and likewise with the other cases.) The exact quantifier, “exactly 2, neither more nor less” is just __re__. Note that _su'ore_ is the exact Lojban equivalent of English plurals.
If no number follows one of these cmavo, __pa__ is understood: therefore,
**Example 18.69. **
mi | catlu | su'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least-[one] | person  
  

is a meaningful claim.
Like the numbers in Section 18.8, all of these cmavo may be preceded by __pi__ to make the corresponding quantifiers for part of a whole. For example, __pisu'o__ means “at least some part of”. The quantifiers __ro__ , __su'o__ , __piro__ , and __pisu'o__ are particularly important in Lojban, as they are implicitly used in the descriptions introduced by the cmavo of selma'o LA and LE, as explained in Section 6.7. Descriptions in general are outside the scope of this chapter.

## 6.6. Quantified sumti
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ro |  PA |  all of/each of  
---|---|---  
su'o |  PA |  at least (one of)  
Quantifiers tell us how many: in the case of quantifiers with sumti, how many things we are talking about. In Lojban, quantifiers are expressed by numbers and mathematical expressions: a large topic discussed in some detail in Chapter 18. For the purposes of this chapter, a simplified treatment will suffice. Our examples will employ either the simple Lojban numbers __pa__ , __re__ , __ci__ , __vo__ , and __mu__ , meaning “one”, “two”, “three”, “four”, “five” respectively, or else one of four special quantifiers, two of which are discussed in this section and listed above. These four quantifiers are important because every Lojban sumti has either one or two of them implicitly present in it – which one or two depends on the particular kind of sumti. There is more explanation of implicit quantifiers later in this section. (The other two quantifiers, __piro__ and __pisu'o__ , are explained in Section 6.7.)
Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit quantifier. The purpose of this quantifier is to specify how many of the things referred to by the sumti are being talked about. Here are some simple examples contrasting sumti with and without explicit quantifiers:
**Example 6.30. **
do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---  
You | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

**Example 6.31. **
re | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
Two-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

The difference between Example 6.30 and Example 6.31 is the presence of the explicit quantifier __re__ in the latter example. Although __re__ by itself means “two”, when used as a quantifier it means “two-of”. Out of the group of listeners (the number of which isn't stated), two (we are not told which ones) are asserted to be “walkers on the ice”. Implicitly, the others (if any) are not walkers on the ice. In Lojban, you cannot say “I own three shoes” if in fact you own four shoes. Numbers need never be specified, but if they are specified they must be correct.
(This rule does not mean that there is no way to specify a number which is vague. The sentence
**Example 6.32. **
mi | ponse | su'o | ci | cutci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | at-least | three | shoes.  
  

is true if you own three shoes, or four, or indeed any larger number. More details on vague numbers appear in the discussion of mathematical expressions in Chapter 18.)
Now consider Example 6.30 again. How many of the listeners are claimed to walk on the ice? The answer turns out to be: all of them, however many that is. So Example 6.30 and Example 6.33:
**Example 6.33. **
ro | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
All-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

turn out to mean exactly the same thing. This is a safe strategy, because if one of my listeners doesn't turn out to be walking on the ice, I can safely claim that I didn't intend that person to be a listener! And in fact, all of the personal pro-sumti such as __mi__ and __mi'o__ and __ko__ obey the same rule. We say that personal pro-sumti have a so-called “implicit quantifier” of __ro__ (all). This just means that if no quantifier is given explicitly, the meaning is the same as if the implicit quantifier had been used.
Not all sumti have __ro__ as the implicit quantifier, however. Consider the quotation in:
**Example 6.34. **
mi | cusku | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say, “You walk on the ice.”  
---  
  

What is the implicit quantifier of the quotation _lu do cadzu le bisli li'u_? Surely not __ro__. If __ro__ were supplied explicitly, thus:
**Example 6.35. **
mi | cusku | ro | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | all-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

the meaning would be something like “I say every occurrence of the sentence 'You walk on the ice'”. Of course I don't say every occurrence of it, only some occurrences. One might suppose that Example 6.34 means that I express exactly one occurrence, but it is more Lojbanic to leave the number unspecified, as with other sumti. We can say definitely, however, that I say it at least once.
The Lojban cmavo meaning “at least” is __su'o__ , and if no ordinary number follows, __su'o__ means “at least once”. (See Example 6.32 for the use of __su'o__ with an ordinary number). Therefore, the explicitly quantified version of Example 6.34 is
**Example 6.36. **
mi | cusku | su'o | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | at-least-one-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say one or more instances of “You walk on the ice”.  
---  
I say “You walk on the ice”.  
  

If an explicit ordinary number such as __re__ were to appear, it would have to convey an exact expression, so
**Example 6.37. **
mi | cusku | re | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | two-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

means that I say the sentence exactly twice, neither more nor less.

## 7.12. Bound variable pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the da-series and the bu'a-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
da |  KOhA |  da-series |  something-1   
---|---|---|---  
de |  KOhA |  da-series |  something-2  
di |  KOhA |  da-series |  something-3

bu'e |  GOhA |  bu'a-series |  some-predicate-2  
bu'i |  GOhA |  bu'a-series |  some-predicate-3  
Bound variables belong to the predicate-logic part of Lojban, and are listed here for completeness only. Their semantics is explained in Chapter 16. It is worth mentioning that the Lojban translation of Example 7.2 is:
**Example 7.73. **
la | djan. | cu | lafti | da | poi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | raised | something-1 | which  
grana | ku'o | gi'e | desygau | da  
---|---|---|---|---  
is-a-stick |  | and | shake-did | something-1.  
John picked up a stick and shook it.

## 16.6. Variables with generalized quantifiers
So far, we have seen variables with either nothing in front, or with the cmavo __ro__ in front. Now __ro__ is a Lojban number, and means “all”; thus _ro prenu_ means “all persons”, just as _re prenu_ means “two persons”. In fact, unadorned __da__ is also taken to have an implicit number in front of it, namely __su'o__ , which means “at least one”. Why is this? Consider Example 16.9 again, this time with an explicit __su'o__ :
**Example 16.33. **
su'o | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-at-least-one | X | : | X | sees | me.  
Something sees me.  
---  
  

From this version of Example 16.9, we understand the speaker's claim to be that of all the things that there are, at least one of them sees him or her. The corresponding universal claim, Example 16.16, says that of all the things that exist, every one of them can see the speaker.
Any other number can be used instead of __ro__ or __su'o__ to precede a variable. Then we get claims like:
**Example 16.34. **
re | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-two | Xes | : | X | sees | me.  
Two things see me.  
---  
  

This means that exactly two things, no more or less, saw the speaker on the relevant occasion. In English, we might take “Two things see me” to mean that at least two things see the speaker, but there might be more; in Lojban, though, that claim would have to be made as:
**Example 16.35. **
su'ore | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-at-least-two | Xes | : | X | sees | me.  
  

which would be false if nothing, or only one thing, saw the speaker, but not otherwise. We note the __su'o__ here meaning “at least”; __su'o__ by itself is short for _su'opa_ where __pa__ means “one”, as is explained in Section 18.9.
The prenex may be removed from Example 16.34 and Example 16.35 as from the others, leading to:
**Example 16.36. **
re | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---  
Two | Xes | see | me.  
  

and
**Example 16.37. **
su'ore | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---  
At-least-two | Xes | see | me.  
  

respectively, subject to the rules prescribed in Section 16.5.
Now we can explain the constructions _ro prenu_ for “all persons” and _re prenu_ for “two persons” which were casually mentioned at the beginning of this Section. In fact, _ro prenu_ , a so-called “indefinite description”, is shorthand for _ro DA poi prenu_ , where “DA” represents a fictitious variable that hasn't been used yet and will not be used in future. (Even if all three of __da__ , __de__ , and __di__ have been used up, it does not matter, for there are ways of getting more variables, discussed in Section 16.14.) So in fact
**Example 16.38. **
re | prenu | cu | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
Two | persons |  | see | me.  
  

is short for
**Example 16.39. **
re | da | poi | prenu | cu | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | Xes | which | are-persons |  | see | me.  
  

which in turn is short for:
**Example 16.40. **
re | da | poi | prenu | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-two | Xes | which | are-persons | : | X | sees | me.  
  

Note that when we move more than one variable to the prenex (along with its attached relative clause), we must make sure that the variables are in the same order in the prenex as in the bridi proper.

## 10.4. Temporal tenses: PU and ZI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
pu |  PU |  past  
---|---|---  
ca |  PU |  present  
ba |  PU |  future  
zi |  ZI |  short time distance  
za |  ZI |  medium time distance  
zu |  ZI |  long time distance  
Now that the reader understands spatial tenses, there are only two main facts to understand about temporal tenses: they work exactly like the spatial tenses, with selma'o PU and ZI standing in for FAhA and VA; and when both spatial and temporal tense cmavo are given in a single tense construct, the temporal tense is expressed first. (If space could be expressed before or after time at will, then certain constructions would be ambiguous.)
**Example 10.15. **
le | nanmu | pu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [past] | bites | the | dog.  
The man bit the dog.  
---  
  

means that to reach the dog-biting, you must take an imaginary journey through time, moving towards the past an unspecified distance. (Of course, this journey is even more imaginary than the ones talked about in the previous sections, since time-travel is not an available option.)
Lojban recognizes three temporal directions: __pu__ for the past, __ca__ for the present, and __ba__ for the future. (Etymologically, these derive from the corresponding gismu __purci__ , __cabna__ , and __balvi__. See Section 10.23 for an explanation of the exact relationship between the cmavo and the gismu.) There are many more spatial directions, since there are FAhA cmavo for both absolute and relative directions as well as “direction-like relationships” like “surrounding”, “within”, “touching”, etc. (See Section 10.27 for a complete list.) But there are really only two directions in time: forward and backward, toward the future and toward the past. Why, then, are there three cmavo of selma'o PU?
The reason is that tense is subjective: human beings perceive space and time in a way that does not necessarily agree with objective measurements. We have a sense of “now” which includes part of the objective past and part of the objective future, and so we naturally segment the time line into three parts. The Lojban design recognizes this human reality by providing a separate time-direction cmavo for the “zero direction”, Similarly, there is a FAhA cmavo for the zero space direction: __bu'u__ , which means something like “coinciding”.
(Technical note for readers conversant with relativity theory: The Lojban time tenses reflect time as seen by the speaker, who is assumed to be a “point-like observer” in the relativistic sense: they do not say anything about physical relationships of relativistic interval, still less about implicit causality. The nature of tense is not only subjective but also observer-based.)
Here are some examples of temporal tenses:
**Example 10.16. **
le | nanmu | puzi | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [past-short-distance] | bites | the | dog.  
A short time ago, the man bit the dog.  
---  
  

**Example 10.17. **
le | nanmu | pu | pu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [past] | [past] | bites | the | dog.  
Earlier than an earlier time than now, the man bit the dog.  
---  
The man had bitten the dog.  
The man had been biting the dog.  
  

**Example 10.18. **
le | nanmu | ba | puzi | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [future] | [past-short] | bites | the | dog.  
Shortly earlier than some time later than now, the man will bite the dog.  
---  
Soon before then, the man will have bitten the dog.  
The man will have just bitten the dog.  
The man will just have been biting the dog.  
  

What about the analogue of an initial VA without a direction? Lojban does allow an initial ZI with or without following PUs:
**Example 10.19. **
le | nanmu | zi | pu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [short] | [past] | bites | the | dog.  
Before a short time from or before now, the man bit or will bite the dog.  
---  
  

**Example 10.20. **
le | nanmu | zu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [long] | bites | the | dog.  
A long time from or before now, the man will bite or bit the dog.  
---  
  

Example 10.19 and Example 10.20 are perfectly legitimate, but may not be very much used: __zi__ by itself signals an event that happens at a time close to the present, but without saying whether it is in the past or the future. A rough translation might be “about now, but not exactly now”.
Because we can move in any direction in space, we are comfortable with the idea of events happening in an unspecified space direction (“nearby” or “far away”), but we live only from past to future, and the idea of an event which happens “nearby in time” is a peculiar one. Lojban provides lots of such possibilities that don't seem all that useful to English-speakers, even though you can put them together productively; this fact may be a limitation of English.
Finally, here are examples which combine temporal and spatial tense:
**Example 10.21. **
le | nanmu | puzu | vu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [past-long-time] | [long-space] | bites | the | dog.  
Long ago and far away, the man bit the dog.  
---  
  

Alternatively,
**Example 10.22. **
le | nanmu | cu | batci | le | gerku | puzuvuku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man |  | bites | the | dog | [past-long-time-long-space].  
The man bit the dog long ago and far away.  
---

## 14.18. Tenses, modals, and logical connection
The tense and modal systems of Lojban interact with the logical connective system. No one chapter can explain all of these simultaneously, so each chapter must present its own view of the area of interaction with emphasis on its own concepts and terminology. In the examples of this chapter, the many tenses of various selma'o as well as the modals of selma'o BAI are represented by the simple time cmavo __pu__ , __ca__ , and __ba__ (of selma'o PU) representing the past, the present, and the future respectively. Preceding a selbri, these cmavo state the time when the bridi was, is, or will be true (analogous to English verb tenses); preceding a sumti, they state that the event of the main bridi is before, simultaneous with, or after the event given by the sumti (which is generally a _le nu_ abstraction; see Section 11.2).
The two types of interaction between tenses and logical connectives are logically connected tenses and tensed logical connections. The former are fairly simple. Jeks may be used between tense cmavo to specify two connected bridi that differ only in tense:
**Example 14.155. **
la | .artr. | pu | nolraitru  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | Arthur | [past] | is-a-noblest-governor.  
.ije | la | .artr. | ba | nolraitru  
---|---|---|---|---  
And | that-named | Arthur | [future] | is-a-noblest-governor.  
Arthur was a king, and Arthur will be a king.  
---  
  

can be reduced to:
**Example 14.156. **
la | .artr. | pu | je | ba | nolraitru  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Arthur | [past] | and | [future] | is-a-noblest-governor.  
Arthur was and will be king.  
---  
  

Example 14.155 and Example 14.156 are equivalent in meaning; neither says anything about whether Arthur is king now.
Non-logical connection with joiks is also possible between tenses:
**Example 14.157. **
mi | pu | bi'o | ba | vasxu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | from-...-to | [future] | breathe.  
I breathe from a past time until a future time.  
---  
  

The full tense system makes more interesting tense intervals expressible, such as “from a medium time ago until a long time from now”.
No forethought connections between tenses are permitted by the grammar, nor is there any way to override the default left-grouping rule; these limitations are imposed to keep the tense grammar simpler. Whatever can be said with tenses or modals can be said with subordinate bridi stating the time, place, or mode explicitly, so it is reasonable to try to remove at least some complications.
Tensed logical connections are both more complex and more important than logical connections between tenses. Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.158. **
I went to the market, and I bought food.
  

The verbatim translation of Example 14.158, namely:
**Example 14.159. **
mi | pu | klama | le | zarci | .ije | mi | pu | tervecnu | lo | cidja  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | go-to | the | market. | And | I | [past] | buy | items-of | food.  
  

fails to fully represent a feature of the English, namely that the buying came after the going. (It also fails to represent that the buying was a consequence of the going, which can be expressed by a modal that is discussed in Chapter 9.) However, the tense information – that the event of my going to the market preceded the event of my buying food – can be added to the logical connective as follows. The __.i__ __je__ is replaced by __.i__ __je__ __bo__ , and the tense cmavo __ba__ is inserted between __.i__ __je__ and __bo__ :
**Example 14.160. **
mi | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | go-to | the | market.  
.ije | babo | mi | pu | tervecnu | lo | cidja  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
And | [later] | I | [past] | buy | items-of | food.  
  

Here the __pu__ cmavo in the two bridi-tails express the time of both actions with respect to the speaker: in the past. The __ba__ relates the two items to one another: the second item is later than the first item. The grammar does not permit omitting the __bo__ ; if it were omitted, the __ba__ and the second __pu__ would run together to form a compound tense __bapu__ applying to the second bridi-tail only.
Adding tense or modal information to a logical connective is permitted only in the following situations:
Between an ek (or joik) and __bo__ , as in:
**Example 14.161. **
la | .djan | .e | cabo | la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | and | [simultaneous] | that-named | Alice | go-to | the | market.  
John and Alice go to the market simultaneously.  
---  
  

Between an ek (or joik) and __ke__ , as in:
**Example 14.162. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | pu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | [earlier]  
ke | le | zdani | .a | le | ckule | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | the | house | or | the | school | ).  
I walk to the market and, before that, to the house or the school.  
---  
  

Between a gihek and __bo__ , as in:
**Example 14.163. **
mi | dunda | le | cukta | gi'e | babo  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | give | the | book | and | [later]  
lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
take | some | currency-units |  | from/to-you.  
I give you the book and then take some dollars (pounds, yen) from you.  
---  
  

Between a gihek and __ke__ , as in:
**Example 14.164. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | gi'e | ca  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | [simultaneous]  
ke | cusku | zo'e | la | djan. | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | express | something | to-that-named | John. | )  
I walk to the market and at the same time talk to John.  
---  
  

Between an ijek (or ijoik) and __bo__ , as in:
**Example 14.165. **
mi | viska | pa | nanmu | .ije | babo | mi | viska | pa | ninmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | man. | And | [later] | I | see | a | woman.  
I see a man, and then I see a woman.  
---  
  

Between an ijek (or ijoik) and __tu'e__ , as in:
**Example 14.166. **
mi | viska | pa | nanmu | .ije | batu'e | mi | viska | pa | ninmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | man. | And | [later] | I | see | a | woman.  
I see a man, and then I see a woman.  
---  
  

And finally, between a jek (or joik) and __bo__ , as in:
**Example 14.167. **
mi | mikce | jebabo | ricfu  
---|---|---|---  
I | am-a-doctor | and-[later] | rich  
I am a doctor and future rich person.  
---  
  

As can be seen from Example 14.165 and Example 14.166, the choice between __bo__ and __ke__ (or __tu'e__) is arbitrary when there are only two things to be connected. If there were no tense information to include, of course neither would be required; it is only the rule that tense information must always be sandwiched between the logical connective and a following __bo__ , __ke__ , or __tu'e__ that requires the use of one of these grouping cmavo in Example 14.161 and Example 14.163 through Example 14.167.
Non-logical connectives with __bo__ and __ke__ can include tense information in exactly the same way as logical connectives. Forethought connectives, however (except as noted below) are unable to do so, as are termsets or tense connectives. Mathematical operands and operators can also include tense information in their logical connectives as a result of their close parallelism with sumti and tanru components respectively:
**Example 14.168. **
vei | ci | .ebabo | vo | [ve'o] | tadni | cu | zvati | le | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | 3 | and-[future] | 4 | ) | students |  | are-at | the | room.  
Three and, later, four students were in the room.  
---  
  

is a simple example. There is a special grammatical rule for use when a tense applies to both of the selbri in a forethought bridi-tail connection: the entire forethought construction can just be preceded by a tense. For example:
**Example 14.169. **
mi | pu | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | tervecnu | lo | cidja  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | both | go-to | the | market | and | buy | some | food  
I went to the market and bought some food.  
---  
  

Example 14.169 is similar to Example 14.159. There is no time relationship specified between the going and the buying; both are simply set in the past.
