# Chapter 21. Formal Grammars
## 21.1. EBNF Grammar of Lojban
Lojban Machine Grammar, EBNF Version, Final Baseline
This EBNF document is explicitly dedicated to the public domain by its author, The Logical Language Group, Inc. Contact that organization at: 2904 Beau Lane, Fairfax VA 22031 USA 703-385-0273 (intl: +1 703 385 0273)
Explanation of notation: All rules have the form:
name number= bnf-expression
which means that the grammatical construct “name” is defined by “bnf-expression”. The number cross-references this grammar with the rule numbers in the YACC grammar. The names are the same as those in the YACC grammar, except that subrules are labeled with A, B, C, ... in the YACC grammar and with 1, 2, 3, ... in this grammar. In addition, rule 971 is “simple_tag” in the YACC grammar but “stag” in this grammar, because of its frequent appearance.
  1. Names in lower case are grammatical constructs.
  2. Names in UPPER CASE are selma'o (lexeme) names, and are terminals.
  3. Concatenation is expressed by juxtaposition with no operator symbol.
  4. | represents alternation (choice).
  5. [] represents an optional element.
  6. & represents and/or (“A & B” is the same as “A | B | A B”).
  7. ... represents optional repetition of the construct to the left. Left-grouping is implied; right-grouping is shown by explicit self-referential recursion with no “...”
  8. () serves to indicate the grouping of the other operators. Otherwise, “...” binds closer than &, which binds closer than |.
  9. # is shorthand for “[free ...]”, a construct which appears in many places.
  10. // encloses an elidable terminator, which may be omitted (without change of meaning) if no grammatical ambiguity results.

## 14.16. Interval connectives and forethought non-logical connection
In addition to the non-logical connectives of selma'o JOI explained in Section 14.14 and Section 14.15, there are three other connectives which can appear in joiks: __bi'i__ , __bi'o__ , and __mi'i__ , all of selma'o BIhI. The first two cmavo are used to specify intervals: abstract objects defined by two endpoints. The cmavo __bi'i__ is correct if the endpoints are independent of order, whereas __bi'o__ or __se__ __bi'o__ are used when order matters.
An example of __bi'i__ in sumti connection:
**Example 14.138. **
mi | ca | sanli  
---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand-on-surface  
la | drezdn. | bi'i | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Dresden | [interval] | that-named | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt.  
---  
  

In Example 14.138, it is all the same whether I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt or between Frankfurt and Dresden, so __bi'i__ is the appropriate interval connective. The sumti _la drezdn. bi'i la frankfurt._ falls into the x2 place of __sanli__ , which is the surface I stand on; the interval specifies that surface by its limits. (Obviously, I am not standing on the whole of the interval; the x2 place of __sanli__ specifies a surface which is typically larger in extent than just the size of the stander's feet.)
**Example 14.139. **
mi | cadzu | ca | la | pacac.  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk | simultaneous-with |  | First-hour  
bi'o | la | recac.  
---|---|---  
[ordered-interval] |  | Second-hour.  
I walk from one o'clock to two o'clock.  
---  
  

In Example 14.139, on the other hand, it is essential that _la pacac._ comes before _la recac._ ; otherwise we have an 11-hour (or 23-hour) interval rather than a one-hour interval. In this use of an interval, the whole interval is probably intended, or at least most of it.
Example 14.139 is equivalent to:
**Example 14.140. **
mi | cadzu | ca | la | recac.  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk | simultaneous-with |  | Second-hour  
se | bi'o | la | pacac.  
---|---|---|---  
[reverse] | [ordered] |  | First-hour.  
  

English cannot readily express __se__ __bi'o__ , but its meaning can be understood by reversing the two sumti.
The third cmavo of selma'o BIhI, namely __mi'i__ , expresses an interval seen from a different viewpoint: not a pair of endpoints, but a center point and a distance. For example:
**Example 14.141. **
le | jbama | pu | daspo | la | .uacintyn.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | bomb | [past] | destroys |  | Washington  
mi'i | lo | minli | be | li | muno  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[center] | what-is | measured-in-miles |  | by | 50.  
The bomb destroyed Washington and fifty miles around.  
---  
  

Here we have an interval whose center is Washington and whose distance, or radius, is fifty miles.
In Example 14.138, is it possible that I am standing in Dresden (or Frankfurt) itself? Yes. The connectives of selma'o BIhI are ambiguous about whether the endpoints themselves are included in or excluded from the interval. Two auxiliary cmavo __ga'o__ and __ke'i__ (of cmavo GAhO) are used to indicate the status of the endpoints: __ga'o__ means that the endpoint is included, __ke'i__ that it is excluded:
**Example 14.142. **
mi | ca | sanli | la | drezdn. | ga'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand | that-named | Dresden | [inclusive]  
bi'i | ga'o | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---  
[interval] | [inclusive] | that-named | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt, inclusive of both.  
---  
  

**Example 14.143. **
mi | ca | sanli | la | drezdn. | ga'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand | that-named | Dresden | [inclusive]  
bi'i | ke'i | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---  
[interval] | [exclusive] | that-named | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden (inclusive) and Frankfurt (exclusive).  
---  
  

**Example 14.144. **
mi | ca | sanli | la | drezdn. | ke'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand | that-named | Dresden | [exclusive]  
bi'i | ga'o | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---  
[interval] | [inclusive] | that-named | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden (exclusive) and Frankfurt (inclusive).  
---  
  

**Example 14.145. **
mi | ca | sanli | la | drezdn. | ke'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand | that-named | Dresden | [exclusive]  
bi'i | ke'i | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---  
[interval] | [exclusive] | that-named | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt, exclusive of both.  
---  
  

As these examples should make clear, the GAhO cmavo that applies to a given endpoint is the one that stands physically adjacent to it: the left-hand endpoint is referred to by the first GAhO, and the right-hand endpoint by the second GAhO. It is ungrammatical to have just one GAhO.
(Etymologically, __ga'o__ is derived from __ganlo__ , which means “closed”, and __ke'i__ from __kalri__ , which means “open”. In mathematics, inclusive intervals are referred to as closed intervals, and exclusive intervals as open ones.)
BIhI joiks are grammatical anywhere that other joiks are, including in tanru connection and (as ijoiks) between sentences. No meanings have been found for these uses.
Negated intervals, marked with a _-nai_ following the BIhI cmavo, indicate an interval that includes everything but what is between the endpoints (with respect to some understood scale):
**Example 14.146. **
do | dicra | .e'a | mi | ca | la | daucac.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | disturb | (allowed) | me | at | that-named | 10  
bi'onai | la | gaicac.  
---|---|---  
not-from-...-to | that-named | 12  
You can contact me except from 10 to 12.  
---  
  

The complete syntax of joiks is: 
>   * [se] JOI [nai] 
>   * [se] BIhI [nai] 
>   * GAhO [se] BIhI [nai] GAhO 
> 

Notice that the colloquial English translations of __bi'i__ and __bi'o__ have forethought form: “between ... and” for __bi'i__ , and “from ... to” for __bi'o__. In Lojban too, non-logical connectives can be expressed in forethought. Rather than using a separate selma'o, the forethought logical connectives are constructed from the afterthought ones by suffixing __gi__. Such a compound cmavo is not unnaturally called a “joigik”; the syntax of joigiks is any of: 
>   * [se] JOI [nai] GI 
>   * [se] BIhI [nai] GI 
>   * GAhO [se] BIhI [nai] GAhO GI 
> 

Joigiks may be used to non-logically connect bridi, sumti, and bridi-tails; and also in termsets.
Example 14.111 in forethought becomes:
**Example 14.147. **
joigi | la | djan. | gi | la | .alis. | bevri | le | pipno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[Together] | that-named | John | and | that-named | Alice | carry | the | piano.  
  

The first __gi__ is part of the joigik; the second __gi__ is the regular gik that separates the two things being connected in all forethought forms.
Example 14.143 can be expressed in forethought as:
**Example 14.148. **
mi | ca | sanli | ke'i | bi'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand | [exclusive] | between  
ga'o | gi | la | drezdn. | gi | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[inclusive] | and | that-named | Dresden | and | that-named | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden (exclusive) and Frankfurt (inclusive).  
---  
  

In forethought, unfortunately, the GAhOs become physically separated from the endpoints, but the same rule applies: the first GAhO refers to the first endpoint.

## 10.19. Actuality, potentiality, capability: CAhA
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ca'a |  CAhA |  actually is  
---|---|---  
ka'e |  CAhA |  is innately capable of  
nu'o |  CAhA |  can but has not  
pu'i |  CAhA |  can and has  
Lojban bridi without tense markers may not necessarily refer to actual events: they may also refer to capabilities or potential events. For example:
**Example 10.138. **
ro | datka | cu | flulimna  
---|---|---|---  
All | ducks |  | are-float-swimmers.  
All ducks swim by floating.  
---  
  

is a Lojban truth, even though the colloquial English translation is false or at best ambiguous. This is because the tenseless Lojban bridi doesn't necessarily claim that every duck is swimming or floating now or even at a specific time or place. Even if we add a tense marker to Example 10.138,
**Example 10.139. **
ro | datka | ca | flulimna  
---|---|---|---  
All | ducks | [present] | are-float-swimmers.  
All ducks are now swimming by floating.  
---  
  

the resulting Example 10.139 might still be considered a truth, even though the colloquial English seems even more likely to be false. All ducks have the potential of swimming even if they are not exercising that potential at present. To get the full flavor of “All ducks are now swimming”, we must append a marker from selma'o CAhA to the tense, and say:
**Example 10.140. **
ro | datka | ca | ca'a | flulimna  
---|---|---|---|---  
All | ducks | [present] | [actual] | are-float-swimmers.  
All ducks are now actually swimming by floating.  
---  
  

A CAhA cmavo is always placed after any other tense cmavo, whether for time or for space. However, a CAhA cmavo comes before __ki__ , so that a CAhA condition can be made sticky.
Example 10.140 is false in both Lojban and English, since it claims that the swimming is an actual, present fact, true of every duck that exists, whereas in fact there is at least one duck that is not swimming now.
Furthermore, some ducks are dead (and therefore sink); some ducks have just hatched (and do not know how to swim yet), and some ducks have been eaten by predators (and have ceased to exist as separate objects at all). Nevertheless, all these ducks have the innate capability of swimming – it is part of the nature of duckhood. The cmavo __ka'e__ expresses this notion of innate capability:
**Example 10.141. **
ro | datka | ka'e | flulimna  
---|---|---|---  
All | ducks | [capable] | are-float-swimmers.  
All ducks are innately capable of swimming.  
---  
  

Under some epistemologies, innate capability can be extended in order to apply the innate properties of a mass to which certain individuals belong to the individuals themselves, even if those individuals are themselves not capable of fulfilling the claim of the bridi. For example:
**Example 10.142. **
la | djan. | ka'e | viska  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [capable] | sees.  
John is innately capable of seeing.  
---  
John can see.  
  

might be true about a human being named John, even though he has been blind since birth, because the ability to see is innately built into his nature as a human being. It is theoretically possible that conditions might occur that would enable John to see (a great medical discovery, for example). On the other hand,
**Example 10.143. **
le | cukta | ka'e | viska  
---|---|---|---  
The | book | [capable] | sees.  
The book can see.  
---  
  

is not true in most epistemologies, since the ability to see is not part of the innate nature of a book.
Consider once again the newly hatched ducks mentioned earlier. They have the potential of swimming, but have not yet demonstrated that potential. This may be expressed using __nu'o__ , the cmavo of CAhA for undemonstrated potential:
**Example 10.144. **
ro | cifydatka | nu'o | flulimna  
---|---|---|---  
All | infant-ducks | [can-but-has-not] | are-float-swimmers.  
All infant ducks have an undemonstrated potential for swimming by floating.  
---  
Baby ducks can swim but haven't yet.  
  

Contrariwise, if Frank is not blind from birth, then __pu'i__ is appropriate:
**Example 10.145. **
la | frank. | pu'i | viska  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | [can-and-has] | sees.  
Frank has demonstrated a potential for seeing.  
---  
Frank can see and has seen.  
  

Note that the glosses given at the beginning of this section for __ca'a__ , __nu'o__ , and __pu'i__ incorporate __ca__ into their meaning, and are really correct for _ca ca'a_ , _ca nu'o_ , and _ca pu'i_. However, the CAhA cmavo are perfectly meaningful with other tenses than the present:
**Example 10.146. **
mi | pu | ca'a | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [actual] | go-to | the | store.  
I actually went to the store.  
---  
  

**Example 10.147. **
la | frank. | ba | nu'o | klama | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | [future] | [can-but-has-not] | goes-to | the | store.  
Frank could have, but will not have, gone to the store (at some understood moment in the future).  
---  
  

As always in Lojban tenses, a missing CAhA can have an indeterminate meaning, or the context can be enough to disambiguate it. Saying
**Example 10.148. **
ta | jelca  
---|---  
That | burns/is-burning/might-burn/will-burn.  
  

with no CAhA specified can translate the two very different English sentences “That is on fire” and “That is inflammable.” The first demands immediate action (usually), whereas the second merely demands caution. The two cases can be disambiguated with:
**Example 10.149. **
ta | ca | ca'a | jelca  
---|---|---|---  
That | [present] | [actual] | burns.  
That is on fire.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.150. **
ta | ka'e | jelca  
---|---|---  
That | [capable] | burns.  
That is capable of burning.  
---  
That is inflammable.  
  

When no indication is given, as in the simple observative
**Example 10.151. **
jelca  
---  
It burns!  
---  
  

the prudent Lojbanist will assume the meaning “Fire!”

## 14.7. More than two propositions
So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.
Of the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,
**Example 14.31. **
mi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,
**Example 14.32. **
mi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that one or more of the component sentences is true.
O, however, is different. Working out the truth table for
**Example 14.33. **
mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  
  

shows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:
> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.
Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.
In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.
There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: 
**Example 14.34. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  
.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

Does this mean:
**Example 14.35. **
I like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.
  

Or is the correct translation:
**Example 14.36. **
Either I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.
  

Example 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:
**Example 14.37. **
ga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | I | like | that-named | Martha)  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas
**Example 14.38. **
ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary).  
  

is not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.

## 14.8. Grouping of afterthought connectives
There are several ways in Lojban to render Example 14.35 using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo __bo__ (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with __bo__ are interpreted before connections not so marked. Example 14.39 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.38:
**Example 14.39. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John, | and | I | like | that-named | Martha  
.ijabo | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by __.i__ __ja__ first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by __.i__ __je__.
Eks can have __bo__ attached in exactly the same way, so that Example 14.40 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39:
**Example 14.40. **
mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with __bo__ , for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.
What happens if __bo__ is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in Example 14.41?
**Example 14.41. **
mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Does this wind up meaning the same as Example 14.34 and Example 14.36? Not at all. A second rule relating to __bo__ is that where several __bo__ -marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, Example 14.41 in fact means the same as Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with __bo__ should be avoided.
The use of __bo__ , therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of Example 14.37 and Example 14.38, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ are used with ijeks, and __ke__ and __ke'e__ with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (__ke__ and __ke'e__ are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.42. **
I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
  

where the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express Example 14.42 in afterthought, we can say:
**Example 14.43. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije[bo] | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me,  
.ijanai | mi | prami | do | .ijebo | do | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | I | love | you | and | you | love | me.  
  

marking two of the ijeks with __bo__ for high precedence. (The first __bo__ is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)
But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:
**Example 14.44. **
tu'e | mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me | )  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

where the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ pairs set off the structure. The cmavo __tu'u__ is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in Example 14.44 is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.
In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to __bo__ grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.
Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:
**Example 14.45. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider
**Example 14.46. **
I walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.
  

Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to Example 14.44, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with __ke__ , so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing Example 14.47, which is instead parallel to Example 14.45:
**Example 14.47. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | the | house  
.a | ke | le | ckule | .e | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | the | school | and | the | office | ).  
  

If sumti were allowed to begin with __ke__ , unavoidable ambiguities would result, so __ke__ grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to __tu'e__ grouping of bridi, as Example 14.44 shows.
Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of Example 14.33: “I am German, rich, and a man – or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:
**Example 14.48. **
[tu'e] | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-rich | )  
.ije | tu'e | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | nanmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | ( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-a-man | ).  
  

The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 2.16. Indicators
Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. “Aha!”, “Oh no!”, “Ouch!”, “Aahh!”, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.
Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left. For example:
**Example 2.79. **
.ie |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Agreement! |  I |  - |  go.  
Yep! I'll go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.80. **
.ei |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Obligation! |  I |  - |  go.  
I should go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.81. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  le melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go |  to-the beautiful-thing  
.ui |  [ku]  
---|---  
and I am happy because it is the beautiful thing I'm going to |  -  
  

Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison, the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means “and”.
**Example 2.82. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  You |  - |  stay.  
  

**Example 2.83. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ji'a |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  In addition, |  you |  - |  stay. |  added weight  
  

**Example 2.84. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ku'i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  However, |  you |  - |  stay. |  contrast  
  

Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”. Evidentials show the speaker's relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include __za'a__ (I directly observe the relationship), __pe'i__ (I believe that the relationship holds), __ru'a__ (I postulate the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.
**Example 2.85. **
pe'i |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I opine! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.  
  

**Example 2.86. **
za'a |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I directly observe! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.

## 14.6. sumti connection
Geks and ijeks are sufficient to state every possible logical connection between two bridi. However, it is often the case that two bridi to be logically connected have one or more portions in common:
**Example 14.25. **
la | djan. | klama | le | zarci | .ije | la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
John goes to the market, and Alice goes to the market.  
---  
  

Here only a single sumti differs between the two bridi. Lojban does not require that both bridi be expressed in full. Instead, a single bridi can be given which contains both of the different sumti and uses a logical connective from a different selma'o to combine the two sumti:
**Example 14.26. **
la | djan | .e | la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | and | that-named | Alice | go-to | the | market.  
  

Example 14.26 means exactly the same thing as Example 14.25: one may be rigorously transformed into the other without any change of logical meaning. This rule is true in general for every different kind of logical connection in Lojban; all of them, with one exception (see Section 14.12), can always be transformed into a logical connection between sentences that expresses the same truth function.
The afterthought logical connectives between sumti are eks, which contain a connective cmavo of selma'o A. If ijeks were used in Example 14.26, the meaning would be changed:
**Example 14.27. **
la | djan. |  | .ije  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [is/does-something]. | And  
la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Alices | goes-to | the | market.  
  

leaving the reader uncertain why John is mentioned at all.
Any ek may be used between sumti, even if there is no direct English equivalent:
**Example 14.28. **
la | djan. | .o | la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | if-and-only-if | that-named | Alice | goes-to | the | market.  
John goes to the market if, and only if, Alice does.  
---  
  

The second line of Example 14.27 is highly stilted English, but the first line (of which it is a literal translation) is excellent Lojban.
What about forethought sumti connection? As is the case for bridi connection, geks are appropriate. They are not the only selma'o of forethought logical-connectives, but are the most commonly used ones.
**Example 14.29. **
ga | la | djan. | gi | la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either John or Alice (or both) goes to the market.  
---  
  

Of course, eks include all the same patterns of compound cmavo that ijeks do. When __na__ or __se__ is part of an ek, a special writing convention is invoked, as in the following example:
**Example 14.30. **
la | djan. | na.a | la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | only-if | that-named | Alice | goes-to | the | market.  
John goes to the market only if Alice does.  
---  
  

Note the period in __na__ __.a__. The cmavo of A begin with vowels, and therefore must always be preceded by a pause. It is conventional to write all connective compounds as single words (with no spaces), but this pause must still be marked in writing as in speech; otherwise, the __na__ and __a__ would tend to run together.

## 5.13. Tenses and bridi negation
A bridi can have cmavo associated with it which specify the time, place, or mode of action. For example, in
**Example 5.127. **
mi | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | go-to | the | market.  
I went to the market.  
---  
  

the cmavo __pu__ specifies that the action of the speaker going to the market takes place in the past. Tenses are explained in full detail in Chapter 10. Tense is semantically a property of the entire bridi; however, the usual syntax for tenses attaches them at the front of the selbri, as in Example 5.127. There are alternative ways of expressing tense information as well. Modals, which are explained in Chapter 9, behave in the same way as tenses.
Similarly, a bridi may have the particle __na__ (of selma'o NA) attached to the beginning of the selbri to negate the bridi. A negated bridi expresses what is false without saying anything about what is true. Do not confuse this usage with the scalar negation of Section 5.12. For example:
**Example 5.128. **
la | djonz. | na | pamoi | cusku  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Jones | (Not!) | is-the-first | speaker  
It is not true that Jones is the first speaker.  
---  
Jones isn't the first speaker.  
  

Jones may be the second speaker, or not a speaker at all; Example 5.128 doesn't say. There are other ways of expressing bridi negation as well; the topic is explained fully in Chapter 15.
Various combinations of tense and bridi negation cmavo are permitted. If both are expressed, either order is permissible with no change in meaning:
**Example 5.129. **
mi | na | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is false that I went to the market.  
---  
I didn't go to the market.  
  

It is also possible to have more than one __na__ , in which case pairs of __na__ cmavo cancel out:
**Example 5.130. **
mi | na | na | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is false that it is false that I go to the market.  
---  
I go to the market.  
  

It is even possible, though somewhat pointless, to have multiple __na__ cmavo and tense cmavo mixed together, subject to the limitation that two adjacent tense cmavo will be understood as a compound tense, and must fit the grammar of tenses as explained in Chapter 10.
**Example 5.131. **
mi | na | pu | na | ca | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [not] | [past] | [not] | [present] | go-to | the | market  
It is not the case that in the past it was not the case that in the present I went to the market.  
---  
I didn't not go to the market.  
I went to the market.  
  

Tense, modal, and negation cmavo can appear only at the beginning of the selbri. They cannot be embedded within it.

## 15.2. bridi negation
In discussing Lojban negation, we will call the form of logical negation that simply denies the truth of a statement “bridi negation”. Using bridi negation, we can say the equivalent of “I haven't stopped beating my wife” without implying that I ever started, nor even that I have a wife, meaning simply “It isn't true that I have stopped beating my wife.” Since Lojban uses bridi as smaller components of complex sentences, bridi negation is permitted in these components as well at the sentence level.
For the bridi negation of a sentence to be true, the sentence being negated must be false. A major use of bridi negation is in making a negative response to a yes/no question; such responses are usually contradictory, denying the truth of the entire sentence. A negative answer to
**Example 15.11. **
Did you go to the store?
  

is taken as a negation of the entire sentence, equivalent to
**Example 15.12. **
No, I didn't go to the store.
  

The most important rule about bridi negation is that if a bridi is true, its negation is false, and vice versa.
The simplest way to express a bridi negation is to use the cmavo __na__ of selma'o NA before the selbri of the affirmative form of the bridi (but after the __cu__ , if there is one):
**Example 15.13. **
mi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store.  
  

when negated becomes:
**Example 15.14. **
mi | na | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [false] | go-to | the | store.  
  

Note that we have used a special convention to show in the English that a bridi negation is present. We would like to use the word “not”, because this highlights the naturalness of putting the negation marker just before the selbri, and makes the form easier to learn. But there is a major difference between Lojban's bridi negation with __na__ and natural language negation with “not”. In English, the word “not” can apply to a single word, to a phrase, to an English predicate, or to the entire sentence. In addition, “not” may indicate either contradictory negation or another form of negation, depending on the sentence. Lojban's internal bridi negation, on the other hand, always applies to an entire bridi, and is always a contradictory negation; that is, it contradicts the claim of the whole bridi.
Because of the ambiguity of English “not”, we will use “[false]” in the translation of Lojban examples to remind the reader that we are expressing a contradictory negation. Here are more examples of bridi negation:
**Example 15.15. **
mi | [cu] | na | ca | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | [false] | now | am-a-go-er-to | the | market.  
I am not going to the market now.  
---  
  

**Example 15.16. **
lo | ca | nolraitru | be  
---|---|---|---  
The-actual | present | noblest-governor | of  
le | fasygu'e | cu | na | krecau  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | French-country |  | [false] | is-hair-without.  
The current king of France isn't bald.  
---  
  

**Example 15.17. **
ti | na | barda | prenu | co | melbi | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | [false] | is-a-big | person | of-type | (beautiful-to | me).  
This isn't a big person who is beautiful to me.  
---  
  

Although there is this fundamental difference between Lojban's internal bridi negation and English negation, we note that in many cases, especially when there are no existential or quantified variables (the cmavo __da__ , __de__ , and __di__ of selma'o KOhA, explained in Chapter 16) in the bridi, you can indeed translate Lojban __na__ as “not” (or “isn't” or “doesn't”, as appropriate).
The most important rule about bridi negation is that if a bridi is true, its negation is false, and vice versa.
In Lojban, there are several structures that implicitly contain bridi, so that Lojban sentences may contain more than one occurrence of __na__. For example:
**Example 15.18. **
mi | na | gleki | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [false] | am-happy-about | the | event-of  
na | klama | le | nu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---  
([false] | going-to | the | event-of | dancing).  
It is not the case that I am happy about it not being the case that I am going to the dance.  
---  
I am not happy about not going to the dance.  
  

In the previous example, we used internal negations in abstraction bridi; bridi negation may also be found in descriptions within sumti. For example:
**Example 15.19. **
mi | nelci | le | na | melbi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-fond-of | the-one-described-as | ([false] | beautiful).  
I am fond of the one who isn't beautiful.  
---  
  

A more extreme (and more indefinite) example is:
**Example 15.20. **
mi | nelci | lo | na  
---|---|---|---  
I | am-fond-of | one-who-is | ([false]  
ca | nolraitru | be | le | frasygu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
the-current | king | of | the | French-country).  
I am fond of one who isn't the current king of France.  
---  
  

The claim of Example 15.20 could apply to anyone except a person who is fond of no one at all, since the relation within the description is false for everyone. You cannot readily express these situations in colloquial English.
Negation with __na__ applies to an entire bridi, and not to just part of a selbri. Therefore, you won't likely have reason to put __na__ inside a tanru. In fact, the grammar currently does not allow you to do so (except in a lujvo and in elaborate constructs involving GUhA, the forethought connector for selbri). Any situation where you might want to do so can be expressed in a less-compressed non-tanru form. This grammatical restriction helps ensure that bridi negation is kept separate from other forms of negation.
The grammar of __na__ allows multiple adjacent negations, which cancel out, as in normal logic:
**Example 15.21. **
ti | na | na | barda | prenu | co | melbi | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | [false] | [false] | is-a-big | person | that | is-(beautiful-to | me).  
  

which is the same as:
**Example 15.22. **
ti | barda | prenu | co | melbi | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-big | person | that | is-(beautiful-to | me).  
  

When a selbri is tagged with a tense or a modal, negation with __na__ is permitted in two positions: before or after the tag. No semantic difference between these forms has yet been defined, but this is not finally determined, since the interactions between tenses/modals and bridi negation have not been fully explored. In particular, it remains to be seen whether sentences using less familiar tenses, such as:
**Example 15.23. **
mi | [cu] | ta'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | habitually | go-to | the | market.  
  

mean the same thing with __na__ before the __ta'e__ , as when the negation occurs afterwards; we'll let future, Lojban-speaking, logicians decide on how they relate to each other.
A final caution on translating English negations into Lojban: if you translate the English literally, you'll get the wrong one. With English causal statements, and other statements with auxiliary clauses, this problem is more likely.
Thus, if you translate the English:
**Example 15.24. **
I do not go to the market because the car is broken.
  

as:
**Example 15.25. **
mi | na | klama | le | zarci | ki'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [false] | go-to | the | market | because-of  
lenu | le | karce | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---  
the-event-of | the | car |  | is-broken.  
It is false that: I go to the market because the car is broken.  
---  
  

you end up negating too much.
Such mistranslations result from the ambiguity of English compounded by the messiness of natural language negation. A correct translation of the normal interpretation of Example 15.24 is:
**Example 15.26. **
le | nu | mi | na | klama | le | zarci | cu | se | krinu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | (my | [false] | going-to | the | market) |  |  | is-justified-by  
le | nu | le | karce | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | (the | car |  | being-broken).  
My not going to the market is because the car is broken.  
---  
  

In Example 15.26, the negation is clearly confined to the event abstraction in the x1 sumti, and does not extend to the whole sentence. The English could also have been expressed by two separate sentences joined by a causal connective (which we'll not go into here).
The problem is not confined to obvious causals. In the English:
**Example 15.27. **
I was not conscripted into the Army with the help of my uncle the Senator.
  

we do not intend the uncle's help to be part of the negation. We must thus move the negation into an event clause or use two separate sentences. The event-clause version would look like:
**Example 15.28. **
The event-of (my [false] being-conscripted-into the Army) was aided by my uncle the Senator.
  

It is possible that someone will want to incorporate bridi negations into lujvo. For this reason, the rafsi _-nar-_ has been reserved for __na__. However, before using this rafsi, make sure that you intend the contradictory bridi negation, and not the scalar negation described in Section 15.3, which will be much more common in tanru and lujvo.
