(/LOZH-bahn/) is a constructed
language. Originally called 'Loglan'<A

project founder Dr. James Cooke Brown,<A

in 1955, the goals for the language were first described in the article
<I

>Loglan</I
> in <I
CLASS="citetitle"
>Scientific
American</I
>, June 1960. Made well-known by that article and by
occasional references in science fiction and computer publications,
Loglan/Lojban has been built over four decades by dozens of workers and
hundreds of supporters, led since 1987 by <A

>Lojban was originally designed to support
research on a concept known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis<A

expressed, this hypothesis states that the structure of a language
constrains the thinking of people using that language. Lojban allows the
full expressive capability of a natural language, but differs in structure
from other languages in major ways. This allows it to be used as a test vehicle<A
NAME="idx6"

for scientists studying the relationships between language, thought, and
culture. If you are reading this as part of the introductory booklet, further discussion of these issues can be found in the section <A

computer-human interaction<A

structure is similar to existing artificial intelligence (AI)<A

languages, and it may become be a most powerful adjunct to AI research,
especially in the storing and processing of data about the world and
people's conceptions of it. There are also linguists interested in Lojban's
potential as an intermediate language in computer-aided translation<A
NAME="idx10"
></A
><A
NAME="idx11"
></A
><A
NAME="idx45"

natural languages; and Lojban is of interest as a potential stepping-stone
for students learning other languages. Because Lojban was designed to be
culturally neutral<A
NAME="idx12"
></A
>, and has a powerful vocabulary easily learned by people
of different language origins, some are interested in Lojban's potential as
an international language<A

applications that will be developed in the future.</P

natural language, it is only a matter of time before Lojban-based computer
applications<A

to know anything about computers or to talk like one.</P

sound?</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="answer"
><P
><B
> </B
>Lojban uses letters of the Roman alphabet to represent its 6
vowels and 17 consonants<A
NAME="idx14"
></A
>. The Lojban character set uses only standard
typewriter/computer keyboard keys; capitalization<A
NAME="idx15"
></A
> is used rarely, and only to
indicate unusual stress in the pronunciation of names. Punctuation<A
NAME="idx16"
></A
> is
spoken as words. The written language corresponds exactly to the sounds of
the spoken language; spelling is phonetic and unambiguous, and the flowing
sounds of the language break down into words in only one possible way. These features make
computer speech recognition and transcription more practical. Learning to
pronounce and spell Lojban is trivial.</P
><P
>Lojban has a smooth, rhythmic sound, somewhat like Italian. However,
its consonants create a fullness and power found in Slavic languages like
Russian, and the large number of vowel pairs impart a hint of Chinese,
Polynesian, and other Oriental languages, though without the tones that make
many of those languages difficult for others to learn.</P
><P
>Because there are no idioms to shorten expressions, a Lojban text can be
longer than the corresponding colloquial English text. The
unambiguous linguistic structures that result are a major benefit that makes this
worthwhile; and Lojban has constructions of its own that are rather more succinct than their equivalents in English (such as logic-specific formulations, and expressions of attitude.) Moreover, much of the disambiguating machinery of Lojban is optional; you use them only when you <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>need</I
> to use them.</P
><P
>As an example of Lojban, Occam's Razor ("The simplest
explanation is usually the best") may be translated as:

CLASS="answer"

><B
> </B
>'Grammar' is a word with painful
memories for many of us. But though Lojban grammar seems strange at first
sight, it is actually quite simple. It is based on a system called
predicate logic, which states that in any sentence you have a
<B
CLASS="firstterm"
>relationship</B
><A
NAME="idx17"
></A
><A
NAME="idx18"

CLASS="foreignphrase"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>sumti</I
></TT
>)<A
NAME="idx20"
></A
><A
NAME="idx21"
></A
>. An argument can be a thing,
event, quality or just about anything.
To give an example, the English sentence

<BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
CLASS="literallayout"
><I
CLASS="wordasword"
>Chris adores Pat</I
>&nbsp;</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
>has a relation <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>adore</I
>, between two arguments,
<I
CLASS="wordasword"
>Chris</I
> and <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>Pat</I
>. In Lojban
this would be

<BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
CLASS="literallayout"
><TT
CLASS="foreignphrase"
>la kris. prami la pat.</TT
></P
></BLOCKQUOTE
>or, if you prefer,

<BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="informalexample"

CLASS="foreignphrase"

></P
></BLOCKQUOTE
>(The full stops mean that you have to pause slightly to separate the
words --
anythingelseinLojbancanberuntogetherwithoutbeingmisunderstood). </P
><P
>You might be thinking "Well in that case a relationship is a verb
and an argument is a noun, so why bother with special terminology like
<TT
CLASS="foreignphrase"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>selbri</I
></TT
> and
whatnot?" However, in Lojban Chris's feelings about Pat might be
described like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
CLASS="literallayout"
><TT
CLASS="foreignphrase"
>la pat. melbi</TT
><br>
Pat&nbsp;is&nbsp;beautiful.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
></P
><P
>In English you have a verb ('doing word'),
<I
CLASS="wordasword"
>is</I
>, and an adjective ('describing word'), <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>beautiful</I
>.
In Turkish, you would say <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>Pat g�zel</I
>, which is
a noun and an adjective, with no verb required. In Chinese you would use
<I
CLASS="wordasword"
>meili</I
>, a 'stative verb'
-- but enough! In Lojban you don't need all these language-specific notions. </P
><P
>Now, if there are no nouns, verbs, subjects or objects in Lojban, how
do we know that <TT
CLASS="foreignphrase"
>la kris. la pat.
prami</TT
> means that Chris adores Pat and not the other way?
Different languages handle this problem differently. In English it is done
with word order, and when that isn't enough, with prepositions (words like
<I
CLASS="wordasword"
>at</I
>, <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>from</I
>,
<I
CLASS="wordasword"
>to</I
>, <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>with</I
> and so on). In
other languages, like Latin or Turkish, it's done by changing the form of
the words, e.g. <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>Pat'i Chris sever</I
> in Turkish means
"Chris loves Pat", not "Pat loves Chris." </P
><P
>In Lojban, the order in which arguments appear is built in to the meaning of the word. For example,
the word <TT
CLASS="foreignphrase"
>dunda</TT
> means
<I
CLASS="wordasword"
>give</I
>, but its full meaning is:</P
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="informalexample"

CLASS="literallayout"
>x<SUB
>1</SUB
>&nbsp;gives&nbsp;x<SUB
>2</SUB
>&nbsp;to&nbsp;x<SUB
>3</SUB
></P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><P
>So <TT
CLASS="foreignphrase"
>mi pu dunda le cukta le
ninmu</TT
> means "I gave the book to the woman",
not "I gave the woman to the book"). </P
><P
>The important point is that Lojban has a lot of what we would call
'grammar', but nearly all of this is contained in
the <TT

></LI
></UL
></P
><P
>A major benefit of using a predicate grammar is that Lojban doesn't
have inflections and declensions on nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
Most natural languages have evolved such variations to reduce ambiguity as
to how words are related in a sentence. Language change has made
these inflections and declensions highly irregular and thus difficult to
learn. Lojban uses the simple but flexible predicate relationship to erase
both the irregularity and the declensions.</P
><P
>Tense and location markers (inflections), adverbs, and prepositions
are combined into one part of speech.<A
NAME="idx28"
></A
><A
NAME="idx29"
></A
> New preposition-like forms can be
built at will from predicates; these allow the user to expand upon a
sentence by attaching and relating arguments not normally included in the
meaning of a word.</P
><P
>Numbers and quantifiers<A
NAME="idx30"
></A
><A
NAME="idx31"
></A
> are conceptually expanded from natural
languages. <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>Many</I

CLASS="wordasword"

>,
<I
CLASS="wordasword"
>too much</I
>, <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>a few</I
>, and
<I
CLASS="wordasword"
>at least</I
> are among concepts that are expressed as
numbers in Lojban. Thus "it costs $3.95" and "it costs
too much" are grammatically identical, and one can talk of being
"enough-th in line" for tickets to a sellout movie. Core
concepts of logic, mathematics, and science are built into the root
vocabulary. They enhance discussion of those topics, and are surprisingly
useful in ordinary speech, too.</P
><P
>Predicate logic can express a wide variety of human thought; Lojban
also has non-logical constructs that do not affect or obscure the logical
structure, allowing communications that are not amenable to logical
analysis. For example, Lojban has a full set of emotional indicators<A
NAME="idx31a"
></A
>, which are similar to such
interjections in English as <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>Oh!</I
>,
<I
CLASS="wordasword"
>Aha!</I
>, and <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>Wheee!</I
>, but
each has a specific meaning. Similarly, Lojban has indicators of the
speaker's relationship to what is said (whether it is hearsay, direct observation,
logical deduction, etc.) similar to those found in some Native American
languages.</P
><P
>Lojban supports metalinguistic discussion<A
NAME="idx32"
></A
> about the sentences being
spoken while remaining unambiguous. Lojban also supports a
variety of 'tense' logic that allows one to be extremely
specific about time and space (and space-time) relationships. A substantial portion of
Lojban's grammar is designed to support unambiguous statement of
mathematical expressions<A
NAME="idx33"
></A
><A
NAME="idx34"
></A
> and relations in a manner compatible both with
international usage and the rest of Lojban's grammar.</P
><P
>Lojban 'parts of speech' are convertible
from one to another by using short structure words (called <TT
CLASS="foreignphrase"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>cmavo</I
></TT
>)<A
NAME="idx35"
></A
>. One can make numbers serve as
nouns or verbs, or invent new numbers and prepositions. Lojban removes
many of the constraints on human thought, while preserving tight control on
structural syntax.</P

><DIV
CLASS="answer"
><P
><B
> </B
>Lojban is actually much simpler than natural languages. It
is only slightly more complex in its grammar than the current generation of computer
languages (such as C++ and Perl). Lojban seems complex only because the
varieties of human thought are complex, and Lojban is designed to minimize
constraints on those thoughts. Lojban text can appear longer and more complex
due to its lack of idiom, its complete explicitness of logical structure, and
most importantly, its unfamiliarity. On the other hand, conversational
speech uses less than half of the possible grammatical structures, leaving
the rest for writing and for other circumstances when one is likely to take
time to carefully formulate exact logical phrasings.</P
><P
>Lojban's pronunciation, spelling, word formation, and grammar rules
are fixed, and the language is free of exceptions to these rules. Such
exceptions are the bane of learning to speak a natural language <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>correctly</I
>.
Without the burden of ambiguity, Lojban users
can be precise and specific more easily than in other languages.</P
><P
>Because Lojban's grammar is simple, it is easier to learn than other
languages. Using flashcard-like techniques, a working vocabulary 
including the complete set of 1350 root
words can take 8-12 weeks of study at 1 hour per day. It is by no
means uncommon for people who embark on learning Lojban to be able to write
grammatical Lojban within a few days, and to hold at least a limited
conversation within a few weeks. Natural languages, especially English,
take several years to learn to a comparable level
of skill.</P
><P
>The available Lojban teaching materials are so structured that you
can learn the language without classroom instruction or
a close community of speakers. Communication practice with others is needed
to achieve fluency, but you can start using the language as you achieve
proficiency.</P

In practice this means that the person who reads or hears a Lojban sentence
is never in doubt as to what words it contains or what roles they play in
the sentence. This is true even if the words are unfamiliar, so long as the
spelling and grammar rules are known. Lojban has no words that sound alike
but have different meanings (like <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>herd</I
> and
<I
CLASS="wordasword"
>heard</I
>), that have multiple unrelated meanings
(<I
CLASS="wordasword"
>set</I
>), or that differ only in punctuation but
not in sound (like the abominable <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>its</I
> and
<I
CLASS="wordasword"
>it's</I
>). There is never any doubt about where
words begin and end (if you hear <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>cargo
ship</I
>, do you hear two words or three?) Most important, the
function of each word is inescapably clear; there is nothing like the
English sentence <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>Time flies like an arrow</I
>, in which any of
the first three words could be the verb.</P
><P
>Lojban is <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>not</I
> entirely unambiguous, of course;
human beings occasionally desire to be ambiguous in their expressions. In
Lojban, this ambiguity is limited to semantics, <TT
CLASS="foreignphrase"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>tanru</I
></TT
> metaphor, and intentional
omission of information (ellipsis).</P
><P
>Semantic ambiguity results because words in natural languages
represent families of concepts rather than individual meanings. These
meanings often have only weak semantic relationships to each other (the
English word <I
CLASS="wordasword"
>run</I
> is a good example.) In addition, each individual's personal experiences provide
emotional connotations to words. By providing a fresh, culturally-neutral
start, Lojban attempts to minimize the transference of these associations
as people learn the language. Most Lojban words do not much resemble
corresponding words in other languages; the differences aid in making this
fresh start possible.</P
><P
>Lojban's powerful <TT
CLASS="foreignphrase"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>tanru</I
></TT
> (combinations of <TT
CLASS="foreignphrase"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>selbri</I

concepts) 
and word-building features make it easy to
make fine distinctions between concepts. This discourages the tendency for
individual words to acquire families of meanings. Lojban's
<TT
CLASS="foreignphrase"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>tanru</I
></TT
><A
NAME="idx38"
></A
> metaphors are themselves
ambiguous; they specify a relationship between concepts, but not what the
relationship is. That relationship can be made explicit using unambiguous
logical constructs if necessary, or can be left vague, as the speaker
typically desires. Similarly, portions of the logical structure of a Lojban
expression can be omitted, greatly simplifying the expression while causing
some ambiguity. Unlike in the natural languages, though, this ambiguity is
readily identified by a reader or listener. Thus all ambiguity in Lojban is
constrained and recognizable, and can be clarified as necessary by further
interaction.</P
><P
>This precision in no way confines the meaning of a Lojban sentence.
It is possible to be fanciful or ridiculous, to tell lies, or to be
misunderstood. You can be very specific, or you can be intentionally vague.

>Most humor arises from situation and character and is as
funny in Lojban as in any language. Humor based on word play, of course, is
language-dependent. Lojban has no homonyms, and hence no simple puns; puns
derived from similar sounds are still possible, and have in fact been
attempted (for example in the Lojban translation of <I
CLASS="citetitle"
>Alice in
Wonderland</I
><A
NAME="idx40"
></A
>). Since Lojban will almost always be a second
language, bilingual puns and word play abound, often based on the relative
ambiguity of the other languages involved. Humor based on internal
grammatical ambiguity is of course impossible in Lojban, but humor based on
nonsensical statements, or on logical structures that would be difficult to
clearly express in another language, becomes easier.</P
><P
>As speakers become fluent, and conventional phrases come into use,
Lojban will develop its own forms of spoonerisms and subtle puns. Unique
forms of Lojban word-play have already turned up; they exploit the way
small variations in Lojban grammar create unexpected variations in meaning,
and the capability to simply express rather mind-boggling relationships.
Like all word-play, these lose zest when translated into other
languages.</P
><P
>Related to humor is the aphorism: the pithy saying that gains
pungency or poignancy from terse, elegant phrasing. Lojban seems as capable
of aphorisms as any language, perhaps more than most; however, because the
language is so young, few such aphorisms have been devised to date.</P

>There have been hundreds of artificial international languages
developed, of which Esperanto is the most successful and widely known.
Esperanto, like most other such languages, was based on European languages
in both grammar and vocabulary. Although it manages to be relatively neutral
between them, it still retains an inherent cultural bias which makes it
unsuited for most of the purposes that Lojban was designed for.</P
><P
>Lojban is culturally fully neutral. Its vocabulary was built
algorithmically using today's six most widely spoken languages: Chinese,
Hindi, English, Russian, Spanish, and Arabic. Lojban's words thus show
roots in three major families of languages spoken by most of the world's
people. Lojban's grammar accommodates structures found in non-European
languages, and uses sounds found in many of the world's languages. Coupled
with the potential computer applications<A
NAME="idx53"
></A
> that will make Lojban a useful
language to know, Lojban's potential as an
international language may be more far-reaching than Esperanto's.</P
><P
>Lojban was not designed primarily to be an international language,
however, but rather as a linguistic tool for studying and understanding language.
Its linguistic and computer applications make Lojban unique among proposed
international languages: Lojban can be successful without
immediately being accepted and adopted everywhere, and Lojban can be useful
and interesting even to those skeptical of or hostile towards the
international language movement.</P
><P
>Since Lojban is also not in direct competition with Esperanto,
it has proven attractive to Esperantists
interested in acquiring a new perspective on their own international
language, and who feel less threatened because Lojban has different goals.

Lojban's supporters recognize that it will take decades for Lojban to
acquire both the number and variety of speakers and the extensive history
of usage that marks Esperanto culture. Meanwhile, each language community
has much to learn from the other; this process is already
well underway.</P

></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="answer"
><P
><B
> </B
>English is commonly used as an 'international
language' in the fields of science and technology, and is probably
the most widely spoken language in the world. American dominance of
technology in the twentieth century has caused massive borrowing from English into
other languages that do not have words for all these new concepts. This
dominance, and a heritage of colonialism and imperialism that has built
resentment towards American and European impositions on native cultures, has
caused recent movements in other countries <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>away</I
> from
English. The rising influence of other non-English-speaking countries on world
economics, science, and technology makes further declines in the
universality of English likely.</P
><P
>In addition, many who know English as a second language speak it only
minimally, though they may be able to read or understand many words. India
is a prominent example of a country where English is the only language more
or less understood throughout the country, which has about 1500 languages
and dialects; but the English spoken in India is often unintelligible to
Americans or Britons. In fact, English is one of the most
difficult languages to learn to use well. In countries where English is spoken
along with other languages, it has been adapted into dialects which match
the local culture and borrow words from the other local languages. Some of
these dialects are as much as 70% unintelligible to American or British
speakers, or to each other. As such, there is no single English language to
call an 'international' one.</P
><P
>Lojban is a single language, with design features to discourage
breaking up into separate languages. While it was developed primarily by Americans, and
was designed to be at least as expressive as English is, Lojban's cultural neutrality gives
equal priority to the structures and concepts of other languages and
cultures. This cultural neutrality enhances Lojban's acceptability as an
international language. Since it is as capable as English is of generating or borrowing
any words needed to support the concepts of science and technology, 
and has special advantages for computer applications<A
NAME="idx43a"
></A
>, Lojban is likely to
spread worldwide through the technological community. Far more so than
English, Lojban is simple and easy to learn for people of all
cultures.<A

doesn't need a dictionary to use and understand millions of words that can
potentially exist in the language. The absence of cultural constraints
makes consideration of new ideas and relationships easier than in natural
languages, spurring creativity. Lojban aids in communicating abstractions
by identifying their nature explicitly. Lojban is thus a very powerful
language, not only for poetry, but for discussing such abstract fields as
philosophy, physics, metaphysics, and religion.</P

>The language, then called 'Loglan'<A

first described in the 1950s by Dr. James Cooke Brown<A
NAME="idx57a"
></A
>. The 1960 Scientific
American article <I
CLASS="citetitle"
>Loglan</I
> was his call for assistance
in developing the language. A revolution in linguistics was simultaneously
taking place, resulting in a rapidly increasing knowledge of the nature of
human language; this changed the requirements for the developing language.
The first widely distributed Loglan dictionary and language description did
not appear until 1975; the incompleteness of this description and continued
development work discouraged people from learning the language.
Furthermore, computers caught up with Loglan just then, making it possible
to refine the grammar, eliminate ambiguity and mathematically prove its
absence. For over forty years, this work has been performed by volunteers, and
without financial support. Now, after several versions of the language,
people have been learning and using the current version, which is the first to be
called 'Lojban' (from the roots
"logical-language" in Lojban).</P
><P
>This version is the first version with a stable vocabulary, and the
first to have a stable and completely defined grammar. The stabilization of
the language in this version has followed a painstaking and extensive
period of research and analysis, between 1988 and 1998. Thus, in an
important sense, Lojban is a very new language. To ensure Lojban remains
stable while people learn it, the language definition is being closely
controlled; the grammar and core vocabulary have already been baselined<A
NAME="idx58"
></A
> (frozen)
for several years. When the number of speakers has grown significantly, and
a Lojban literature has developed, Lojban will be treated like a natural
language and allowed to grow and flourish without constraint, as do other
natural languages.</P

constitutes the largest community of people using the language, has over
200 subscribers, with well over 20 regular posters as of this writing. The
level of confidence of the language community has already risen to such a
level that there is a Lojban-language-only discussion group, as well as
the general mailing list. Lojban has also been used extensively in
real-time conversation, both electronically (IRC) and face-to-face. Though
the Lojban-speaking community is so widely diffused that the opportunity
for conversation does not arise frequently, the number of Lojbanists who
can sustain a conversation in the language certainly ranges beyond what can
be counted on the fingers of one hand, and is steadily increasing. Lojban
has been proven in communicative use for well over a decade, and the range
and expressivity of the language is being continually explored by the
language community.</P

are working with the language now are actively consulted for their opinions
on how to teach and spread the language. Within a few weeks of work
learning from the materials already written, you will
be able to work with those who have already started. You will be a
significant part of this small but rapidly growing community. You will
receive personal attention to any problems you have with the language
from those leading the effort. If you are truly ambitious and committed to
the language, you are welcome to join in that leadership.</P
><P
>Those with a computer background who learn the language now will be
the leaders in developing the earliest practical computer applications<A
NAME="idx54"

the language. Meanwhile, computer-oriented Lojbanists can also aid in
developing computer-aided instruction tools or converting existing software
to run on new computers.</P
><P
>People not interested in computers will also find Lojban a valuable
language. You may be interested in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis<A
NAME="idx61"
></A
>, and in
the scientific tests to be planned and conducted, or in other
language-related research. You may be interested in Lojban's potential as
an international language, and in the attempts to use the language to reach
across cultural boundaries.</P
><P
>Regardless of your background, you will find learning Lojban to be a
mind-expanding experience. Learning any language other than your native
tongue broadens your perspectives and allows you to transcend the necessarily limited
viewpoints of your native language's culture. Lojban, being simpler to
learn than natural languages, provides this benefit much more quickly than
does the study of other languages. And being quite different from natural languages,
Lojban provides this benefit more directly.</P
><P
>Having learned Lojban, you will find it easier to learn other
languages and to communicate with people from other backgrounds, regardless
of the language studied; the linguistic principles you learn while learning
Lojban are applicable to these languages and the communication problems they entail. The
logical organization embedded in Lojban will aid you in organizing and
clarifying your thoughts. Your new perspective on language,
ambiguity, and communication will allow you to express those thoughts more
clearly, even when you use an ambiguous natural language.</P
><P
>You needn't learn Lojban for any practical purpose, however. Many, if
not most, of those who are learning Lojban are doing so because it is fun.
Learning Lojban is intellectually stimulating, providing human interaction
(a way to meet other people and get to know them) and mental challenge.
Lojban has all the benefits of games designed for entertainment, with the
side benefit of that entertainment developing into a useful skill.</P
><P
>Learning Lojban as an intellectual toy
means that you can get enjoyment from learning Lojban without anywhere near
the effort needed to benefit from studying other languages. While becoming
fluent in Lojban will probably take hundreds of hours over several months,
you can feel some sense of accomplishment in the language after just a
couple of hours of study. You can use Lojban immediately for fun, while
gaining skill with greater experience.</P

publications, and donations from interested supporters.</P
><P
>The Logical Language Group publishes and sells printed materials on Lojban. 
All language definition
information is considered in the public domain, and most Logical Language
Group publications are distributed under a policy which allows
not-for-charge copying and redistribution. Computer versions of many of our
publications are available on-line at no charge. We ask people who receive
our materials by any of these means to let us know,
so that we may better serve you, and donate
liberally, so that we may continue to serve you.</P
><P
>Most materials that we sell require either prior payment, an informal
commitment to pay on your part, or your statement that you cannot afford to
pay for materials (in which case our supplying these materials is at our
discretion). We attempt to flexibly support Lojbanists who have financial
constraints, and will accept reasonable offers of reduced or delayed
payments subject to our financial condition, given your commitment
to actively maintain contact and involvement with the community.
Obviously, the level of your prior and current activity and any commitments

special commitment to support Lojbanists outside the U.S., because so many of the
language goals are dependent on building an international community of
speakers, and because we recognize the difficulties caused by the
international currency market and the relative wealth of nations. We can
accept bank cheques in most currencies and international payment via 
PayPal. We also encourage people to form groups so that they can receive a single copy
of our materials, copying or passing them to others to keep the per-person
costs low. We expect a lower standard of contact and contribution
from overseas Lojbanists when deciding whether to continue sending our
materials at reduced or no charge.</P

>We ask all recipients of our materials to help us financially in any
way you can. The Logical Language Group needs your gifts for support of the
Loglan/Lojban project. Artificial languages are historically not
self-sustaining financially, and have difficulty receiving outside support. The
Logical Language Group, Inc. is prohibited by its bylaws from spending more
than 15% of its expenses for administrative purposes, except by special
agreement with a donor who agrees to cover such added costs in full.</P

of attracting the widest audience possible, we are committed to
distributing as much material as possible using the 'open source' concept for computer software and a
similar policy for printed publications. This policy retains our copyrights
but allows you, with relatively few restrictions, to copy our materials
for your friends.</P

>If you are attempting to learn the language, we will provide as much help
as we can to assist you. We will put you in touch with
Lojbanists who might be interested in studying or communicating with you in
the language. You can also send your writings to us for review, or for
indirect exchange with others. We try to foster research and social
interaction among those who are learning, or who have already learned the
language. We aid such people in organizing, leading, and teaching formal
classes and study groups, and will sponsor affiliated groups in local areas
where non-profit sponsorship can be of benefit. We conduct an
annual celebration of the language and community (July or August), called
'Logfest'<A

>, in conjunction with our annual
business meeting in the Washington DC area. We also expect to support other
local meetings and gatherings as the community grows.</P
><P
>Of course, we also try to publicize the language. Our representatives
can attend meetings to give presentations on the language. We distribute 
informational material, including these
booklets. Through our efforts, and with your help, the community of
Lojbanists is rapidly growing.<A

>For many of these activities, you need to learn the language first.
However, even those who haven't yet had time to learn the language
can assist in recruiting and
contributing ideas to the effort.</P
><P
>Helping to publicize the language, of course, does not take a lot of
time, or necessarily even knowing the language. Talk to friends, relatives
and colleagues. We will gladly provide copies of this brochure on
request. Lojban tends to sell itself; people who learn of it are more often than not
intrigued by it.</P
><P
>Keep in touch with us. We want to know your ideas and opinions on the
language, on our various activities, and on our products. We welcome open
debate on the language, and have even printed and made available
writings that are critical of various aspects of our efforts, when they are
of sufficient general interest. Open debate aids in understanding and
improves the overall quality of the language and of our presentation of it
to the world. Much of the language design is now complete, and the Logical Language
Group is committed to maintaining a stable version of the language. Nonetheless,
we would rather hear criticism now within our
community and either correct our problems or prepare an adequate response,
than do so later when such issues are raised by outsiders.</P

way will Lojban be proven practical, and gain the credibility it needs to
