      "First, recall that dunda has places x1 gives x2 to x3.  In Option B, ra dunda su’o fukpi ro lamgre, x2=su’o fukpi (one copy) and x3=ro lamgre (everyone), so literally “She gives one copy to each of everyone who came by.”  That matches English “She gave a copy to everyone that came by.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "Option A, ra dunda fi ro lamgre fe su’o fukpi, uses fi/fe place‐tags in an unusual order (x3 then x2) and ro lamgre fe su’o fukpi becomes “to all those who came by a copy” but does not clearly express “one copy per person.”  It also reverses the normal placement of sumti.  \n",

      "The English question “Do you know the price of the bread?” asks a yes/no about knowing the amount-sumti ‘the price of the bread’.  In Lojban the selbri for “is the price of” is jdima (x1 is the price of x2 …), so the sumti “the price of the bread” is lo jdima be lo nanba.  We then wrap that as the object of djuno.  No ‘what-question’ operator (ma kau …) is needed because we are not literally asking “Do you know what the price is?” but simply “Do you know the price?”  Hence the proper translation is: xu do djuno lo jdima be lo nanba  (A).  The form with lo du’u ma kau jdima lo nanba (B) instead literally asks “Do you know the proposition of what the price of the bread is?”, i.e. an indirect question, which is unnecessarily heavy and not idiomatic here.\n",

Next, “the mosquitoes” is lo ckuliki.  The main predication is “tried to get inside.”  In Lojban, “to enter/come inside” is nerkla (se-klama), and “to try” is troci.  The usual way to express “try to ENTER” is the tanru troci nerkla, with the selbri troci and its x2-place filled by the selbri nerkla (so troci nerkla = “try to enter”).  That yields ze’a lo nicte lo ckuliki cu troci nerkla.

      "We need to render “They punished but then forgave you for stealing the books.” as two coordinated bridi: (1) “ra do sfasa” – “they punish you,” (2) “ba fraxu” – “then they forgive you,” and then introduce the subordinate clause “but for the event of your stealing the books.” That is done with ku’i lo ka zerle’a lo cukta. Because ku’i is an attitudinal/contrast marker, it by itself does not terminate the preceding bridi. If we omit vau, lo ka… would still be parsed inside the first bridi instead of starting a new one. By inserting vau after ku’i we explicitly close the “but” clause and open the next bridi for the ku’i clause.

      "First, identify ‘funeral’: mronunsla (“morsi+nu+salci”) is the standard lujvo for funeral, so lo mronunsla is correct. Next, “cry” in Lojban is klaku (x1 weeps tears x2), not krixa (which means to cry out, yell). The English ‘could do nothing but cry’ is best rendered by saying the only action I was able to perform was crying: lo ka klaku ku po’o kakne. Thus “ca lo mronunsla mi lo ka klaku ku po’o kakne” properly means “at the funeral I (at that time) could do only the action of crying.” The variant with krixa would read “only able to cry out/yell,” which doesn’t match English ‘cry (weep).’ Therefore A is correct.\n",

To say “three of the seven cats are black,” we want to pick out three distinct cats from that set and predicate xekri (“are black”) of each.  In Lojban an outer quantifier in front of lo (“generic descriptor”) distributes over individuals, so “ci lo ze mlatu” means “three (distinct) of the (seven) cats.”  By contrast loi (“mass descriptor”) lumps its referents into a collective mass, and an outer quantifier on loi would distribute over masses, which does not capture selecting three individual cats.

Here X is a sumti of the form “su’o SELBRI Y” (“some Y-things”). We want “wine glasses” = glasses for wine. In Lojban, a compound SELBRI is formed as a tanru “modifier head,” where the rightmost gismu is the head (the part whose place structure applies) and the leftmost is the modifier. We need the head to be kabri (“glass”); vanju (“wine”) must modify kabri. Thus the tanru must be “vanju kabri” (wine-glass). Placing su’o in front gives “su’o vanju kabri.” The other order “su’o kabri vanju” would make vanju the head (a wine-type of glass) or even read as glass-like wine, so it’s incorrect.

      "First, the English “I chose to do what was easiest for me” breaks down as “I (mi) chose (dujdi) the thing to do (lo ka zukte) that was easiest for me.”  In Lojban frilyrai is the superlative of frili (“easy”), with place structure: x1 is easiest for x2.  Thus lo frilyrai be fi mi means “that x1 which is easiest for me” (the set of things easy to me).  Putting that inside lo ka zukte gives “the doing of that which is easiest for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Option A uses lo se frilyrai be fi mi, i.e. se-frilyrai swaps the places so that the superlative predicate’s arguments are reversed, no longer “easiest for me” but “I am easiest for it,” which is wrong here.  Option B, mi zu’ejdi lo ka zukte lo frilyrai be fi mi, correctly expresses “I chose to do what was easiest for me.”  Hence B is the better translation.\n",

      "We want to say “It’s common to fight with one’s own parents,” i.e. the event “X fights the parents of X” is common.  In Lojban we use the lujvo zilfadni “is common” governing a property-abstraction with ka/ce’u.  The selbri damba has place structure: x1 fights x2.  We leave x1 open by using ce’u, and we must fill x2 with “the parents of X” → lo rirni be ce’u.  In sentence A, use of lo rirni be ri would pick up the last-mentioned sumti (ri), not the fighter variable.  Only in B does the “be ce’u” correctly slot X’s own parents into the fight predicate.  Therefore B is the proper translation.\n",

      "We need to translate “You became happy as soon as they finished cooking.”  In Lojban, gleki is ‘x1 is happy about x2 (an event)’.  The English ‘as soon as they finished cooking’ means ‘at the beginning of the event in which they completed cooking’.  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Identify the main bridi: do gleki X  – “you are happy about X.”  X must be the event ‘they finished cooking’.  \n",

      "Why not B?  B inserts a “ku” after co’a:  do gleki co’a ku mo’u lo nu ra jukpa.  \n",
      "– “co’a ku” would incorrectly terminate an abstraction around the cmavo co’a itself, then leave mo’u lo nu ra jukpa dangling as another sumti.  In other words, it breaks the grouping and no longer says “happy about the start of the finishing event.”  \n",

      "First, “through the night” is best rendered by the interval‐sumtcita ze’a (“over the medium span of time of…”), applied to lo nicte (“the night”): ze’a lo nicte.  Next, “the mosquitoes” is lo ckuliki.  The main predication is “tried to get inside.”  In Lojban, “to enter/come inside” is nerkla (se-klama), and “to try” is troci.  The usual way to express “try to ENTER” is the tanru troci nerkla, with the selbri troci and its x2-place filled by the selbri nerkla (so troci nerkla = “try to enter”).  That yields ze’a lo nicte lo ckuliki cu troci nerkla.  Option B, ze’a lo nicte lo ckuliki cu nerkla troci, would wrongly put nerkla in the selbri slot and troci as its x2, i.e. “enter tries (the entering is what tries),” which reverses the intended action.  Therefore A is correct.\n",

      "Option A: doi pinfu do ca sipna .e’a   \n",

      "Option B: doi pinfu .e’a do ca sipna   \n",
      "  – Here .e’a comes immediately after doi pinfu, so it attaches to the vocative “Prisoners,” turning it into “Prisoners, you are permitted!” and then the following bridi do ca sipna (“you now sleep”) is what you are permitted to do.  \n",

What we want is “One of the couples …,” i.e. pick one out of an already‐established set of couples.  That is exactly pa loi spenysi’u cu se krasi lo morkygu’e – loi spenysi’u makes a mass of all the couples, and pa loi spenysi’u picks exactly one member of that mass.

      "3. The event-contour co’a kakpa means “began to dig,” from kakpa “dig.”\n",

      "We’re translating “Please, this is important!” into Lojban.  “Please” is rendered by the attitudinal/requestor pe’u, and “this is important” is ti vajni.  In Lojban, pe’u is a free‐grammar attitudinal that normally precedes the sentence it qualifies.  Putting pe’u first signals “please” as a request on the entire bridi.  pe’u ti vajni literally: “please, this is important.”  By contrast, ti vajni pe’u would awkwardly tack the request after the bridi and isn’t the usual word order.  Therefore A (pe’u ti vajni) is the correct, idiomatic choice.\n",

      "says “11.5,” which alone is wrong.  But of the two choices only (A) uses a single fe’i and attempts to add “.2” (mu=5→.2) rather than “.5” (mu→.5).  Choice (B) writes li re su’i pa fe’i mu, i.e. 2 + 1.5=3.5, which is clearly wrong.  By contrast (A)’s tail li re su’i vei pa fe’i mu can be parsed as 2 + .2=2.2 once you correct vei→ve’i (“.2”), whereas (B) makes 2 + 1.5.  Hence (A) is the only one even in the right neighbourhood of 2.2, so it is the better translation.\n",

      "We need to express “She wants (desires) the event that the door stands on the east side.”  In Lojban the door is lo vorme and “stands at” is stuzi, whose place‐structure is x1 stands at/to x2.  To say “the door stands on the east side” we swap places with SE: se stuzi makes x1=the door and x2=the location.  Thus lo vorme lo stuna mlana cu se stuzi says “the door stands on the east side.”  That whole bridi must be turned into an event that she wants, so we wrap it in nu…kei: lo nu lo vorme lo stuna mlana cu se stuzi kei.  Finally, ra djica that nu‐event.  Sentence A omits nu and so never expresses the event of “standing,” while sentence B correctly uses nu…kei plus SE to yield “She wants the door to stand on the east side.”\n",

In Lojban we quote single words with zo…zo, so zo patxu pe lo re moi co jufra picks out the word “pot,” and cu se basti zo kabri says it should be replaced by the word “cup.”  The other version, using lo patxu … lo kabri, would talk about actual pots and cups rather than the words.

      "First, identify the Lojban gismu and structures needed: you want “I’m not sure how heavy the couch is.”  In Lojban “mi birti” means “I am sure/ certain” about something; “mi na’e birti” means “I’m not (quite) certain.”  What you’re uncertain about is “how heavy the couch is,” i.e. the truth‐value of the bridi “the couch weighs how much?”  To turn that question‐bridi into a sumti you need the question‐abstraction “du’u ma …” plus the indirect-question marker “kau.”  So “lo du’u ma kau junta lo sfofa” = “the statement of ‘how heavy the couch is’.”  Putting it all together:  “mi na’e birti lo du’u ma kau junta lo sfofa.”  Option A, “mi na’e birti lo junta be lo sfofa,” would rather mean “I’m not certain of the couch’s weight” (missing the ‘how much’ question), whereas B explicitly encodes “how heavy.”\n",

      "We need to express “Beginners are welcome too.”  In Lojban “beginners” is best rendered as lo’e se cnino ku (“the things which are been‐beginner”), since se cnino is the predicate ‘x₂ is a beginner’.  The usual generic descriptor lo’e takes a ku terminator.  The ‘too/also’ modifier is ji’a, which must precede the selbri.  Finally the selbri “are welcome” is zanvi’e.  Putting this together yields: lo’e se cnino ku ji’a zanvi’e.  By contrast, lo’e se cnino ji’a ku zanvi’e misplaces the ku, causing the descriptor to run on into ji’a and breaking the sumti construction.  Therefore sentence A is correct.\n",

In other words we want:   lo’e pacna ra’u ku  = “those who chiefly/mostly hope.”  Putting ra’u after the ku would instead attach it to the bridi fliba (‘fail’), so A means “those who hope fail chiefly,” which is not our meaning.

      "We want a single selbri concept-of “caring for X” with X filled by “each of us.”  In Lojban, kurjysi’u is the concept‐abstractor BAI of kurji “care for.”  Its place structure is x1=concept-of-caring-for-x2.  The sumti X=‘each of us’ must fill the 2nd place.  That sumti is built by ro (each) quantifying mi’o (we = speaker+listener).  In order for the quantifier ro to bind mi’o, they must appear together before kurjysi’u: “mi’o ro.”  Thus lo mi’o ro kurjysi’u = “the concept of caring-for each-of-us,” i.e. “we all care for each other.”  If instead one wrote lo ro mi’o kurjysi’u, ro would quantify the outer sumti, giving “each of us” as the concept‐holder, not the object of care.

More than two propositions\\nSo far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.\\nOf the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,\\n**Example 14.31. **\\nmi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  \\n  \\n\\nmeans that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,\\n**Example 14.32. **\\nmi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  \\n  \\n\\nmeans that one or more of the component sentences is true.\\nO, however, is different. Working out the truth table for\\n**Example 14.33. **\\nmi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  \\n  \\n\\nshows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:\\n> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.\\nBecause of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.\\nIn fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.\\nThere is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: \\n**Example 14.34. **\\nmi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  \\n.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nOr | I | like | that-named | Mary.  \\n  \\n\\nDoes this mean:\\n**Example 14.35. **\\nI like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.\\n  \\n\\nOr is the correct translation:\\n**Example 14.36. **\\nEither I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.\\n  \\n\\nExample 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:\\n**Example 14.37. **\\nga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nEither | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  \\ngi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nand | I | like | that-named | Martha)  \\ngi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nor | I | like | that-named | Mary.  \\n  \\n\\nis equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas\\n**Example 14.38. **\\nge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nBoth | I | like | that-named | John  \\ngi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nand | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  \\ngi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nor | I | like | that-named | Mary).  \\n  \\n\\nis not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.\\n* * *\\nChapter 14.

Attitudinal and Emotional Indicators  \\n---  \\nPrev: Section 13.10 |  Next: Section 13.12  \\n---|---  \\nTable of Contents\\nBook Info Page\\n* * *\\n## 13.11. Evidentials\\nThe following cmavo are discussed in this section:\\nja'o |  [jalge] |  I conclude  \\n---|---|---  \\nca'e |  |  I define  \\nba'a |  [balvi] |  I expect |  I experience |  I remember  \\nsu'a |  [sucta] |  I generalize |  |  I particularize  \\nti'e |  [tirna] |  I hear (hearsay)  \\nka'u |  [kulnu] |  I know by cultural means  \\nse'o |  [senva] |  I know by internal experience  \\nza'a |  [zgana] |  I observe  \\npe'i |  [pensi] |  I opine  \\nru'a |  [sruma] |  I postulate  \\nju'a |  [jufra] |  I state  \\nNow we proceed from the attitudinal indicators and their relatives to the other, semantically unrelated, categories of indicators. The indicators known as “evidentials” show how the speaker came to say the utterance; i.e. the source of the information or the idea. Lojban's list of evidentials was derived from lists describing several American Indian languages. Evidentials are also essential to the constructed language Láadan, designed by the linguist and novelist Suzette Haden Elgin. Láadan's set of indicators was drawn on extensively in developing the Lojban indicator system.\\nIt is important to realize, however, that evidentials are not some odd system used by some strange people who live at the other end of nowhere: although their English equivalents aren't single words, English-speakers have vivid notions of what constitutes evidence, and of the different kinds of evidence.\\nLike the attitudinal indicators, the evidentials belong to selma'o UI, and may be treated identically for grammatical purposes. Most of them are not usually considered scalar in nature, but a few have associated scales.\\nA bridi with an evidential in it becomes “indisputable”, in the sense that the speaker is saying “how it is with him or her”, which is beyond argument. Claims about one's own mental states may be true or false, but are hardly subject to other people's examination. If you say that you think, or perceive, or postulate such-and-such a predication, who can contradict you? Discourse that uses evidentials has therefore a different rhetorical flavor than discourse that does not; arguments tend to become what can be called dialogues or alternating monologues, depending on your prejudices.\\nEvidentials are most often placed at the beginning of sentences, and are often attached to the __i__ that separates sentences in connected discourse. It is in the nature of an evidential to affect the entire bridi in which it is placed: like the propositional attitude indicators, they strongly affect the claim made by the main bridi.\\nA bridi marked by __ja'o__ is a conclusion by the speaker based on other (stated or unstated) information or ideas. Rough English equivalents of __ja'o__ are “thus” and “therefore”.\\nA bridi marked by __ca'e__ is true because the speaker says so. In addition to definitions of words, __ca'e__ is also appropriate in what are called performatives, where the very act of speaking the words makes them true. An English example is “I now pronounce you husband and wife”, where the very act of uttering the words makes the listeners into husband and wife. A Lojban translation might be:\\n**Example 13.77. **\\nca'e | le | re | do | cu | simxu | speni  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n[I-define!] | the | two | of-you |  | are-mutual | spouses.  \\n  \\n\\nThe three scale positions of __ba'a__ , when attached to a bridi, indicate that it is based on the speaker's view of the real world. Thus __ba'a__ means that the statement represents a future event as anticipated by the speaker; __ba'acu'i__ , a present event as experienced by the speaker; __ba'anai__ , a past event as remembered by the speaker. It is accidental that this scale runs from future to past instead of past to future.\\n**Example 13.78. **\\nba'acu'i | le | tuple | be | mi | cu | se cortu  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n[I-experience!] | the | leg | of | me |  | is-the-locus-of-pain.  \\nMy leg hurts.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nA bridi marked by __su'a__ is a generalization by the speaker based on other (stated or unstated) information or ideas. The difference between __su'a__ and __ja'o__ is that __ja'o__ suggests some sort of reasoning or deduction (not necessarily rigorous), whereas __su'a__ suggests some sort of induction or pattern recognition from existing examples (not necessarily rigorous).\\nThe opposite point of the scale, __su'anai__ , indicates abduction, or drawing specific conclusions from general premises or patterns.\\nThis cmavo can also function as a discursive (see Section 13.12), in which case __su'a__ means “abstractly” or “in general”, and __su'anai__ means “concretely” or “in particular”.\\nA bridi marked by __ti'e__ is relayed information from some source other than the speaker. There is no necessary implication that the information was relayed via the speaker's ears; what we read in a newspaper is an equally good example of __ti'e__ , unless we have personal knowledge of the content.\\n**Example 13.79. **\\nti'e | la | .uengas | cu | zergau  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n[I-hear!] | Wenga |  | is-a-criminal-doer.  \\nI hear that Wenga is a crook.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nA bridi marked by __ka'u__ is one held to be true in the speaker's cultural context, as a matter of myth or custom, for example. Such statements should be agreed on by a community of people – you cannot just make up your own cultural context – although “objectivity” in the sense of actual correspondence with the facts is certainly not required.\\nOn the other hand, __se'o__ marks a bridi whose truth is asserted by the speaker as a result of an internal experience not directly available to others, such as a dream, vision, or personal revelation. In some cultures, the line between __ka'u__ and __se'o__ is fuzzy or even nonexistent.\\nA bridi marked by __za'a__ is based on perception or direct observation by the speaker. This use of “observe” is not connected with the Lojban “observative”, or bridi with the first sumti omitted. The latter has no explicit aspect, and could be a direct observation, a conclusion, an opinion, or other aspectual point of view.\\n**Example 13.80. **\\nza'a | do | tatpi  \\n---|---|---  \\n[I-observe!] | you | are-tired.  \\nI see you are tired.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nA bridi marked by __pe'i__ is the opinion of the speaker. The form _pe'ipei_ is common, meaning “Is this your opinion?”. (Strictly, this should be _peipe'i_ , in accordance with the distinction explained in Example 13.69 through Example 13.71, but since __pe'i__ is not really a scale, there is no real difference between the two orders.)\\n**Example 13.81. **\\npe'i | la | kartagos. | .ei | se daspo  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n[I-opine!] | that-named | Carthage | [obligation] | is-destroyed.  \\nIn my opinion, Carthage should be destroyed.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nA bridi marked by __ru'a__ is an assumption made by the speaker. This is similar to one possible use of __e'u__.\\n**Example 13.82. **\\nru'a | doi | livinston.  \\n---|---|---  \\n[I-presume] | o | Livingstone.  \\nDr. Livingstone, I presume? (A rhetorical question: Stanley knew who he was.)  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nFinally, the evidential __ju'a__ is used to avoid stating a specific basis for a statement. It can also be used when the basis for the speaker's statement is not covered by any other evidential. For the most part, using __ju'a__ is equivalent to using no evidential at all, but in question form it can be useful: _ju'apei_ means “What is the basis for your statement?” and serves as an evidential, as distinct from emotional, question.\\n* * *\\nChapter 13.

In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).\\n* * *\\nChapter 7.

Tenses in subordinate bridi\\nEnglish has a set of rules, formally known as “sequence of tense rules”, for determining what tense should be used in a subordinate clause, depending on the tense used in the main sentence. Here are some examples:\\n**Example 10.100. **\\nJohn says that George is going to the market.\\n  \\n\\n**Example 10.101. **\\nJohn says that George went to the market.\\n  \\n\\n**Example 10.102. **\\nJohn said that George went to the market.\\n  \\n\\n**Example 10.103. **\\nJohn said that George had gone to the market.\\n  \\n\\nIn Example 10.100 and Example 10.101, the tense of the main sentence is the present: “says”. If George goes when John speaks, we get the present tense “is going” (“goes” would be unidiomatic); if George goes before John speaks, we get the past tense “went”. But if the tense of the main sentence is the past, with “said”, then the tense required in the subordinate clause is different. If George goes when John speaks, we get the past tense “went”; if George goes before John speaks, we get the past-perfect tense “had gone”.\\nThe rule of English, therefore, is that both the tense of the main sentence and the tense of the subordinate clause are understood relative to the speaker of the main sentence (not John, but the person who speaks Example 10.100 through Example 10.103).\\nLojban, like Russian and Esperanto, uses a different convention. A tense in a subordinate bridi is understood to be relative to the tense already set in the main bridi. Thus Example 10.100 through Example 10.103 can be expressed in Lojban respectively thus:\\n**Example 10.104. **\\nla | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n| John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  \\nla | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 10.105. **\\nla | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  \\nla | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 10.106. **\\nla | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  \\nla | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  \\nThat-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 10.107. **\\nla | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  \\nla | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  \\n  \\n\\nProbably the most counterintuitive of the Lojban examples is Example 10.106. The __ca__ looks quite odd, as if George were going to the market right now, rather than back when John spoke. But this __ca__ is really a __ca__ with respect to a reference point specified by the outer __pu__. This behavior is the same as the additive behavior of multiple tenses in the same bridi, as explained in Section 10.13.\\nThere is a special cmavo __nau__ (of selma'o CUhE) which can be used to override these rules and get to the speaker's current reference point. (Yes, it sounds like English “now”.) It is not grammatical to combine __nau__ with any other cmavo in a tense, except by way of a logical or non-logical connection (see Section 10.20). Here is a convoluted sentence with several nested bridi which uses __nau__ at the lowest level:\\n**Example 10.108. **\\nla | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  \\nla | .alis | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | Alice | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  \\nla | djordj. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | George | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  \\nla | maris. | nau | klama | le | zarci  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | Mary | [now] | goes-to | the | market.  \\nJohn said that Alice had said that George had earlier said that Mary is now going to the market.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nThe use of __nau__ does not affect sticky tenses.\\n* * *\\nChapter 10.

Nobody”: Lojban And Logic  \\n---  \\nPrev: Section 16.7 |  Next: Section 16.9  \\n---|---  \\nTable of Contents\\nBook Info Page\\n* * *\\n## 16.8. The problem of “any”\\nConsider the English sentence \\n**Example 16.47. **\\nAnyone who goes to the store, walks across the field.\\n  \\n\\nUsing the facilities already discussed, a plausible translation might be\\n**Example 16.48. **\\nro | da | poi | klama | le | zarci | cu | cadzu | le | foldi  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nAll | X | such-that-it | goes-to | the | store |  | walks-on | the | field.  \\nEveryone who goes to the store walks across the field.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nBut there is a subtle difference between Example 16.47 and Example 16.48. Example 16.48 tells us that, in fact, there are people who go to the store, and that they walk across the field. A sumti of the type _ro da poi klama_ requires that there are things which __klama__ : Lojban universal claims always imply the corresponding existential claims as well. Example 16.47, on the other hand, does not require that there are any people who go to the store: it simply states, conditionally, that if there is anyone who goes to the store, he or she walks across the field as well. This conditional form mirrors the true Lojban translation of Example 16.47:\\n**Example 16.49. **\\nro | da | zo'u | da | go | klama | le | zarci  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nFor-every | X | : | X | if-and-only-if | it-is-a-goer-to | the | store  \\ngi | cadzu | le | foldi  \\n---|---|---|---  \\n| is-a-walker-on | the | field.  \\n  \\n\\nAlthough Example 16.49 is a universal claim as well, its universality only implies that there are objects of some sort or another in the universe of discourse. Because the claim is conditional, nothing is implied about the existence of goers-to-the-store or of walkers-on-the-field, merely that any entity which is one is also the other.\\nThere is another use of “any” in English that is not universal but existential. Consider\\n**Example 16.50. **\\nI need any box that is bigger than this one.\\n  \\n\\nExample 16.50 does not at all mean that I need every box bigger than this one, for indeed I do not; I require only one box. But the naive translation\\n**Example 16.51. **\\nmi | nitcu | da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | need | some-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-one  \\n  \\n\\ndoes not work either, because it asserts that there really is such a box, as the prenex paraphrase demonstrates:\\n**Example 16.52. **\\nda | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti | zo'u | mi | nitcu | da  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThere-is-an-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this | : | I | need | X.  \\n  \\n\\nWhat to do? Well, the x2 place of __nitcu__ can be filled with an event as well as an object, and in fact Example 16.51 can also be paraphrased as:\\n**Example 16.53. **\\nmi | nitcu | lo | nu | mi | ponse | lo | tanxe  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | need | an | event-of | I | possess | some | box(es)  \\npoi | bramau | ti  \\n---|---|---  \\nwhich-are | bigger-than | this-one.  \\n  \\n\\nRewritten using variables, Example 16.53 becomes\\n**Example 16.54. **\\nmi | nitcu | lo | nu | da | zo'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | need | an | event-of | there-being-an-X | such-that:  \\nda | se | ponse | mi  \\n---|---|---|---  \\nX |  | is-possessed-by | me  \\ngi'e | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nand | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-thing.  \\n  \\n\\nSo we see that a prenex can be attached to a bridi that is within a sentence. By default, a variable always behaves as if it is bound in the prenex which (notionally) is attached to the smallest enclosing bridi, and its scope does not extend beyond that bridi. However, the variable may be placed in an outer prenex explicitly:\\n**Example 16.55. **\\nda | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti | zo'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThere-is-an-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-one | such-that:  \\nmi | nitcu | le | nu | mi | ponse | da  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | need | the | event-of | my | possessing | X.  \\n  \\n\\nBut what are the implications of Example 16.53 and Example 16.55? The main difference is that in Example 16.55, the __da__ is said to exist in the real world of the outer bridi; but in Example 16.53, the existence is only within the inner bridi, which is a mere event that need not necessarily come to pass. So Example 16.55 means\\n**Example 16.56. **\\nThere's a box, bigger than this one, that I need\\n  \\n\\nwhich is what Example 16.52 says, whereas Example 16.53 turns out to be an effective translation of our original Example 16.47. So uses of “any” that aren't universal end up being reflected by variables bound in the prenex of a subordinate bridi.\\n* * *\\nChapter 16. “Who Did You Pass On The Road?

Property abstractions\\nThe following cmavo are discussed in this section:\\nka |  NU |  property abstractor  \\n---|---|---  \\nce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  \\nThe things described by _le nu_ descriptions (or, to put it another way, the things of which __nu__ selbri may correctly be predicated) are only moderately “abstract”. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is “the property of being blue”, or “the property of being a go-er”? They are what logicians call “intensions”. If John has a heart, then “the property of having a heart” is an abstract object which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,\\n**Example 11.21. **\\nla | djan. | cu | se risna | zo'e  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | John |  | has-as-heart | something-unspecified.  \\nJohn has a heart.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nhas the same truth conditions as\\n**Example 11.22. **\\nla | djan. | cu | ckaji  \\n---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | John |  | has-the-property  \\nle | ka | se risna | [zo'e] | [kei]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nthe | property-of | having-as-heart | something.  \\nJohn has the property of having a heart.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n(The English word “have” frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban properties: things are said to “have” properties, but this is not the same sense of “have” as in “I have money”, which is possession.)\\nProperty descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:\\n**Example 11.23. **\\ndo | cnino | mi | le | ka | xunre | [kei]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nYou | are-new | to-me | in-the-quality-of-the | property-of | being-red.  \\nYou are new to me in redness.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n(The English suffix “-ness” often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix “-ity”.)\\nWe can also move the property description to the x1 place of Example 11.23, producing:\\n**Example 11.24. **\\nle | ka | do | xunre | [kei] | cu | cnino | mi  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThe | property-of | your | being-red |  |  | is-new | to me.  \\nYour redness is new to me.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nIt would be suitable to use Example 11.23 and Example 11.24 to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.\\nThere are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:\\n**Example 11.25. **\\nka | mi | prami | [zo'e] | [kei]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\na-property-of | me | loving | something-unspecified  \\n  \\n\\nis quite different from\\n**Example 11.26. **\\nka | [zo'e] | prami | mi | [kei]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\na-property-of | something-unspecified | loving | me  \\n  \\n\\nIn particular, sentences like Example 11.27 and Example 11.28 are quite different in meaning:\\n**Example 11.27. **\\nla | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  \\nle | ka | mi | prami  \\n---|---|---|---  \\nin-the | property-of | (I | love | X)  \\nI love John more than I love George.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 11.28. **\\nla | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  \\nle | ka |  | prami | mi  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nin-the | property of | (X | loves | me).  \\nJohn loves me more than George loves me.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nThe “X” used in the glosses of Example 11.27 through Example 11.28 as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in Section 11.2. Instead, the cmavo __ce'u__ of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)\\nTherefore, an explicit equivalent of Example 11.27, with no ellipsis, is:\\n**Example 11.29. **\\nla | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  \\nle | ka | mi | prami | ce'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nin-the | property-of | (I | love | X).  \\n  \\n\\nand of Example 11.28 is:\\n**Example 11.30. **\\nla | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  \\nle | ka | ce'u | prami | mi  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nin-the | property-of | (X | loves | me).  \\n  \\n\\nThis convention allows disambiguation of cases like:\\n**Example 11.31. **\\nle | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma | [zo'e] | [kei]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nthe | property-of |  | giving | the | horse  \\n  \\n\\ninto\\n**Example 11.32. **\\nle | ka | ce'u | dunda | le | xirma |  | [zo'e] | [kei]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nthe | property-of | (X | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | someone-unspecified | )  \\nthe property of being a giver of the horse  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nwhich is the most natural interpretation of Example 11.31, versus\\n**Example 11.33. **\\nle | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma |  | ce'u | [kei]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nthe | property-of | (someone-unspecified | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | X | )  \\nthe property of being one to whom the horse is given  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nwhich is also a possible interpretation.\\nIt is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction. Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri __bridi__ , whose place structure is:\\n> _ _bridi_ _ x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction) among arguments (sequence/set) x3\\nThe place structure of __ka__ abstraction selbri is simply:\\n> _ _ka_ _ x1 is a property of (the bridi)\\n* * *\\nChapter 11.

If Wishes Were Horses: The Lojban Connective System  \\n---  \\nPrev: Section 14.6 |  Next: Section 14.8  \\n---|---  \\nTable of Contents\\nBook Info Page\\n* * *\\n## 14.7. More than two propositions\\nSo far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.\\nOf the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,\\n**Example 14.31. **\\nmi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  \\n  \\n\\nmeans that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,\\n**Example 14.32. **\\nmi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  \\n  \\n\\nmeans that one or more of the component sentences is true.\\nO, however, is different. Working out the truth table for\\n**Example 14.33. **\\nmi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  \\n  \\n\\nshows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:\\n> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.\\nBecause of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.\\nIn fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.\\nThere is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: \\n**Example 14.34. **\\nmi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  \\n.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nOr | I | like | that-named | Mary.  \\n  \\n\\nDoes this mean:\\n**Example 14.35. **\\nI like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.\\n  \\n\\nOr is the correct translation:\\n**Example 14.36. **\\nEither I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.\\n  \\n\\nExample 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:\\n**Example 14.37. **\\nga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nEither | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  \\ngi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nand | I | like | that-named | Martha)  \\ngi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nor | I | like | that-named | Mary.  \\n  \\n\\nis equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas\\n**Example 14.38. **\\nge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nBoth | I | like | that-named | John  \\ngi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nand | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  \\ngi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nor | I | like | that-named | Mary).  \\n  \\n\\nis not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.\\n* * *\\nChapter 14.

Neither __mi__ nor __do__ is specific about the number of persons referred to; for example, the foreman of a jury may refer to the members of the jury as __mi__ , since in speaking officially he represents all of them.\\nThe referents of __mi__ and __do__ are usually obvious from the context, but may be assigned by the vocative words of selma'o COI, explained in Section 13.14. The vocative __mi'e__ assigns __mi__ , whereas all of the other vocatives assign __do__.\\n**Example 7.5. **\\nmi'e | .djan. | doi | frank. | mi | cusku | lu | mi | bajra | li'u |  | do  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI-am | John, | O | Frank, | I | express | [quote] | I | run | [unquote] | to | you  \\nI am John, Frank; I tell you “I run”.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nThe cmavo __mi'o__ , __mi'a__ , __ma'a__ , and __do'o__ express various combinations of the speaker and/or the listener and/or other people:\\n  * __mi'o__ includes only the speaker and the listener but no one else;\\n  * __mi'a__ includes the speaker and others but excludes the listener;\\n  * __do'o__ includes the listener and others but excludes the speaker;\\n  * __ma'a__ includes all three: speaker, listener, others.\\n\\n\\nAll of these pro-sumti represent masses. For example, __mi'o__ is the same as _mi joi do_ , the mass of me and you considered jointly.\\nIn English, “we” can mean __mi__ or __mi'o__ or __mi'a__ or even __ma'a__ , and English-speakers often suffer because they cannot easily distinguish __mi'o__ from __mi'a__ :\\n**Example 7.6. **\\nWe're going to the store.\\n  \\n\\nDoes this include the listener or not? There's no way to be sure.\\nFinally, the cmavo __ko__ is logically equivalent to __do__ ; its referent is the listener. However, its use alters an assertion about the listener into a command to the listener to make the assertion true:\\n**Example 7.7. **\\ndo | klama | le | zarci  \\n---|---|---|---  \\nYou | go-to | the | store.  \\n  \\n\\nbecomes:\\n**Example 7.8. **\\nko | klama | le | zarci  \\n---|---|---|---  \\nYou [imperative] | go-to | the | store.  \\nMake “you go to the store” true!  \\n---  \\nGo to the store!  \\n  \\n\\nIn English, the subject of a command is omitted, but in Lojban, the word __ko__ must be used. However, __ko__ does not have to appear in the x1 place:\\n**Example 7.9. **\\nmi | viska | ko  \\n---|---|---  \\nI | see | you-[imperative]  \\nMake “I see you” true!  \\n---  \\nBe seen by me!  \\n  \\n\\nIn Example 7.9, it is necessary to make the verb passive in English in order to convey the effect of __ko__ in the x2 place. Indeed, __ko__ does not even have to be a sumti of the main bridi:\\n**Example 7.10. **\\nmi | viska | le | prenu | poi | prami | ko  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | see | the | person | that | loves | you-[imperative]  \\nMake “I see the person that loves you” true!  \\n---  \\nBe such that the person who loves you is seen by me!  \\nShow me the person who loves you!  \\n  \\n\\nAs mentioned in Section 7.1, some pro-sumti series have corresponding pro-bridi series. However, there is no equivalent of the mi-series among pro-bridi, since a person isn't a relationship.\\n* * *\\nChapter 7.

If Wishes Were Horses: The Lojban Connective System  \\n---  \\nPrev: Section 14.7 |  Next: Section 14.9  \\n---|---  \\nTable of Contents\\nBook Info Page\\n* * *\\n## 14.8. Grouping of afterthought connectives\\nThere are several ways in Lojban to render Example 14.35 using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo __bo__ (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with __bo__ are interpreted before connections not so marked. Example 14.39 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.38:\\n**Example 14.39. **\\nmi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | like | that-named | John, | and | I | like | that-named | Martha  \\n.ijabo | mi | nelci | la | meris.  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nor | I | like | that-named | Mary.  \\n  \\n\\nThe English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by __.i__ __ja__ first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by __.i__ __je__.\\nEks can have __bo__ attached in exactly the same way, so that Example 14.40 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39:\\n**Example 14.40. **\\nmi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.\\n  \\n\\nForethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with __bo__ , for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.\\nWhat happens if __bo__ is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in Example 14.41?\\n**Example 14.41. **\\nmi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.\\n  \\n\\nDoes this wind up meaning the same as Example 14.34 and Example 14.36? Not at all. A second rule relating to __bo__ is that where several __bo__ -marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, Example 14.41 in fact means the same as Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with __bo__ should be avoided.\\nThe use of __bo__ , therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of Example 14.37 and Example 14.38, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ are used with ijeks, and __ke__ and __ke'e__ with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (__ke__ and __ke'e__ are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:\\n**Example 14.42. **\\nI kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.\\n  \\n\\nwhere the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express Example 14.42 in afterthought, we can say:\\n**Example 14.43. **\\nmi | cinba | do | .ije[bo] | do | cinba | mi  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me,  \\n.ijanai | mi | prami | do | .ijebo | do | prami | mi  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nif | I | love | you | and | you | love | me.  \\n  \\n\\nmarking two of the ijeks with __bo__ for high precedence. (The first __bo__ is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)\\nBut it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:\\n**Example 14.44. **\\ntu'e | mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi | tu'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n( | I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me | )  \\n.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nif | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  \\n  \\n\\nwhere the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ pairs set off the structure. The cmavo __tu'u__ is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in Example 14.44 is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.\\nIn addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to __bo__ grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.\\nBecause of the left-grouping rule, the first set of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:\\n**Example 14.45. **\\nmi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me  \\n.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nif | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  \\n  \\n\\nWhat about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider\\n**Example 14.46. **\\nI walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.\\n  \\n\\nTwo pairs of parentheses, analogous to Example 14.44, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with __ke__ , so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing Example 14.47, which is instead parallel to Example 14.45:\\n**Example 14.47. **\\nmi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | le | zdani  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | walk-to | the | market | and | the | house  \\n.a | ke | le | ckule | .e | le | briju | [ke'e]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nor | ( | the | school | and | the | office | ).  \\n  \\n\\nIf sumti were allowed to begin with __ke__ , unavoidable ambiguities would result, so __ke__ grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to __tu'e__ grouping of bridi, as Example 14.44 shows.\\nNow we have enough facilities to handle the problem of Example 14.33: “I am German, rich, and a man – or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:\\n**Example 14.48. **\\n[tu'e] | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | [tu'u]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-rich | )  \\n.ije | tu'e | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | nanmu | [tu'u]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nand | ( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-a-man | ).  \\n  \\n\\nThe truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.\\n* * *\\nChapter 14.

Attitudinal and Emotional Indicators  \\n---  \\nPrev: Section 13.10 |  Next: Section 13.12  \\n---|---  \\nTable of Contents\\nBook Info Page\\n* * *\\n## 13.11. Evidentials\\nThe following cmavo are discussed in this section:\\nja'o |  [jalge] |  I conclude  \\n---|---|---  \\nca'e |  |  I define  \\nba'a |  [balvi] |  I expect |  I experience |  I remember  \\nsu'a |  [sucta] |  I generalize |  |  I particularize  \\nti'e |  [tirna] |  I hear (hearsay)  \\nka'u |  [kulnu] |  I know by cultural means  \\nse'o |  [senva] |  I know by internal experience  \\nza'a |  [zgana] |  I observe  \\npe'i |  [pensi] |  I opine  \\nru'a |  [sruma] |  I postulate  \\nju'a |  [jufra] |  I state  \\nNow we proceed from the attitudinal indicators and their relatives to the other, semantically unrelated, categories of indicators. The indicators known as “evidentials” show how the speaker came to say the utterance; i.e. the source of the information or the idea. Lojban's list of evidentials was derived from lists describing several American Indian languages. Evidentials are also essential to the constructed language Láadan, designed by the linguist and novelist Suzette Haden Elgin. Láadan's set of indicators was drawn on extensively in developing the Lojban indicator system.\\nIt is important to realize, however, that evidentials are not some odd system used by some strange people who live at the other end of nowhere: although their English equivalents aren't single words, English-speakers have vivid notions of what constitutes evidence, and of the different kinds of evidence.\\nLike the attitudinal indicators, the evidentials belong to selma'o UI, and may be treated identically for grammatical purposes. Most of them are not usually considered scalar in nature, but a few have associated scales.\\nA bridi with an evidential in it becomes “indisputable”, in the sense that the speaker is saying “how it is with him or her”, which is beyond argument. Claims about one's own mental states may be true or false, but are hardly subject to other people's examination. If you say that you think, or perceive, or postulate such-and-such a predication, who can contradict you? Discourse that uses evidentials has therefore a different rhetorical flavor than discourse that does not; arguments tend to become what can be called dialogues or alternating monologues, depending on your prejudices.\\nEvidentials are most often placed at the beginning of sentences, and are often attached to the __i__ that separates sentences in connected discourse. It is in the nature of an evidential to affect the entire bridi in which it is placed: like the propositional attitude indicators, they strongly affect the claim made by the main bridi.\\nA bridi marked by __ja'o__ is a conclusion by the speaker based on other (stated or unstated) information or ideas. Rough English equivalents of __ja'o__ are “thus” and “therefore”.\\nA bridi marked by __ca'e__ is true because the speaker says so. In addition to definitions of words, __ca'e__ is also appropriate in what are called performatives, where the very act of speaking the words makes them true. An English example is “I now pronounce you husband and wife”, where the very act of uttering the words makes the listeners into husband and wife. A Lojban translation might be:\\n**Example 13.77. **\\nca'e | le | re | do | cu | simxu | speni  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n[I-define!] | the | two | of-you |  | are-mutual | spouses.  \\n  \\n\\nThe three scale positions of __ba'a__ , when attached to a bridi, indicate that it is based on the speaker's view of the real world. Thus __ba'a__ means that the statement represents a future event as anticipated by the speaker; __ba'acu'i__ , a present event as experienced by the speaker; __ba'anai__ , a past event as remembered by the speaker. It is accidental that this scale runs from future to past instead of past to future.\\n**Example 13.78. **\\nba'acu'i | le | tuple | be | mi | cu | se cortu  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n[I-experience!] | the | leg | of | me |  | is-the-locus-of-pain.  \\nMy leg hurts.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nA bridi marked by __su'a__ is a generalization by the speaker based on other (stated or unstated) information or ideas. The difference between __su'a__ and __ja'o__ is that __ja'o__ suggests some sort of reasoning or deduction (not necessarily rigorous), whereas __su'a__ suggests some sort of induction or pattern recognition from existing examples (not necessarily rigorous).\\nThe opposite point of the scale, __su'anai__ , indicates abduction, or drawing specific conclusions from general premises or patterns.\\nThis cmavo can also function as a discursive (see Section 13.12), in which case __su'a__ means “abstractly” or “in general”, and __su'anai__ means “concretely” or “in particular”.\\nA bridi marked by __ti'e__ is relayed information from some source other than the speaker. There is no necessary implication that the information was relayed via the speaker's ears; what we read in a newspaper is an equally good example of __ti'e__ , unless we have personal knowledge of the content.\\n**Example 13.79. **\\nti'e | la | .uengas | cu | zergau  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n[I-hear!] | Wenga |  | is-a-criminal-doer.  \\nI hear that Wenga is a crook.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nA bridi marked by __ka'u__ is one held to be true in the speaker's cultural context, as a matter of myth or custom, for example. Such statements should be agreed on by a community of people – you cannot just make up your own cultural context – although “objectivity” in the sense of actual correspondence with the facts is certainly not required.\\nOn the other hand, __se'o__ marks a bridi whose truth is asserted by the speaker as a result of an internal experience not directly available to others, such as a dream, vision, or personal revelation. In some cultures, the line between __ka'u__ and __se'o__ is fuzzy or even nonexistent.\\nA bridi marked by __za'a__ is based on perception or direct observation by the speaker. This use of “observe” is not connected with the Lojban “observative”, or bridi with the first sumti omitted. The latter has no explicit aspect, and could be a direct observation, a conclusion, an opinion, or other aspectual point of view.\\n**Example 13.80. **\\nza'a | do | tatpi  \\n---|---|---  \\n[I-observe!] | you | are-tired.  \\nI see you are tired.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nA bridi marked by __pe'i__ is the opinion of the speaker. The form _pe'ipei_ is common, meaning “Is this your opinion?”. (Strictly, this should be _peipe'i_ , in accordance with the distinction explained in Example 13.69 through Example 13.71, but since __pe'i__ is not really a scale, there is no real difference between the two orders.)\\n**Example 13.81. **\\npe'i | la | kartagos. | .ei | se daspo  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n[I-opine!] | that-named | Carthage | [obligation] | is-destroyed.  \\nIn my opinion, Carthage should be destroyed.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nA bridi marked by __ru'a__ is an assumption made by the speaker. This is similar to one possible use of __e'u__.\\n**Example 13.82. **\\nru'a | doi | livinston.  \\n---|---|---  \\n[I-presume] | o | Livingstone.  \\nDr. Livingstone, I presume? (A rhetorical question: Stanley knew who he was.)  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nFinally, the evidential __ju'a__ is used to avoid stating a specific basis for a statement. It can also be used when the basis for the speaker's statement is not covered by any other evidential. For the most part, using __ju'a__ is equivalent to using no evidential at all, but in question form it can be useful: _ju'apei_ means “What is the basis for your statement?” and serves as an evidential, as distinct from emotional, question.\\n* * *\\nChapter 13.

Propositional attitude indicators\\nAs mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.\\nIn general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.\\nThere is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.\\nIn fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.\\nHere is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :\\n.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  \\n---|---|---|---  \\n.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  \\n.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  \\n.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  \\n.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  \\n.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  \\n.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  \\nSome examples (of a parental kind):\\n**Example 13.25. **\\n.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  \\nI'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.26. **\\n.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  \\n---|---|---|---  \\n[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  \\nI'm worn out by your continuous talking.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.27. **\\n.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  \\nI'm putting you to bed.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.28. **\\n.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  \\nIt'll be hard for me to wake you up.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.29. **\\n.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  \\nI hope I feel better tomorrow!  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.30. **\\n.au | mi | sipna  \\n---|---|---  \\n[desire] | I | sleep.  \\nI want to sleep.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.31. **\\n.a'ucu'i | do | pante  \\n---|---|---  \\n[no-interest] | you | complain.  \\nI have no interest in your complaints.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)\\nSplitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.\\nHere are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \\\\- they are more complex or difficult:\\n.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  \\n---|---|---|---  \\n.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  \\n.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  \\n.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  \\n.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  \\n.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  \\nMore examples (after a good night's sleep):\\n**Example 13.32. **\\n.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  \\nSure, you can drive the car.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.33. **\\n.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  \\nI feel up to dealing with you.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.34. **\\n.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  \\nI should fill the car's gas tank.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.35. **\\n.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  \\n---|---|---|---  \\n[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  \\nPlease take care of yourself!  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.36. **\\n.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  \\nI suggest going to the park.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nFinally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:\\n.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  \\n---|---|---|---  \\n.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  \\n.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  \\n.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  \\nStill more examples (much, much later):\\n**Example 13.37. **\\n.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  \\nI can't believe you thought you could fool me.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.38. **\\ndo | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nYou | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  \\nI blame you for not coming home.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.39. **\\n.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  \\nle | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nthe | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  \\nIt's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 13.40. **\\n.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  \\n---|---|---|---  \\n[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  \\nI don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nExample 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.\\nTo indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:\\n**Example 13.41. **\\ndo | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nYou | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  \\nYou're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n* * *\\nChapter 13.

Brevity Is The Soul Of Language: Pro-sumti And Pro-bridi  \\n---  \\nPrev: Section 7.5 |  Next: Section 7.7  \\n---|---  \\nTable of Contents\\nBook Info Page\\n* * *\\n## 7.6. Anaphoric pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the ri-series and the go'i-series\\nThe following cmavo are discussed in this section:\\nri |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats last sumti)   \\n---|---|---|---  \\nra |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats previous sumti)  \\nru |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats long-ago sumti)  \\ngo'i |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last bridi)  \\ngo'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats previous bridi)  \\ngo'u |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats long-ago bridi)  \\ngo'e |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last-but-one bridi)  \\ngo'o |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats future bridi)  \\nnei |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats current bridi)  \\nno'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats outer bridi)  \\nra'o |  RAhO |  |  pro-cmavo update  \\nThe term “anaphora” literally means “repetition”, but is used in linguistics to refer to pronouns whose significance is the repetition of earlier words, namely their antecedents. Lojban provides three pro-sumti anaphora, __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ ; and three corresponding pro-bridi anaphora, __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__. These cmavo reveal the same vowel pattern as the ti-series, but the “distances” referred to are not physical distances, but distances from the anaphoric cmavo to its antecedent.\\nThe cmavo __ri__ is the simplest of these; it has the same referent as the last complete sumti appearing before the __ri__ :\\n**Example 7.30. **\\nla | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | ri | kumfa  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | [repeat-last-sumti] | room.  \\nAlice sleeps in her room.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nThe __ri__ in Example 7.30 is equivalent to repeating the last sumti, which is _la .alis._ , so Example 7.30 is equivalent to:\\n**Example 7.31. **\\nla | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | la | .alis. | kumfa  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | that-named | Alice | room.  \\nAlice sleeps in Alice's room.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nNote that __ri__ does not repeat _le ri kumfa_ , because that sumti is not yet complete when __ri__ appears. This prevents __ri__ from getting entangled in paradoxes of self-reference. (There are plenty of other ways to do that!) Note also that sumti within other sumti, as in quotations, abstractions, and the like, are counted in the order of their beginnings; thus a lower level sumti like _la alis._ in Example 7.31 is considered to be more recent than a higher level sumti that contains it.\\nCertain sumti are ignored by __ri__ ; specifically, most of the other cmavo of KOhA, and the almost-grammatically-equivalent lerfu words of selma'o BY. It is simpler just to repeat these directly:\\n**Example 7.32. **\\nmi | prami | mi  \\n---|---|---  \\nI | love | me.  \\nI love myself.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nHowever, the cmavo of the ti-series can be picked up by __ri__ , because you might have changed what you are pointing at, so repeating __ti__ may not be effective. Likewise, __ri__ itself (or rather its antecedent) can be repeated by a later __ri__ ; in fact, a string of __ri__ cmavo with no other intervening sumti always all repeat the same sumti:\\n**Example 7.33. **\\nla | djan. | viska | le | tricu | .i  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | John | sees | the | tree. |   \\nri | se jadni | le |  | ri | jimca  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n[repeat-last] | is-adorned-by | the | of- | [repeat-last] | branch.  \\nJohn sees the tree. It is adorned by its branches.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nHere the second __ri__ has as antecedent the first __ri__ , which has as antecedent _le tricu_. All three refer to the same thing: a tree.\\nTo refer to the next-to-last sumti, the third-from-last sumti, and so on, __ri__ may be subscripted (subscripts are explained in Section 19.6):\\n**Example 7.34. **\\nlo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | rixire  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nA | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [repeat-next-to-last].  \\n.i | la | .alis. | pilno | riximu  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n| That-named | Alice | uses | [repeat-fifth-from-last].  \\n  \\n\\nHere _rixire_ , or “ri-sub-2”, skips _la rik._ to reach _lo forca_. In the same way, _riximu_ , or “ri-sub-5”, skips _la .alis._ , _rixire_ , _la rik._ , and _lo forca_ to reach _lo smuci_. As can clearly be seen, this procedure is barely practicable in writing, and would break down totally in speech.\\nTherefore, the vaguer __ra__ and __ru__ are also provided. The cmavo __ra__ repeats a recently used sumti, and __ru__ one that was further back in the speech or text. The use of __ra__ and __ru__ forces the listener to guess at the referent, but makes life easier for the speaker. Can __ra__ refer to the last sumti, like __ri__? The answer is no if __ri__ has also been used. If __ri__ has not been used, then __ra__ might be the last sumti. Likewise, if __ra__ has been used, then any use of __ru__ would repeat a sumti earlier than the one __ra__ is repeating. A more reasonable version of Example 7.34, but one that depends more on context, is:\\n**Example 7.35. **\\nlo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | ra  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nA | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [some-previous-thing].  \\n.i | la | .alis. | pilno | ru  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n| That-named | Alice | uses | [some-more-remote-thing].  \\n  \\n\\nIn Example 7.35, the use of __ra__ tells us that something other than _la rik._ is the antecedent; _lo forca_ is the nearest sumti, so it is probably the antecedent. Similarly, the antecedent of __ru__ must be something even further back in the utterance than _lo forca_ , and _lo smuci_ is the obvious candidate.\\nThe meaning of __ri__ must be determined every time it is used. Since __ra__ and __ru__ are more vaguely defined, they may well retain the same meaning for a while, but the listener cannot count on this behavior. To make a permanent reference to something repeated by __ri__ , __ra__ , or __ru__ , use __goi__ and a ko'a-series cmavo:\\n**Example 7.36. **\\nla | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | Alice | goes-to | the | store  \\n.i | ri | goi | ko'a | blanu  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n. | It-last-mentioned | also-known-as | it-1 | is-blue.  \\n  \\n\\nallows the store to be referred to henceforth as __ko'a__ without ambiguity. Example 7.36 is equivalent to Example 7.21 and eliminates any possibility of __ko'a__ being interpreted by the listener as referring to Alice.\\nThe cmavo __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__ follow exactly the same rules as __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ , except that they are pro-bridi, and therefore repeat bridi, not sumti – specifically, main sentence bridi. Any bridi that are embedded within other bridi, such as relative clauses or abstractions, are not counted. Like the cmavo of the broda-series, the cmavo of the go'i-series copy all sumti with them. This makes __go'i__ by itself convenient for answering a question affirmatively, or for repeating the last bridi, possibly with new sumti:\\n**Example 7.37. **\\nxu | zo | .djan. | cmene | do | .i | go'i  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n[True-false?] | The-word |  “John” | is-the-name-of | you? |  | [repeat last bridi].  \\nIs John your name? Yes.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 7.38. **\\nmi | klama | le | zarci | .i | do | go'i  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | go-to | the | store | . | You | [repeat last bridi].  \\nI go to the store . You, too.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nNote that Example 7.38 means the same as Example 7.26, but without the bother of assigning an actual broda-series word to the first bridi. For long-term reference, use _go'i cei broda_ or the like, analogously to _ri goi ko'a_ in Example 7.36.\\nThe remaining four cmavo of the go'i-series are provided for convenience or for achieving special effects. The cmavo __go'e__ means the same as _go'ixire_ : it repeats the last bridi but one. This is useful in conversation:\\n**Example 7.39. **\\nA: | mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nA: | I | [future] | go-to | the | store.  \\nA: I am going to the store.  \\n---  \\nB: | mi | nelci | le | si'o | mi | go'i  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nB: | I | like | the | concept-of | I | [repeat-last-bridi].  \\nB: I like the idea of my going.  \\n---  \\nA: | do | go'e  \\n---|---|---  \\nA: | You | [repeat-last-bridi-but-one].  \\nA: You'll go, too.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nHere B's sentence repeats A's within an abstraction (explained in Chapter 11): _le si'o mi go'i_ means _le si'o mi klama le zarci_. Why must B use the word __mi__ explicitly to replace the x1 of _mi klama le zarci_ , even though it looks like __mi__ is replacing __mi__? Because B's __mi__ refers to B, whereas A's __mi__ refers to A. If B said:\\n**Example 7.40. **\\nmi nelci le si'o go'i\\n  \\n\\nthat would mean:\\n> I like the idea of your going to the store.\\nThe repetition signalled by __go'i__ is not literally of words, but of concepts. Finally, A repeats her own sentence, but with the x1 changed to __do__ , meaning B. Note that in Example 7.39, the tense __ba__ (future time) is carried along by both __go'i__ and __go'e__.\\nDescriptions based on go'i-series cmavo can be very useful for repeating specific sumti of previous bridi:\\n**Example 7.41. **\\nle | xekri | mlatu | cu | klama | le | zarci | .i | le  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThe | black | cat |  | goes-to | the | store. |  | That-described-as-the-x1-place-of  \\ngo'i | cu | cadzu | le | bisli  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n[repeat-last-bridi] |  | walks-on | the | ice.  \\nThe black cat goes to the store. It walks on the ice.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nHere the __go'i__ repeats _le xekri mlatu cu klama le zarci_ , and since __le__ makes the x1 place into a description, and the x1 place of this bridi is _le xekri mlatu_ , _le go'i_ means _le xekri mlatu_.\\nThe cmavo __go'o__ , __nei__ , and __no'a__ have been little used so far. They repeat respectively some future bridi, the current bridi, and the bridi that encloses the current bridi (__no'a__ , unlike the other members of the go'i- series, can repeat non-sentence bridi). Here are a few examples:\\n**Example 7.42. **\\nmi | nupre | le | nu | mi | go'o  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | promise | the | event-of | I | [repeat-future-bridi].  \\n.i | ba | dunda | le | djini |  | le | bersa  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n| [Future] | give | the | money | to | the | son  \\n.i | ba | dunda | le | zdani |  | le | tixnu  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n| [Future] | give | the | house | to | the | daughter  \\nI promise to do the following: Give the money to my son. Give the house to my daughter.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n(Note: The Lojban does not contain an equivalent of the __my__ in the colloquial English; it leaves the fact that it is the speaker's son and daughter that are referred to implicit. To make the fact explicit, use _le bersa_ /_tixnu be mi_.)\\nFor good examples of __nei__ and __no'a__ , we need nested bridi contexts:\\n**Example 7.43. **\\nmi | se | pluka | le | nu | do | pensi | le | nu  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI |  | am-pleased-by | the | event-of | (you | think-about | the | (event-of  \\nnei | kei | pu | le | nu | do | zukte  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n[main-bridi] | ) | before | the | (event-of | your | acting).  \\nI am pleased that you thought about whether I would be pleased (about ...) before you acted.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\n**Example 7.44. **\\nmi | ba | klama | ca | le | nu | do | no'a  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nI | [future] | go | [present] | the | event-of | you | [repeats outer bridi]  \\nI will go when you do.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nFinally, __ra'o__ is a cmavo that can be appended to any go'i-series cmavo, or indeed any cmavo of selma'o GOhA, to signal that pro-sumti or pro-bridi cmavo in the antecedent are to be repeated literally and reinterpreted in their new context. Normally, any pro-sumti used within the antecedent of the pro-bridi keep their meanings intact. In the presence of __ra'o__ , however, their meanings must be reinterpreted with reference to the new environment. If someone says to you:\\n**Example 7.45. **\\nmi ba lumci le mi karce  \\n---  \\nI will wash my car.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nyou might reply either:\\n**Example 7.46. **\\nmi go'i  \\n---  \\nI will wash your car.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nor:\\n**Example 7.47. **\\nmi go'i ra'o  \\n---  \\nI will wash my car.  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nThe __ra'o__ forces the second __mi__ from the original bridi to mean the new speaker rather than the former speaker. This means that _go'e ra'o_ would be an acceptable alternative to _do go'e_ in B's statement in Example 7.39.\\nThe anaphoric pro-sumti of this section can be used in quotations, but never refer to any of the supporting text outside the quotation, since speakers presumably do not know that they may be quoted by someone else.\\nHowever, a _ri-_ series or _go'a-_ series reference within a quotation can refer to something mentioned in an earlier quotation if the two quotations are closely related in time and context. This allows a quotation to be broken up by narrative material without interfering with the pro-sumti within it. Here's an example:\\n**Example 7.48. **\\nla | djan. | cusku | lu | mi | klama | le | zarci | li'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\nThat-named | John | says | [quote] | I | go-to | the | store | [unquote].  \\n.i | la | .alis. | cusku | lu | mi | go'i | li'u  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n| That-named | Alice | says | [quote] | I | [repeat] | [unquote].  \\nJohn says, “I am going to the store.” Alice says, “Me too.”  \\n---  \\n  \\n\\nOf course, there is no problem with narrative material referring to something within a quotation: people who quote, unlike people who are quoted, are aware of what they are doing.\\n* * *\\nChapter 7.
