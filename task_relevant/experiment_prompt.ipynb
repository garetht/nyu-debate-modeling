      "First, recall that dunda has places x1 gives x2 to x3.  In Option B, ra dunda su’o fukpi ro lamgre, x2=su’o fukpi (one copy) and x3=ro lamgre (everyone), so literally “She gives one copy to each of everyone who came by.”  That matches English “She gave a copy to everyone that came by.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "Option A, ra dunda fi ro lamgre fe su’o fukpi, uses fi/fe place‐tags in an unusual order (x3 then x2) and ro lamgre fe su’o fukpi becomes “to all those who came by a copy” but does not clearly express “one copy per person.”  It also reverses the normal placement of sumti.  \n",

      "The English question “Do you know the price of the bread?” asks a yes/no about knowing the amount-sumti ‘the price of the bread’.  In Lojban the selbri for “is the price of” is jdima (x1 is the price of x2 …), so the sumti “the price of the bread” is lo jdima be lo nanba.  We then wrap that as the object of djuno.  No ‘what-question’ operator (ma kau …) is needed because we are not literally asking “Do you know what the price is?” but simply “Do you know the price?”  Hence the proper translation is: xu do djuno lo jdima be lo nanba  (A).  The form with lo du’u ma kau jdima lo nanba (B) instead literally asks “Do you know the proposition of what the price of the bread is?”, i.e. an indirect question, which is unnecessarily heavy and not idiomatic here.\n",

Next, “the mosquitoes” is lo ckuliki.  The main predication is “tried to get inside.”  In Lojban, “to enter/come inside” is nerkla (se-klama), and “to try” is troci.  The usual way to express “try to ENTER” is the tanru troci nerkla, with the selbri troci and its x2-place filled by the selbri nerkla (so troci nerkla = “try to enter”).  That yields ze’a lo nicte lo ckuliki cu troci nerkla.

      "We need to render “They punished but then forgave you for stealing the books.” as two coordinated bridi: (1) “ra do sfasa” – “they punish you,” (2) “ba fraxu” – “then they forgive you,” and then introduce the subordinate clause “but for the event of your stealing the books.” That is done with ku’i lo ka zerle’a lo cukta. Because ku’i is an attitudinal/contrast marker, it by itself does not terminate the preceding bridi. If we omit vau, lo ka… would still be parsed inside the first bridi instead of starting a new one. By inserting vau after ku’i we explicitly close the “but” clause and open the next bridi for the ku’i clause.

      "First, identify ‘funeral’: mronunsla (“morsi+nu+salci”) is the standard lujvo for funeral, so lo mronunsla is correct. Next, “cry” in Lojban is klaku (x1 weeps tears x2), not krixa (which means to cry out, yell). The English ‘could do nothing but cry’ is best rendered by saying the only action I was able to perform was crying: lo ka klaku ku po’o kakne. Thus “ca lo mronunsla mi lo ka klaku ku po’o kakne” properly means “at the funeral I (at that time) could do only the action of crying.” The variant with krixa would read “only able to cry out/yell,” which doesn’t match English ‘cry (weep).’ Therefore A is correct.\n",

To say “three of the seven cats are black,” we want to pick out three distinct cats from that set and predicate xekri (“are black”) of each.  In Lojban an outer quantifier in front of lo (“generic descriptor”) distributes over individuals, so “ci lo ze mlatu” means “three (distinct) of the (seven) cats.”  By contrast loi (“mass descriptor”) lumps its referents into a collective mass, and an outer quantifier on loi would distribute over masses, which does not capture selecting three individual cats.

Here X is a sumti of the form “su’o SELBRI Y” (“some Y-things”). We want “wine glasses” = glasses for wine. In Lojban, a compound SELBRI is formed as a tanru “modifier head,” where the rightmost gismu is the head (the part whose place structure applies) and the leftmost is the modifier. We need the head to be kabri (“glass”); vanju (“wine”) must modify kabri. Thus the tanru must be “vanju kabri” (wine-glass). Placing su’o in front gives “su’o vanju kabri.” The other order “su’o kabri vanju” would make vanju the head (a wine-type of glass) or even read as glass-like wine, so it’s incorrect.

      "First, the English “I chose to do what was easiest for me” breaks down as “I (mi) chose (dujdi) the thing to do (lo ka zukte) that was easiest for me.”  In Lojban frilyrai is the superlative of frili (“easy”), with place structure: x1 is easiest for x2.  Thus lo frilyrai be fi mi means “that x1 which is easiest for me” (the set of things easy to me).  Putting that inside lo ka zukte gives “the doing of that which is easiest for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Option A uses lo se frilyrai be fi mi, i.e. se-frilyrai swaps the places so that the superlative predicate’s arguments are reversed, no longer “easiest for me” but “I am easiest for it,” which is wrong here.  Option B, mi zu’ejdi lo ka zukte lo frilyrai be fi mi, correctly expresses “I chose to do what was easiest for me.”  Hence B is the better translation.\n",

      "We want to say “It’s common to fight with one’s own parents,” i.e. the event “X fights the parents of X” is common.  In Lojban we use the lujvo zilfadni “is common” governing a property-abstraction with ka/ce’u.  The selbri damba has place structure: x1 fights x2.  We leave x1 open by using ce’u, and we must fill x2 with “the parents of X” → lo rirni be ce’u.  In sentence A, use of lo rirni be ri would pick up the last-mentioned sumti (ri), not the fighter variable.  Only in B does the “be ce’u” correctly slot X’s own parents into the fight predicate.  Therefore B is the proper translation.\n",

Option A, lo .ekcala be lo nazbi, would mean “the clown of the nose,” i.e. swapping possessor and possessed.  Therefore the correct translation is option B.\n",

      "We need to translate “You became happy as soon as they finished cooking.”  In Lojban, gleki is ‘x1 is happy about x2 (an event)’.  The English ‘as soon as they finished cooking’ means ‘at the beginning of the event in which they completed cooking’.  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Identify the main bridi: do gleki X  – “you are happy about X.”  X must be the event ‘they finished cooking’.  \n",

      "Why not B?  B inserts a “ku” after co’a:  do gleki co’a ku mo’u lo nu ra jukpa.  \n",
      "– “co’a ku” would incorrectly terminate an abstraction around the cmavo co’a itself, then leave mo’u lo nu ra jukpa dangling as another sumti.  In other words, it breaks the grouping and no longer says “happy about the start of the finishing event.”  \n",

      "First, “through the night” is best rendered by the interval‐sumtcita ze’a (“over the medium span of time of…”), applied to lo nicte (“the night”): ze’a lo nicte.  Next, “the mosquitoes” is lo ckuliki.  The main predication is “tried to get inside.”  In Lojban, “to enter/come inside” is nerkla (se-klama), and “to try” is troci.  The usual way to express “try to ENTER” is the tanru troci nerkla, with the selbri troci and its x2-place filled by the selbri nerkla (so troci nerkla = “try to enter”).  That yields ze’a lo nicte lo ckuliki cu troci nerkla.  Option B, ze’a lo nicte lo ckuliki cu nerkla troci, would wrongly put nerkla in the selbri slot and troci as its x2, i.e. “enter tries (the entering is what tries),” which reverses the intended action.  Therefore A is correct.\n",

      "Option B: doi pinfu .e’a do ca sipna   \n",
      "  – Here .e’a comes immediately after doi pinfu, so it attaches to the vocative “Prisoners,” turning it into “Prisoners, you are permitted!” and then the following bridi do ca sipna (“you now sleep”) is what you are permitted to do.  \n",

What we want is “One of the couples …,” i.e. pick one out of an already‐established set of couples.  That is exactly pa loi spenysi’u cu se krasi lo morkygu’e – loi spenysi’u makes a mass of all the couples, and pa loi spenysi’u picks exactly one member of that mass.

      "We’re translating “Please, this is important!” into Lojban.  “Please” is rendered by the attitudinal/requestor pe’u, and “this is important” is ti vajni.  In Lojban, pe’u is a free‐grammar attitudinal that normally precedes the sentence it qualifies.  Putting pe’u first signals “please” as a request on the entire bridi.  pe’u ti vajni literally: “please, this is important.”  By contrast, ti vajni pe’u would awkwardly tack the request after the bridi and isn’t the usual word order.  Therefore A (pe’u ti vajni) is the correct, idiomatic choice.\n",

      "says “11.5,” which alone is wrong.  But of the two choices only (A) uses a single fe’i and attempts to add “.2” (mu=5→.2) rather than “.5” (mu→.5).  Choice (B) writes li re su’i pa fe’i mu, i.e. 2 + 1.5=3.5, which is clearly wrong.  By contrast (A)’s tail li re su’i vei pa fe’i mu can be parsed as 2 + .2=2.2 once you correct vei→ve’i (“.2”), whereas (B) makes 2 + 1.5.  Hence (A) is the only one even in the right neighbourhood of 2.2, so it is the better translation.\n",

      "We need to express “She wants (desires) the event that the door stands on the east side.”  In Lojban the door is lo vorme and “stands at” is stuzi, whose place‐structure is x1 stands at/to x2.  To say “the door stands on the east side” we swap places with SE: se stuzi makes x1=the door and x2=the location.  Thus lo vorme lo stuna mlana cu se stuzi says “the door stands on the east side.”  That whole bridi must be turned into an event that she wants, so we wrap it in nu…kei: lo nu lo vorme lo stuna mlana cu se stuzi kei.  Finally, ra djica that nu‐event.  Sentence A omits nu and so never expresses the event of “standing,” while sentence B correctly uses nu…kei plus SE to yield “She wants the door to stand on the east side.”\n",

In Lojban we quote single words with zo…zo, so zo patxu pe lo re moi co jufra picks out the word “pot,” and cu se basti zo kabri says it should be replaced by the word “cup.”  The other version, using lo patxu … lo kabri, would talk about actual pots and cups rather than the words.

      "We need to express “Beginners are welcome too.”  In Lojban “beginners” is best rendered as lo’e se cnino ku (“the things which are been‐beginner”), since se cnino is the predicate ‘x₂ is a beginner’.  The usual generic descriptor lo’e takes a ku terminator.  The ‘too/also’ modifier is ji’a, which must precede the selbri.  Finally the selbri “are welcome” is zanvi’e.  Putting this together yields: lo’e se cnino ku ji’a zanvi’e.  By contrast, lo’e se cnino ji’a ku zanvi’e misplaces the ku, causing the descriptor to run on into ji’a and breaking the sumti construction.  Therefore sentence A is correct.\n",

In other words we want:   lo’e pacna ra’u ku  = “those who chiefly/mostly hope.”  Putting ra’u after the ku would instead attach it to the bridi fliba (‘fail’), so A means “those who hope fail chiefly,” which is not our meaning.

      "We want a single selbri concept-of “caring for X” with X filled by “each of us.”  In Lojban, kurjysi’u is the concept‐abstractor BAI of kurji “care for.”  Its place structure is x1=concept-of-caring-for-x2.  The sumti X=‘each of us’ must fill the 2nd place.  That sumti is built by ro (each) quantifying mi’o (we = speaker+listener).  In order for the quantifier ro to bind mi’o, they must appear together before kurjysi’u: “mi’o ro.”  Thus lo mi’o ro kurjysi’u = “the concept of caring-for each-of-us,” i.e. “we all care for each other.”  If instead one wrote lo ro mi’o kurjysi’u, ro would quantify the outer sumti, giving “each of us” as the concept‐holder, not the object of care.
