## 7.2. Personal pro-sumti: the mi-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
mi |  KOhA |  mi-series |  I, me   
---|---|---|---  
do |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you  
mi'o |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and I  
mi'a |  KOhA |  mi-series |  I and others, we but not you  
ma'a |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and I and others  
do'o |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and others  
ko |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you-imperative  
The mi-series of pro-sumti refer to the speaker, the listener, and others in various combinations. __mi__ refers to the speaker and perhaps others for whom the speaker speaks; it may be a Lojbanic mass. __do__ refers to the listener or listeners. Neither __mi__ nor __do__ is specific about the number of persons referred to; for example, the foreman of a jury may refer to the members of the jury as __mi__ , since in speaking officially he represents all of them.
The referents of __mi__ and __do__ are usually obvious from the context, but may be assigned by the vocative words of selma'o COI, explained in Section 13.14. The vocative __mi'e__ assigns __mi__ , whereas all of the other vocatives assign __do__.
**Example 7.5. **
mi'e | .djan. | doi | frank. | mi | cusku | lu | mi | bajra | li'u |  | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I-am | John, | O | Frank, | I | express | [quote] | I | run | [unquote] | to | you  
I am John, Frank; I tell you “I run”.  
---  
  

The cmavo __mi'o__ , __mi'a__ , __ma'a__ , and __do'o__ express various combinations of the speaker and/or the listener and/or other people:
  * __mi'o__ includes only the speaker and the listener but no one else;
  * __mi'a__ includes the speaker and others but excludes the listener;
  * __do'o__ includes the listener and others but excludes the speaker;
  * __ma'a__ includes all three: speaker, listener, others.


All of these pro-sumti represent masses. For example, __mi'o__ is the same as _mi joi do_ , the mass of me and you considered jointly.
In English, “we” can mean __mi__ or __mi'o__ or __mi'a__ or even __ma'a__ , and English-speakers often suffer because they cannot easily distinguish __mi'o__ from __mi'a__ :
**Example 7.6. **
We're going to the store.
  

Does this include the listener or not? There's no way to be sure.
Finally, the cmavo __ko__ is logically equivalent to __do__ ; its referent is the listener. However, its use alters an assertion about the listener into a command to the listener to make the assertion true:
**Example 7.7. **
do | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
You | go-to | the | store.  
  

becomes:
**Example 7.8. **
ko | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
You [imperative] | go-to | the | store.  
Make “you go to the store” true!  
---  
Go to the store!  
  

In English, the subject of a command is omitted, but in Lojban, the word __ko__ must be used. However, __ko__ does not have to appear in the x1 place:
**Example 7.9. **
mi | viska | ko  
---|---|---  
I | see | you-[imperative]  
Make “I see you” true!  
---  
Be seen by me!  
  

In Example 7.9, it is necessary to make the verb passive in English in order to convey the effect of __ko__ in the x2 place. Indeed, __ko__ does not even have to be a sumti of the main bridi:
**Example 7.10. **
mi | viska | le | prenu | poi | prami | ko  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | person | that | loves | you-[imperative]  
Make “I see the person that loves you” true!  
---  
Be such that the person who loves you is seen by me!  
Show me the person who loves you!  
  

As mentioned in Section 7.1, some pro-sumti series have corresponding pro-bridi series. However, there is no equivalent of the mi-series among pro-bridi, since a person isn't a relationship.

## 9.16. CV'V cmavo of selma'o BAI with irregular forms
There are 65 cmavo of selma'o BAI, of which all but one (__do'e__ , discussed in Section 9.6), are derived directly from selected gismu. Of these 64 cmavo, 36 are entirely regular and have the form CV'V, where C is the first consonant of the corresponding gismu, and the Vs are the two vowels of the gismu. The remaining BAI cmavo, which are irregular in one way or another, are listed in the table below. The table is divided into sub-tables according to the nature of the exception; some cmavo appear in more than one sub-table, and are so noted.
**Table 9.1. Monosyllables of the form CVV**

## 11.9. Minor abstraction types
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
li'i |  NU |  experience abstractor  
---|---|---  
si'o |  NU |  concept abstractor  
su'u |  NU |  general abstractor  
There are three more abstractors in Lojban, all of them little used so far. The abstractor __li'i__ expresses experience:
**Example 11.58. **
mi | morji | le | li'i | mi | verba  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | remember | the | experience-of | (my | being-a-child)  
  

The abstractor __si'o__ expresses a mental image, a concept, an idea:
**Example 11.59. **
mi | nelci | le | si'o | la | lojban. | cu | mulno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | enjoy | the | concept-of | that-named | Lojban |  | being-complete.  
  

Finally, the abstractor __su'u__ is a vague abstractor, whose meaning must be grasped from context:
**Example 11.60. **
ko | zgana | le | su'u | le | ci | smacu | cu | bajra  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
you [imperative] | observe | the | abstract-nature-of | the | three | mice |  | running  
See how the three mice run!  
---  
  

All three of these abstractors have an x2 place. An experience requires an experiencer, so the place structure of __li'i__ is:
> _ _li'i_ _ x1 is the experience of (the bridi) as experienced by x2
Similarly, an idea requires a mind to hold it, so the place structure of __si'o__ is:
> _ _si'o_ _ x1 is the idea/concept of (the bridi) in the mind of x2
Finally, there needs to be some way of specifying just what sort of abstraction __su'u__ is representing, so its place structure is:
> _ _su'u_ _ x1 is an abstract nature of (the bridi) of type x2
The x2 place of __su'u__ allows it to serve as a substitute for any of the other abstractors, or as a template for creating new ones. For example,
**Example 11.61. **
le | nu | mi | klama  
---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | my | going  
  

can be paraphrased as
**Example 11.62. **
le | su'u | mi | klama | kei | be | lo | fasnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | abstract-nature-of | (my | going) |  | of-type | an | event  
  

and there is a book whose title might be rendered in Lojban as:
**Example 11.63. **
le | su'u | la | .iecuas.  
---|---|---|---  
the | abstract-nature-of | (that-named | Jesus  
kuctai | selcatra | kei  
---|---|---  
is-an-intersect-shape | type-of-killed-one | )  
be | lo | sa'ordzifa'a  
---|---|---  
of-type | a | slope-low-direction  
ke | nalmatma'e | sutyterjvi  
---|---|---  
type-of | non-motor-vehicle | speed-competition  
The Crucifixion of Jesus Considered As A Downhill Bicycle Race  
---  
  

Note the importance of using __kei__ after __su'u__ when the x2 of __su'u__ (or any other abstractor) is being specified; otherwise, the _be lo_ ends up inside the abstraction bridi.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 7.2. Personal pro-sumti: the mi-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
mi |  KOhA |  mi-series |  I, me   
---|---|---|---  
do |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you  
mi'o |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and I  
mi'a |  KOhA |  mi-series |  I and others, we but not you  
ma'a |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and I and others  
do'o |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and others  
ko |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you-imperative  
The mi-series of pro-sumti refer to the speaker, the listener, and others in various combinations. __mi__ refers to the speaker and perhaps others for whom the speaker speaks; it may be a Lojbanic mass. __do__ refers to the listener or listeners. Neither __mi__ nor __do__ is specific about the number of persons referred to; for example, the foreman of a jury may refer to the members of the jury as __mi__ , since in speaking officially he represents all of them.
The referents of __mi__ and __do__ are usually obvious from the context, but may be assigned by the vocative words of selma'o COI, explained in Section 13.14. The vocative __mi'e__ assigns __mi__ , whereas all of the other vocatives assign __do__.
**Example 7.5. **
mi'e | .djan. | doi | frank. | mi | cusku | lu | mi | bajra | li'u |  | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I-am | John, | O | Frank, | I | express | [quote] | I | run | [unquote] | to | you  
I am John, Frank; I tell you “I run”.  
---  
  

The cmavo __mi'o__ , __mi'a__ , __ma'a__ , and __do'o__ express various combinations of the speaker and/or the listener and/or other people:
  * __mi'o__ includes only the speaker and the listener but no one else;
  * __mi'a__ includes the speaker and others but excludes the listener;
  * __do'o__ includes the listener and others but excludes the speaker;
  * __ma'a__ includes all three: speaker, listener, others.


All of these pro-sumti represent masses. For example, __mi'o__ is the same as _mi joi do_ , the mass of me and you considered jointly.
In English, “we” can mean __mi__ or __mi'o__ or __mi'a__ or even __ma'a__ , and English-speakers often suffer because they cannot easily distinguish __mi'o__ from __mi'a__ :
**Example 7.6. **
We're going to the store.
  

Does this include the listener or not? There's no way to be sure.
Finally, the cmavo __ko__ is logically equivalent to __do__ ; its referent is the listener. However, its use alters an assertion about the listener into a command to the listener to make the assertion true:
**Example 7.7. **
do | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
You | go-to | the | store.  
  

becomes:
**Example 7.8. **
ko | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
You [imperative] | go-to | the | store.  
Make “you go to the store” true!  
---  
Go to the store!  
  

In English, the subject of a command is omitted, but in Lojban, the word __ko__ must be used. However, __ko__ does not have to appear in the x1 place:
**Example 7.9. **
mi | viska | ko  
---|---|---  
I | see | you-[imperative]  
Make “I see you” true!  
---  
Be seen by me!  
  

In Example 7.9, it is necessary to make the verb passive in English in order to convey the effect of __ko__ in the x2 place. Indeed, __ko__ does not even have to be a sumti of the main bridi:
**Example 7.10. **
mi | viska | le | prenu | poi | prami | ko  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | person | that | loves | you-[imperative]  
Make “I see the person that loves you” true!  
---  
Be such that the person who loves you is seen by me!  
Show me the person who loves you!  
  

As mentioned in Section 7.1, some pro-sumti series have corresponding pro-bridi series. However, there is no equivalent of the mi-series among pro-bridi, since a person isn't a relationship.
