## 6.8. Indefinite descriptions
By a quirk of Lojban syntax, it is possible to omit the descriptor __lo__ , but never any other descriptor, from a description like that of Example 6.42; namely, one which has an explicit outer quantifier but no explicit inner quantifier. The following example:
**Example 6.44. **
ci | gerku | [ku] | cu | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---  
Three-of-those-which-are | dogs |  |  | are-white.  
Three dogs are white.  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 6.42. Even though the descriptor is not present, the elidable terminator __ku__ may still be used. The name “indefinite description” for this syntactic form is historically based: of course, it is no more and no less indefinite than its counterpart with an explicit __lo__. Indefinite descriptions were introduced into the language in order to imitate the syntax of English and other natural languages.
Indefinite descriptions must fit this mold exactly: there is no way to make one which does not have an explicit outer quantifier (thus _*gerku cu blabi_ is ungrammatical), or which has an explicit inner quantifier (thus _*reboi ci gerku cu blabi_ is also ungrammatical – _re ci gerku cu blabi_ is fine, but means “23 dogs are white”).
Note: Example 6.32 also contains an indefinite description, namely _su'o ci cutci_ ; another version of that example using an explicit __lo__ would be:
**Example 6.45. **
mi | ponse | su'o | ci | lo | cutci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | at-least | three | things-which-really-are | shoes  
I own three (or more) shoes.

## 7.3. Demonstrative pro-sumti: the ti-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ti |  KOhA |  ti-series |  this here, a nearby object   
---|---|---|---  
ta |  KOhA |  ti-series |  that there, a medium-distant object  
tu |  KOhA |  ti-series |  that yonder, a far-distant object  
It is often useful to refer to things by pointing to them or by some related non-linguistic mechanism. In English, the words “this” and “that” serve this function among others: “this” refers to something pointed at that is near the speaker, and “that” refers to something further away. The Lojban pro-sumti of the ti-series serve the same functions, but more narrowly. The cmavo __ti__ , __ta__ , and __tu__ provide only the pointing function of “this” and “that”; they are not used to refer to things that cannot be pointed at.
There are three pro-sumti of the ti-series rather than just two because it is often useful to distinguish between objects that are at more than two different distances. Japanese, among other languages, regularly does this. Until the 16th century, English did too; the pronoun “that” referred to something at a medium distance from the speaker, and the now-archaic pronoun “yon” to something far away.
In conversation, there is a special rule about __ta__ and __tu__ that is often helpful in interpreting them. When used contrastingly, __ta__ refers to something that is near the listener, whereas __tu__ refers to something far from both speaker and listener. This makes for a parallelism between __ti__ and __mi__ , and __ta__ and __do__ , that is convenient when pointing is not possible; for example, when talking by telephone. In written text, on the other hand, the meaning of the ti-series is inherently vague; is the writer to be taken as pointing to something, and if so, to what? In all cases, what counts as “near” and “far away” is relative to the current situation.
It is important to distinguish between the English pronoun “this” and the English adjective “this” as in “this boat”. The latter is not represented in Lojban by __ti__ :
**Example 7.11. **
le | ti | bloti  
---|---|---  
the | this | boat  
  

does not mean “this boat” but rather “this one's boat”, “the boat associated with this thing”, as explained in Section 8.7. A correct Lojban translation of Example 7.11 is
**Example 7.12. **
le | vi | bloti  
---|---|---  
the | here | boat  
the nearby boat  
---  
  

using a spatial tense before the selbri __bloti__ to express that the boat is near the speaker. (Tenses are explained in full in Chapter 10.) Another correct translation would be:
**Example 7.13. **
ti | noi | bloti  
---|---|---  
this-thing | which-incidentally | is-a-boat  
  

There are no demonstrative pro-bridi to correspond to the ti-series: you can't point to a relationship.

## 2.7. Varying the order of sumti
For one reason or another you may want to change the order, placing one particular sumti at the front of the bridi. The cmavo __se__ , when placed before the last word of the selbri, will switch the meanings of the first and second sumti places. So
**Example 2.21. **
mi |  tavla |  do |  ti  
---|---|---|---  
I talk to you about this.  
---  
  

has the same meaning as
**Example 2.22. **
do |  se tavla |  mi |  ti  
---|---|---|---  
You are talked to by me about this.  
---  
  

The cmavo __te__ , when used in the same location, switches the meanings of the first and the third sumti places.
**Example 2.23. **
mi |  tavla |  do |  ti  
---|---|---|---  
I talk to you about this.  
---  
  

has the same meaning as
**Example 2.24. **
ti |  te tavla |  do |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This is talked about to you by me.  
---  
  

Note that only the first and third sumti have switched places; the second sumti has remained in the second place.
The cmavo __ve__ and __xe__ switch the first and fourth sumti places, and the first and fifth sumti places, respectively. These changes in the order of places are known as “conversions”, and the __se__ , __te__ , __ve__ , and __xe__ cmavo are said to convert the selbri.
More than one of these operators may be used on a given selbri at one time, and in such a case they are evaluated from left to right. However, in practice they are used one at a time, as there are better tools for complex manipulation of the sumti places. See Section 9.4 for details.
The effect is similar to what in English is called the “passive voice”. In Lojban, the converted selbri has a new place structure that is renumbered to reflect the place reversal, thus having effects when such a conversion is used in combination with other constructs such as _le selbri [ku]_ (see Section 2.10).

## 8.4. Multiple relative clauses: _zi'e_
zi'e |  ZIhE |  relative clause joiner  
---|---|---  
Sometimes it is necessary or useful to attach more than one relative clause to a sumti. This is made possible in Lojban by the cmavo __zi'e__ (of selma'o ZIhE), which is used to join one or more relative clauses together into a single unit, thus making them apply to the same sumti. For example:
**Example 8.38. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | zi'e | poi | batci | le | nanmu | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The dog which is white and which bites the man goes.  
---  
  

The most usual translation of __zi'e__ in English is “and”, but __zi'e__ is not really a logical connective: unlike most of the true logical connectives (which are explained in Chapter 14), it cannot be converted into a logical connection between sentences.
It is perfectly correct to use __zi'e__ to connect relative clauses of different kinds:
**Example 8.39. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | zi'e | noi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | that-is | (white) | and | incidentally-such-that  
le | mi | pendo | cu | ponse | ke'a | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(- | my | friend |  | owns | IT | ) | goes.  
The dog that is white, which my friend owns, is going.  
---  
  

In Example 8.39, the restrictive clause _poi blabi_ specifies which dog is referred to, but the incidental clause _noi le mi pendo cu ponse_ is mere incidental information: the listener is supposed to already have identified the dog from the _poi blabi_. Of course, the meaning (though not necessarily the emphasis) is the same if the incidental clause appears first.
It is also possible to connect relative phrases with __zi'e__ , or a relative phrase with a relative clause:
**Example 8.40. **
le | botpi | po | mi | zi'e | poi | blanu | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | bottle | specific-to | me | and | which-is | blue |  | is-broken.  
My blue bottle is broken.  
---  
  

Note that if the colloquial translation of Example 8.40 were “My bottle, which is blue, is broken”, then __noi__ rather than __poi__ would have been correct in the Lojban version, since that version of the English implies that you do not need to know the bottle is blue. As written, Example 8.40 suggests that I probably have more than one bottle, and the one in question needs to be picked out as the blue one.
**Example 8.41. **
mi | ba | zutse | le | stizu | pe  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | sit-in | the | chair | associated-with  
mi | zi'e | po | do | zi'e | poi | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
me | and | specific-to | you | and | which | is-red.  
I will sit in my chair (really yours), the red one.  
---  
  

Example 8.41 illustrates that more than two relative phrases or clauses can be connected with __zi'e__. It almost defies colloquial translation because of the very un-English contrast between _pe mi_ , implying that the chair is temporarily connected with me, and _po do_ , implying that the chair has a more permanent association with you. (Perhaps I am a guest in your house, in which case the chair would naturally be your property.)
Here is another example, mixing a relative phrase and two relative clauses, a restrictive one and a non-restrictive one:
**Example 8.42. **
mi | ba | citka | le | dembi | pe | mi | zi'e | poi | cpana  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | eat | the | beans | associated-with | me | and | which | are-upon  
le | mi | palta | zi'e | noi | do | dunda | ke'a |  | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| my | plate | and | which-incidentally | you | gave | IT | to | me.  
I'll eat my beans that are on my plate, the ones you gave me.

## 8.3. Relative phrases
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
pe |  GOI |  restrictive association  
---|---|---  
po |  GOI |  restrictive possession  
po'e |  GOI |  restrictive intrinsic possession  
po'u |  GOI |  restrictive identification  
ne |  GOI |  incidental association  
no'u |  GOI |  incidental identification  
ge'u |  GEhU |  relative phrase terminator  
There are types of relative clauses (those which have a certain selbri) which are frequently wanted in Lojban, and can be expressed using a shortcut called a relative phrase. Relative phrases are introduced by cmavo of selma'o GOI, and consist of a GOI cmavo followed by a single sumti.
Here is an example of __pe__ , plus an equivalent sentence using a relative clause:
**Example 8.18. **
le | stizu | pe | mi | cu | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair | associated-with | me |  | is-blue.  
My chair is blue.  
---  
  

**Example 8.19. **
le | stizu | poi | ke'a | srana | mi | cu | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair | such-that-( | IT | is-associated-with | me | ) | is-blue.  
  

In Example 8.18 and Example 8.19, the link between the chair and the speaker is of the loosest kind.
Here is an example of __po__ :
**Example 8.20. **
le | stizu | po | mi | cu | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair | specific-to | me |  | is-red.  
  

**Example 8.21. **
le | stizu | poi | ke'a | se steci | srana | mi | cu | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair | such-that-( | IT | is-specifically | associated-with | me | ) | is-red.  
  

Example 8.20 and Example 8.21 contrast with Example 8.18 and Example 8.19: the chair is more permanently connected with the speaker. A plausible (though not the only possible) contrast between Example 8.18 and Example 8.20 is that _pe mi_ would be appropriate for a chair the speaker is currently sitting on (whether or not the speaker owned that chair), and _po mi_ for a chair owned by the speaker (whether or not he or she was currently occupying it).
As a result, the relationship expressed between two sumti by __po__ is usually called “possession”, although it does not necessarily imply ownership, legal or otherwise. The central concept is that of specificity (__steci__ in Lojban).
Here is an example of __po'e__ , as well as another example of __po__ :
**Example 8.22. **
le | birka | po'e | mi | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | arm | intrinsically-possessed-by | me |  | is-broken  
  

**Example 8.23. **
le | birka | poi | jinzi | ke | se steci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | arm | which | is-intrinsically | ( | specifically  
srana | mi | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---  
associated-with) | me |  | is-broken.  
  

**Example 8.24. **
le | botpi | po | mi | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | bottle | specific-to | me |  | is-broken  
  

Example 8.22 and Example 8.23 on the one hand, and Example 8.24 on the other, illustrate the contrast between two types of possession called “intrinsic” and “extrinsic”, or sometimes “inalienable” and “alienable”, respectively. Something is intrinsically (or inalienably) possessed by someone if the possession is part of the possessor, and cannot be changed without changing the possessor. In the case of Example 8.22, people are usually taken to intrinsically possess their arms: even if an arm is cut off, it remains the arm of that person. (If the arm is transplanted to another person, however, it becomes intrinsically possessed by the new user, though, so intrinsic possession is a matter of degree.)
By contrast, the bottle of Example 8.24 can be given away, or thrown away, or lost, or stolen, so it is possessed extrinsically (alienably). The exact line between intrinsic and extrinsic possession is culturally dependent. The U.S. Declaration of Independence speaks of the “inalienable rights” of men, but just what those rights are, and even whether the concept makes sense at all, varies from culture to culture.
Note that Example 8.22 can also be expressed without a relative clause:
**Example 8.25. **
le | birka | be | mi | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | arm | of-body | me |  | is-broken  
  

reflecting the fact that the gismu __birka__ has an x2 place representing the body to which the arm belongs. Many, but not all, cases of intrinsic possession can be thus covered without using __po'e__ by placing the possessor into the appropriate place of the description selbri.
Here is an example of __po'u__ :
**Example 8.26. **
le | gerku | po'u | le | mi | pendo | cu | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which-is |  | my | friend |  | kisses | me.  
  

**Example 8.27. **
le | gerku | poi | du | le | mi | pendo | cu | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which | = |  | my | friend |  | kisses | me.  
  

The cmavo __po'u__ does not represent possession at all, but rather identity. (Note that it means _poi du_ and its form was chosen to suggest the relationship.)
In Example 8.26, the use of __po'u__ tells us that _le gerku_ and _le mi pendo_ represent the same thing. Consider the contrast between Example 8.26 and:
**Example 8.28. **
le | mi | pendo | po'u | le | gerku | cu | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| My | friend | which-is | the | dog |  | kisses | me.  
  

The facts of the case are the same, but the listener's knowledge about the situation may not be. In Example 8.26, the listener is presumed not to understand which dog is meant by _le gerku_ , so the speaker adds a relative phrase clarifying that it is the particular dog which is the speaker's friend.
Example 8.28, however, assumes that the listener does not know which of the speaker's friends is referred to, and specifies that it is the friend that is the dog (which dog is taken to be obvious). Here is another example of the same contrast:
**Example 8.29. **
le | tcadu | po'u | la nu,iork  
---|---|---|---  
The city of New--York [not another city]  
---  
  

**Example 8.30. **
la nu,iork | po'u | le | tcadu  
---|---|---|---  
New--York -- the city (not the state or some other New York)  
---  
  

The principle that the possessor and the possessed may change places applies to all the GOI cmavo, and allows for the possibility of odd effects:
**Example 8.31. **
le | kabri | pe | le | mi | pendo | cu | cmalu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | cup | associated-with |  | my | friend |  | is-small.  
My friend's cup is small  
---  
  

**Example 8.32. **
le | mi | pendo | pe | le | kabri | cu | cmalu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| My | friend | associated-with | the | cup |  | is-small.  
My friend, the one with the cup, is small.  
---  
  

Example 8.31 is useful in a context which is about my friend, and states that his or her cup is small, whereas Example 8.32 is useful in a context that is primarily about a certain cup, and makes a claim about “my friend of the cup”, as opposed to some other friend of mine. Here the cup appears to “possess” the person! English can't even express this relationship with a possessive – “the cup's friend of mine” looks like nonsense – but Lojban has no trouble doing so.
Finally, the cmavo __ne__ and __no'u__ stand to __pe__ and __po'u__ , respectively, as __noi__ does to _poi-_ they provide incidental information:
**Example 8.33. **
le | blabi | gerku | ne | mi | cu | batci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | white | dog, | incidentally-associated-with | me | , | bites | you.  
The white dog, which is mine, bites you.  
---  
  

In Example 8.33, the white dog is already fully identified (after all, presumably the listener knows which dog bit him or her!). The fact that it is yours is merely incidental to the main bridi claim.
Distinguishing between __po'u__ and __no'u__ can be a little tricky. Consider a room with several men in it, one of whom is named Jim. If you don't know their names, I might say:
**Example 8.34. **
le | nanmu | no'u | la | djim. | cu | terpemci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man, | incidentally-who-is | that-named | Jim | , | is-a-poet.  
The man, Jim, is a poet.  
---  
  

Here I am saying that one of the men is a poet, and incidentally telling you that he is Jim. But if you do know the names, then
**Example 8.35. **
le | nanmu | po'u | la | djim. | cu | terpemci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | who-is | that-named | Jim |  | is-a-poet.  
The man Jim is a poet.  
---  
  

is appropriate. Now I am using the fact that the man I am speaking of is Jim in order to pick out which man I mean.
It is worth mentioning that English sometimes over-specifies possession from the Lojban point of view (and the point of view of many other languages, including ones closely related to English). The idiomatic English sentence
**Example 8.36. **
The man put his hands in his pockets.
  

seems strange to a French- or German-speaking person: whose pockets would he put his hands into? and even odder, whose hands would he put into his pockets? In Lojban, the sentence
**Example 8.37. **
le | nanmu | cu | punji | le | xance |  | le | daski  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man |  | puts | the | hand | at-locus | the | pocket.  
  

is very natural. Of course, if the man is in fact putting his hands into another's pockets, or another's hands into his pockets, the fact can be specified.
Finally, the elidable terminator for GOI cmavo is __ge'u__ of selma'o GEhU; it is almost never required. However, if a logical connective immediately follows a sumti modified by a relative phrase, then an explicit __ge'u__ is needed to allow the connective to affect the relativized sumti rather than the sumti of the relative phrase. (What about the cmavo after which selma'o GOI is named? It is discussed in Section 7.5, as it is not semantically akin to the other kinds of relative phrases, although the syntax is the same.)

## 7.7. Indefinite pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the zo'e-series and the co'e-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
zo'e |  KOhA |  zo'e-series |  the obvious value  
---|---|---|---  
zu'i |  KOhA |  zo'e-series |  the typical value  
zi'o |  KOhA |  zo'e-series |  the nonexistent value  
co'e |  GOhA |  co'e-series |  has the obvious relationship  
The cmavo of the zo'e-series represent indefinite, unspecified sumti. The cmavo __zo'e__ represents an elliptical value for this sumti place; it is the optional spoken place holder when a sumti is skipped without being specified. Note that the elliptical value is not always the typical value. The properties of ellipsis lead to an elliptical sumti being defined as “whatever I want it to mean but haven't bothered to figure out, or figure out how to express”.
The cmavo __zu'i__ , on the other hand, represents the typical value for this place of this bridi:
**Example 7.49. **
mi | klama | le | bartu | be | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | outside | of | the | house | from  
le | nenri | be | le | zdani | zu'i | zu'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | inside | of | the | house | [by-typical-route] | [by-typical-means]  
  

In Example 7.49, the first __zu'i__ probably means something like “by the door”, and the second __zu'i__ probably means something like “on foot”, those being the typical route and means for leaving a house. On the other hand, if you are at the top of a high rise during a fire, neither __zu'i__ is appropriate. It's also common to use __zu'i__ in “by standard” places.
Finally, the cmavo __zi'o__ represents a value which does not even exist. When a bridi fills one of its places with __zi'o__ , what is really meant is that the selbri has a place which is irrelevant to the true relationship the speaker wishes to express. For example, the place structure of __zbasu__ is:
> actor x1 makes x2 from materials x3
Consider the sentence
> Living things are made from cells.
This cannot be correctly expressed as:
**Example 7.50. **
loi | jmive | cu | se zbasu | [zo'e] | fi | loi | selci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-mass-of | living-things |  | is-made | [by-something] | from | the-mass-of | cells  
  

because the __zo'e__ , expressed or understood, in Example 7.50 indicates that there is still a “maker” in this relationship. We do not generally suppose, however, that someone “makes” living things from cells. The best answer is probably to find a different selbri, one which does not imply a “maker”: however, an alternative strategy is to use __zi'o__ to eliminate the maker place:
**Example 7.51. **
loi | jmive | cu  
---|---|---  
The-mass-of | living-things |   
se zbasu | zi'o |  | loi | selci  
---|---|---|---|---  
is-made | [without-maker] | from | the-mass-of | cells.  
  

Note: The use of __zi'o__ to block up, as it were, one place of a selbri actually creates a new selbri with a different place structure. Consider the following examples:
**Example 7.52. **
mi | zbasu | le | dinju |  | loi | mudri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | make | the | building | from | some-of-the-mass-of | wood.  
I make the building out of wood.  
---  
  

**Example 7.53. **
zi'o | zbasu | le | dinju |  | loi | mudri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[without-maker] | makes | the | building | from | some-of-the-mass-of | wood.  
The building is made out of wood.  
---  
  

**Example 7.54. **
mi | zbasu | zi'o |  | loi | mudri  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | make | [without-thing-made] | from | some-of-the-mass-of | wood.  
I build using wood.  
---  
  

**Example 7.55. **
mi | zbasu | le | dinju | zi'o  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | make | the | building | [without-material].  
I make the building.  
---  
  

If Example 7.52 is true, then Example 7.53 through Example 7.55 must be true also. However, Example 7.51 does not correspond to any sentence with three regular (non- __zi'o__) sumti.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ (which by itself constitutes the co'e-series of selma'o GOhA) represents the elliptical selbri. Lojban grammar does not allow the speaker to merely omit a selbri from a bridi, although any or all sumti may be freely omitted. Being vague about a relationship requires the use of __co'e__ as a selbri place-holder:
**Example 7.56. **
mi | troci | le | nu | mi | co'e | le | vorme  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | try | the | event-of | my | [doing-the-obvious-action] | to-the | door.  
I try the door.  
---  
  

The English version means, and the Lojban version probably means, that I try to open the door, but the relationship of opening is not actually specified; the Lojbanic listener must guess it from context. Lojban, unlike English, makes it clear that there is an implicit action that is not being expressed.
The form of __co'e__ was chosen to resemble __zo'e__ ; the cmavo __do'e__ of selma'o BAI (see Section 9.6) also belongs to the same group of cmavo.
Note that __do'i__ , of the di'u-series, is also a kind of indefinite pro-sumti: it is indefinite in referent, but is restricted to referring only to an utterance.

The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
da |  KOhA |  da-series |  something-1   
---|---|---|---  
de |  KOhA |  da-series |  something-2  
di |  KOhA |  da-series |  something-3

Bound variables belong to the predicate-logic part of Lojban, and are listed here for completeness only. Their semantics is explained in Chapter 16. It is worth mentioning that the Lojban translation of Example 7.2 is:
**Example 7.73. **
la | djan. | cu | lafti | da | poi

## 16.6. Variables with generalized quantifiers
So far, we have seen variables with either nothing in front, or with the cmavo __ro__ in front. Now __ro__ is a Lojban number, and means “all”; thus _ro prenu_ means “all persons”, just as _re prenu_ means “two persons”. In fact, unadorned __da__ is also taken to have an implicit number in front of it, namely __su'o__ , which means “at least one”. Why is this? Consider Example 16.9 again, this time with an explicit __su'o__ :
**Example 16.33. **
su'o | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-at-least-one | X | : | X | sees | me.  
Something sees me.  
---  
  

From this version of Example 16.9, we understand the speaker's claim to be that of all the things that there are, at least one of them sees him or her. The corresponding universal claim, Example 16.16, says that of all the things that exist, every one of them can see the speaker.
Any other number can be used instead of __ro__ or __su'o__ to precede a variable. Then we get claims like:
**Example 16.34. **
re | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-two | Xes | : | X | sees | me.  
Two things see me.  
---  
  

This means that exactly two things, no more or less, saw the speaker on the relevant occasion. In English, we might take “Two things see me” to mean that at least two things see the speaker, but there might be more; in Lojban, though, that claim would have to be made as:
**Example 16.35. **
su'ore | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-at-least-two | Xes | : | X | sees | me.  
  

which would be false if nothing, or only one thing, saw the speaker, but not otherwise. We note the __su'o__ here meaning “at least”; __su'o__ by itself is short for _su'opa_ where __pa__ means “one”, as is explained in Section 18.9.
The prenex may be removed from Example 16.34 and Example 16.35 as from the others, leading to:
**Example 16.36. **
re | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---  
Two | Xes | see | me.  
  

and
**Example 16.37. **
su'ore | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---  
At-least-two | Xes | see | me.  
  

respectively, subject to the rules prescribed in Section 16.5.
Now we can explain the constructions _ro prenu_ for “all persons” and _re prenu_ for “two persons” which were casually mentioned at the beginning of this Section. In fact, _ro prenu_ , a so-called “indefinite description”, is shorthand for _ro DA poi prenu_ , where “DA” represents a fictitious variable that hasn't been used yet and will not be used in future. (Even if all three of __da__ , __de__ , and __di__ have been used up, it does not matter, for there are ways of getting more variables, discussed in Section 16.14.) So in fact
**Example 16.38. **
re | prenu | cu | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
Two | persons |  | see | me.  
  

is short for
**Example 16.39. **
re | da | poi | prenu | cu | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | Xes | which | are-persons |  | see | me.  
  

which in turn is short for:
**Example 16.40. **
re | da | poi | prenu | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-two | Xes | which | are-persons | : | X | sees | me.  
  

Note that when we move more than one variable to the prenex (along with its attached relative clause), we must make sure that the variables are in the same order in the prenex as in the bridi proper.

## 13.12. Discursives
The term “discursive” is used for those members of selma'o UI that provide structure to the discourse, and which show how a given word or utterance relates to the whole discourse. To express these concepts in regular bridi would involve extra layers of nesting: rather than asserting that “I also came”, we would have to say “I came; furthermore, the event of my coming is an additional instance of the relationship expressed by the previous sentence”, which is intolerably clumsy. Typical English equivalents of discursives are words or phrases like “however”, “summarizing”, “in conclusion”, and “for example”.
Discursives are not attitudinals: they express no particular emotion. Rather, they are abbreviations for metalinguistic claims that reference the sentence or text they are found in.
Discursives are most often used at the beginning of sentences, often attached to the __i__ that separates sentences in running discourse, but can (like all other indicators) be attached to single words when it seems necessary or useful.
The discursives discussed in this section are given in groups, roughly organized by function. First, the “consecutive discourse” group:
ku'i |  [karbi] |  however/but/in contrast  
---|---|---  
ji'a |  [jmina] |  additionally  
si'a |  [simsa] |  similarly  
mi'u |  [mintu] |  ditto  
po'o |  |  the only relevant case  
These five discursives are mutually exclusive, and therefore they are not usually considered as scales. The first four are used in consecutive discourse. The first, __ku'i__ , makes an exception to the previous argument. The second, __ji'a__ , adds weight to the previous argument. The third, __si'a__ , adds quantity to the previous argument, enumerating an additional example. The fourth, __mi'u__ , adds a parallel case to the previous argument, and can also be used in tables or the like to show that something is being repeated from the previous column. It is distinct from __go'i__ (of selma'o GOhA, discussed in Section 7.6), which is a non-discursive version of “ditto” that explicitly repeats the claim of the previous bridi.
Lastly, __po'o__ is used when there is no other comparable case, and thus corresponds to some of the uses of “only”, a word difficult to express in pure bridi form:
**Example 13.83. **
mi | po'o | darxi | le | mi | tamne | fo | le | nazbi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [only] | hit | the | of-me | cousin | at-locus | the | nose.  
Only I (nobody else) hit my cousin on his nose.  
---  
  

**Example 13.84. **
mi | darxi | po'o | le | mi | tamne | fo | le | nazbi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | hit | [only] | the | of-me | cousin | at-locus | the | nose.  
I only hit my cousin on his nose (I did nothing else to him).  
---  
  

**Example 13.85. **
mi | darxi | le | mi | tamne | po'o | fo | le | nazbi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | hit | the | of-me | cousin | [only] | at-locus | the | nose.  
I hit only my cousin on his nose (no one else).  
---  
  

**Example 13.86. **
mi | darxi | le | mi | tamne | fo | le | nazbi | po'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | hit | the | of-me | cousin | at-locus | the | nose | [only].  
I hit my cousin only on his nose (nowhere else).  
---  
  

Note that “only” can go before or after what it modifies in English, but __po'o__ , as an indicator, always comes afterward.
Next, the “commentary on words” group:
va'i |  [valsi] |  in other words |  in the same words  
---|---|---|---  
ta'u |  [tanru] |  expanding a tanru |  making a tanru  
The discursives __va'i__ and __ta'u__ operate at the level of words, rather than discourse proper, or if you like, they deal with how things are said. An alternative English expression for __va'i__ is “rephrasing”; for __va'inai__ , “repeating”. Also compare __va'i__ with __ke'u__ , discussed below.
The cmavo __ta'u__ is a discursive unique to Lojban; it expresses the particularly Lojbanic device of tanru. Since tanru are semantically ambiguous, they are subject to misunderstanding. This ambiguity can be removed by expanding the tanru into some semantically unambiguous structure, often involving relative clauses or the introduction of additional brivla. The discursive __ta'u__ marks the transition from the use of a brief but possibly confusing tanru to its fuller, clearer expansion; the discursive __ta'unai__ marks a transition in the reverse direction.
Next, the “commentary on discourse” group:
li'a |  [klina] |  clearly; obviously |  |  obscurely  
---|---|---|---|---  
ba'u |  [banli] |  exaggeration |  accuracy |  understatement  
zo'o |  |  humorously |  dully |  seriously  
sa'e |  [satci] |  precisely speaking |  |  loosely speaking  
to'u |  [tordu] |  in brief |  |  in detail  
do'a |  [dunda] |  generously |  |  parsimoniously  
sa'u |  [sampu] |  simply |  |  elaborating  
pa'e |  [pajni] |  justice |  |  prejudice  
je'u |  [jetnu] |  truly |  |  falsely  
This group is used by the speaker to characterize the nature of the discourse, so as to prevent misunderstanding. It is well-known that listeners often fail to recognize a humorous statement and take it seriously, or miss an exaggeration, or try to read more into a statement than the speaker intends to put there. In speech, the tone of voice often provides the necessary cue, but the reader of ironic or understated or imprecise discourse is often simply clueless. As with the attitudinals, the use of these cmavo may seem fussy to new Lojbanists, but it is important to remember that __zo'o__ , for example, is the equivalent of smiling while you speak, not the equivalent of a flat declaration like “What I'm about to say is supposed to be funny.”
A few additional English equivalents: for __sa'enai__ , “roughly speaking” or “approximately speaking”; for __sa'unai__ , “furthermore”; for __to'u__ , “in short” or “skipping details”; for __do'a__ , “broadly construed”; for __do'anai__ (as you might expect), “narrowly construed”.
The cmavo __pa'e__ is used to claim (truly or falsely) that one is being fair or just to all parties mentioned, whereas __pa'enai__ admits (or proclaims) a bias in favor of one party.
The scale of __je'u__ and __je'unai__ is a little different from the others in the group. By default, we assume that people speak the truth – or at least, that if they are lying, they will do their best to conceal it from us. So under what circumstances would __je'unai__ be used, or __je'u__ be useful? For one thing, __je'u__ can be used to mark a tautology: a sentence that is a truth of logic, like “All cats are cats.” Its counterpart __je'unai__ then serves to mark a logical contradiction. In addition, __je'unai__ can be used to express one kind of sarcasm or irony, where the speaker pretends to believe what he/she says, but actually wishes the listener to infer a contrary opinion. Other forms of irony can be marked with __zo'o__ (humor) or __.ianai__ (disbelief).
When used as a discursive, __su'a__ (see Section 13.11) belongs to this group.
Next, the “knowledge” group:
ju'o |  [djuno] |  certainly |  uncertain |  certainly not  
---|---|---|---|---  
la'a |  [lakne] |  probably |  |  improbably  
These two discursives describe the speaker's state of knowledge about the claim of the associated bridi. They are similar to the propositional attitudes of Section 13.3, as they create a hypothetical world. We may be quite certain that something is true, and label our bridi with __ju'o__ ; but it may be false all the same.
Next, the “discourse management” group:
ta'o |  [tanjo] |  by the way |  |  returning to point  
---|---|---|---|---  
ra'u |  [ralju] |  chiefly |  equally |  incidentally  
mu'a |  [mupli] |  for example |  omitting examples |  end examples  
zu'u |  |  on the one hand |  |  on the other hand  
ke'u |  [krefu] |  repeating |  |  continuing  
da'i |  |  supposing |  |  in fact  
This final group is used to perform what may be called “managing the discourse”: providing reference points to help the listener understand the flow from one sentence to the next.
Other English equivalents of __ta'onai__ are “anyway”, “anyhow”, “in any case”, “in any event”, “as I was saying”, and “continuing”.
The scale of __ra'u__ has to do with the importance of the point being, or about to be, expressed: __ra'u__ is the most important point, __ra'ucu'i__ is a point of equal importance, and __ra'unai__ is a lesser point. Other English equivalents of __ra'u__ are “above all” and “primarily”.
The cmavo __ke'u__ is very similar to __va'i__ , although __ke'unai__ and __va'inai__ are quite different. Both __ke'u__ and __va'i__ indicate that the same idea is going to be expressed using different words, but the two cmavo differ in emphasis. Using __ke'u__ emphasizes that the content is the same; using __va'i__ emphasizes that the words are different. Therefore, __ke'unai__ shows that the content is new (and therefore the words are also); __va'inai__ shows that the words are the same (and therefore so is the content). One English equivalent of __ke'unai__ is “furthermore”.
The discursive __da'i__ marks the discourse as possibly taking a non-real-world viewpoint (“Supposing that”, “By hypothesis”), whereas __da'inai__ insists on the real-world point of view (“In fact”, “In truth”, “According to the facts”). A common use of __da'i__ is to distinguish between:
**Example 13.87. **
ganai | da'i | do | viska | le | mi | citno | mensi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
If | [hypothetical] | you | see | the | of-me | young | sister,  
gi | ju'o | do | djuno | le | du'u | ri | pazvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [certain] | you | know | the | predication-of | she | is-pregnant.  
If you were to see my younger sister, you would certainly know she is pregnant.  
---  
  

and:
**Example 13.88. **
ganai | da'inai | do | viska | le | mi | citno | mensi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
If | [factual] | you | see | the | of-me | young | sister,  
gi | ju'o | do | djuno | le | du'u | ri | pazvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [certainty] | you | know | the | predication-of | she | is-pregnant.  
If you saw my younger sister, you would certainly know she is pregnant.  
---  
  

It is also perfectly correct to omit the discursive altogether, and leave the context to indicate which significance is meant. (Chinese always leaves this distinction to the context: the Chinese sentence
**Example 13.89. **
  * _ru 2guo3 ni3 kan4dao4 wo3 mei4mei, ni3 yi2ding4 zhi1dao4 ta1 huai2yun4 le_
  * if you see-arrive my younger-sister, you certainly know she pregnant


  

is the equivalent of either Example 13.87 or Example 13.88.)

fi'a |  FA |  place structure question  
In sentences like Example 9.1, it is easy to get lost and forget which sumti falls in which place, especially if the sumti are more complicated than simple names or descriptions. The place structure tags of selma'o FA may be used to help clarify place structures. The five cmavo __fa__ , __fe__ , __fi__ , __fo__ , and __fu__ may be inserted just before the sumti in the x1 to x5 places respectively:
**Example 9.8. **
fa | mi | cu | klama | fe | la | bastn. | fi | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x1= | I |  | go | x2= | that-named | Boston | x3= | that-named | Atlanta  
fo | le | dargu | fu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
x4= | the | road | x5= | the | car.  
I go to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.8, the tag __fu__ before _le karce_ clarifies that _le karce_ occupies the x5 place of __klama__. The use of __fu__ tells us nothing about the purpose or meaning of the x5 place; it simply says that _le karce_ occupies it.
In Example 9.8, the tags are overkill; they serve only to make Example 9.1 even longer than it is. Here is a better illustration of the use of FA tags for clarification:
**Example 9.9. **
fa | mi | klama | fe | le | zdani | be | mi | be'o | poi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x1= | I | go | x2= | (the | house | of | me) |  | which  
nurma | vau | fi | la | nu,IORK.  
---|---|---|---|---  
is-rural |  | x3= | that-named | New-York.  
  

In Example 9.9, the place structure of __klama__ is as follows:
x1 | agent |  _ _mi_ _  
---|---|---  
x2 | destination |  _le zdani be mi be'o poi nurma vau_  
x3 | origin |  _la nu,IORK._  
x4 | route | (empty)  
x5 | means | (empty)  
The __fi__ tag serves to remind the hearer that what follows is in the x3 place of __klama__ ; after listening to the complex sumti occupying the x2 place, it's easy to get lost.
Of course, once the sumti have been tagged, the order in which they are specified no longer carries the burden of distinguishing the places. Therefore, it is perfectly all right to scramble them into any order desired, and to move the selbri to anywhere in the bridi, even the beginning:
**Example 9.10. **
klama | fa | mi | fi | la | .atlantas. | fu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
go | x1= | I | x3= | that-named | Atlanta | x5= | the | car  
fe | la | bastn. | fo | le | dargu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston | x4= | the | road.  
Go I from Atlanta using the car to Boston via the road.  
---  
  

Note that no __cu__ is permitted before the selbri in Example 9.10, because __cu__ separates the selbri from any preceding sumti, and Example 9.10 has no such sumti.
**Example 9.11. **
fu | le | karce | fo | le | dargu | fi | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x5= | the | car | x4= | the | road | x3= | that-named | Atlanta  
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I  
Using the car, via the road, from Atlanta to Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.11 exhibits the reverse of the standard bridi form seen in Example 9.1 and Example 9.8, but still means exactly the same thing. If the FA tags were left out, however, producing:
**Example 9.12. **
le | karce | le | dargu | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | car | to-the | road | from-that-named | Atlanta  
la | bastn. | cu | klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
via-that-named | Boston |  | goes | using-me.  
The car goes to the road from Atlanta, with Boston as the route, using me as a means of transport.  
---  
  

the meaning would be wholly changed, and in fact nonsensical.
Tagging places with FA cmavo makes it easy not only to reorder the places but also to omit undesirable ones, without any need for __zo'e__ or special rules about the x1 place:
**Example 9.13. **
klama | fi | la | .atlantas. | fe | la | bastn.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A-goer | x3= | that-named | Atlanta | x2= | that-named | Boston  
fu | le | karce  
---|---|---  
x5= | the | car.  
A goer from Atlanta to Boston using the car.  
---  
  

Here the x1 and x4 places are empty, and so no sumti are tagged with __fa__ or __fo__ ; in addition, the x2 and x3 places appear in reverse order.
What if some sumti have FA tags and others do not? The rule is that after a FA-tagged sumti, any sumti following it occupy the places numerically succeeding it, subject to the proviso that an already-filled place is skipped:
**Example 9.14. **
klama | fa | mi | la | bastn. | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go | x1= | I | x2=that-named | Boston | x3=that-named | Atlanta  
le | dargu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---  
x4=the | road | x5=the | car.  
Go I to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.14, the __fa__ causes __mi__ to occupy the x1 place, and then the following untagged sumti occupy in order the x2 through x5 places. This is the mechanism by which Lojban allows placing the selbri first while specifying a sumti for the x1 place.
Here is a more complex (and more confusing) example:
**Example 9.15. **
mi | klama | fi | la | .atlantas. | le | dargu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go | x3= | that-named | Atlanta, | the | road  
fe | la | bastn. | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston, | the | car.  
I go from Atlanta via the road to Boston using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.15, __mi__ occupies the x1 place because it is the first sumti in the sentence (and is before the selbri). The second sumti, _la .atlantas._ , occupies the x3 place by virtue of the tag __fi__ , and _le dargu_ occupies the x4 place as a result of following _la .atlantas._. Finally, _la bastn._ occupies the x2 place because of its tag __fe__ , and _le karce_ skips over the already-occupied x3 and x4 places to land in the x5 place.
Such a convoluted use of tags should probably be avoided except when trying for a literal translation of some English (or other natural-language) sentence; the rules stated here are merely given so that some standard interpretation is possible.
It is grammatically permitted to tag more than one sumti with the same FA cmavo. The effect is that of making more than one claim:
**Example 9.16. **
[fa] | la | rik. | fa | la | djein. | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[x1=] | that-named | Rick | x1= | that-named | Jane | goes-to  
[fe] | le | skina | fe | le | zdani | fe | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[x2=] | the | movie | x2= | the | house | x2= | the | office  
  

may be taken to say that both Rick and Jane go to the movie, the house, and the office, merging six claims into one. More likely, however, it will simply confuse the listener. There are better ways, involving logical connectives (explained in Chapter 14), to say such things in Lojban. In fact, putting more than one sumti into a place is odd enough that it can only be done by explicit FA usage: this is the motivation for the proviso above, that already-occupied places are skipped. In this way, no sumti can be forced into a place already occupied unless it has an explicit FA cmavo tagging it.
The cmavo __fi'a__ also belongs to selma'o FA, and allows Lojban users to ask questions about place structures. A bridi containing __fi'a__ is a question, asking the listener to supply the appropriate other member of FA which will make the bridi a true statement:
**Example 9.17. **
fi'a | do | dunda | [fe] | le | vi | rozgu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[what-place]? | you | give | x2= | the | nearby | rose  
In what way are you involved in the giving of this rose?  
---  
Are you the giver or the receiver of this rose?  
  

In Example 9.17, the speaker uses the selbri __dunda__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _dunda_ _ x1 gives x2 to x3
The tagged sumti _fi'a do_ indicates that the speaker wishes to know whether the sumti __do__ falls in the x1 or the x3 place (the x2 place is already occupied by _le rozgu_). The listener can reply with a sentence consisting solely of a FA cmavo: __fa__ if the listener is the giver, __fi__ if he/she is the receiver.
I have inserted the tag __fe__ in brackets into Example 9.17, but it is actually not necessary, because __fi'a__ does not count as a numeric tag; therefore, _le vi rozgu_ would necessarily be in the x2 place even if no tag were present, because it immediately follows the selbri.
There is also another member of FA, namely __fai__ , which is discussed in Section 9.12.
