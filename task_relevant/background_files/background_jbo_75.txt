## 9.16. CV'V cmavo of selma'o BAI with irregular forms
There are 65 cmavo of selma'o BAI, of which all but one (__do'e__ , discussed in Section 9.6), are derived directly from selected gismu. Of these 64 cmavo, 36 are entirely regular and have the form CV'V, where C is the first consonant of the corresponding gismu, and the Vs are the two vowels of the gismu. The remaining BAI cmavo, which are irregular in one way or another, are listed in the table below. The table is divided into sub-tables according to the nature of the exception; some cmavo appear in more than one sub-table, and are so noted.

## 9.17. Complete table of BAI cmavo with rough English equivalents
The following table shows all the cmavo belonging to selma'o BAI, and has five columns. The first column is the cmavo itself; the second column is the gismu linked to it. The third column gives an English phrase which indicates the meaning of the cmavo; and the fourth column indicates its meaning when preceded by __se__.
For those cmavo with meaningful __te__ , __ve__ , and even __xe__ conversions (depending on the number of places of the underlying gismu), the meanings of these are shown on one or two extra rows following the primary row for that cmavo.
It should be emphasized that the place structures of the gismu control the meanings of the BAI cmavo. The English phrases shown here are only suggestive, and are often too broad or too narrow to correctly specify what the acceptable range of uses for the modal tag are.

The lujvo __tamsmi__ on which __tai__ is based is derived from the tanru _tarmi simsa_ and has the place structure:
> _ _tamsmi_ _ x1 has form x2, similar in form to x3 in property/quality x4
This lujvo is employed because __tarmi__ does not have a place structure useful for the modal's purpose.

## 2.16. Indicators
Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. “Aha!”, “Oh no!”, “Ouch!”, “Aahh!”, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.
Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left. For example:
**Example 2.79. **
.ie |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Agreement! |  I |  - |  go.  
Yep! I'll go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.80. **
.ei |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Obligation! |  I |  - |  go.  
I should go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.81. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  le melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go |  to-the beautiful-thing  
.ui |  [ku]  
---|---  
and I am happy because it is the beautiful thing I'm going to |  -  
  

Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison, the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means “and”.
**Example 2.82. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  You |  - |  stay.  
  

**Example 2.83. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ji'a |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  In addition, |  you |  - |  stay. |  added weight  
  

**Example 2.84. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ku'i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  However, |  you |  - |  stay. |  contrast  
  

Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”. Evidentials show the speaker's relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include __za'a__ (I directly observe the relationship), __pe'i__ (I believe that the relationship holds), __ru'a__ (I postulate the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.
**Example 2.85. **
pe'i |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I opine! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.  
  

**Example 2.86. **
za'a |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I directly observe! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.

## 2.11. Examples of brivla
The simplest form of selbri is an individual word. A word which may by itself express a selbri relation is called a __brivla__. The three types of brivla are gismu (root words), lujvo (compounds), and fu'ivla (borrowings from other languages). All have identical grammatical uses. So far, most of our selbri have been gismu or tanru built from gismu.
gismu:
**Example 2.46. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  ti |  zo'e |  zo'e |  ta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go-er |  - |  goes |  destination |  origin |  route |  means.  
I go here (to this) using that means (from somewhere via some route).  
---  
  

lujvo:
**Example 2.47. **
ta |  [cu] |  blari'o  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  is-blue-green.  
  

fu'ivla:
**Example 2.48. **
ti |  [cu] |  djarspageti  
---|---|---  
This |  - |  is-spaghetti.  
  

Some cmavo may also serve as selbri, acting as variables that stand for another selbri. The most commonly used of these is __go'i__ , which represents the main bridi of the previous Lojban sentence, with any new sumti or other sentence features being expressed replacing the previously expressed ones. Thus, in this context:
**Example 2.49. **
ta |  [cu] |  go'i  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  too/same-as-last selbri.  
That (is spaghetti), too.  
---

## 17.12. Acronyms
An acronym is a name constructed of lerfu. English examples are “DNA”, “NATO”, “CIA”. In English, some of these are spelled out (like “DNA” and “CIA”) and others are pronounced more or less as if they were ordinary English words (like “NATO”). Some acronyms fluctuate between the two pronunciations: “SQL” may be “ess cue ell” or “sequel”.
In Lojban, a name can be almost any sequence of sounds that ends in a consonant and is followed by a pause. The easiest way to Lojbanize acronym names is to glue the lerfu words together, using _'_ wherever two vowels would come together (pauses are illegal in names) and adding a final consonant:
**Example 17.40. **
la dyny'abub. .i la ny'abuty'obub. .i la cy'ibu'abub.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulyl. .i la .ibubymym. .i la ny'ybucyc.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

There is no fixed convention for assigning the final consonant. In Example 17.40, the last consonant of the lerfu string has been replicated into final position.
Some compression can be done by leaving out __bu__ after vowel lerfu words (except for __.y.bu__ , wherein the __bu__ cannot be omitted without ambiguity). Compression is moderately important because it's hard to say long names without introducing an involuntary (and illegal) pause:
**Example 17.41. **
la dyny'am. .i la ny'aty'om. .i la cy'i'am.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulym. .i la .ibymym. .i la ny'ybucym.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

In Example 17.41, the final consonant _m_ stands for __merko__ , indicating the source culture of these acronyms.
Another approach, which some may find easier to say and which is compatible with older versions of the language that did not have a _'_ character, is to use the consonant _z_ instead of _'_ :
**Example 17.42. **
la dynyzaz. .i la nyzatyzoz. .i la cyzizaz.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulyz. .i la .ibymyz. .i la nyzybucyz.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

One more alternative to these lengthy names is to use the lerfu string itself prefixed with __me__ , the cmavo that makes sumti into selbri:
**Example 17.43. **
la | me | dy | ny. | .abu  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | what-pertains-to |  “d” |  “n” |  “a”  
  

This works because __la__ , the cmavo that normally introduces names used as sumti, may also be used before a predicate to indicate that the predicate is a (meaningful) name:
**Example 17.44. **
la | cribe | cu | ciska  
---|---|---|---  
That-named |  “Bear” |  | writes.  
Bear is a writer.  
---  
  

Example 17.44 does not of course refer to a bear (_le cribe_ or _lo cribe_) but to something else, probably a person, named “Bear”. Similarly, _me dy ny. .abu_ is a predicate which can be used as a name, producing a kind of acronym which can have pauses between the individual lerfu words.

## 14.14. Non-logical connectives
Way back in Section 14.1, the point was made that not every use of English “and”, “if ... then”, and so on represents a Lojban logical connective. In particular, consider the “and” of:
**Example 14.109. **
John and Alice carried the piano.
  

Given the nature of pianos, this probably means that John carried one end and Alice the other. So it is not true that:
**Example 14.110. **
John carried the piano, and Alice carried the piano.
  

which would mean that each of them carried the piano by himself/herself. Lojban deals with this particular linguistic phenomenon as a “mass”. John and Alice are joined together into a mass, John-and-Alice, and it is this mass which carried the piano, not either of them separately. The cmavo __joi__ (of selma'o JOI) is used to join two or more components into a mass:
**Example 14.111. **
la | djan. | joi | la | .alis. | cu | bevri | le | pipno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | massed-with | that-named | Alice |  | carry | the | piano.  
  

Example 14.111 covers the case mentioned, where John and Alice divide the labor; it also could mean that John did all the hauling and Alice did the supervising. This possibility arises because the properties of a mass are the properties of its components, which can lead to apparent contradictions: if John is small and Alice is large, then John-and-Alice is both small and large. Masses are also discussed in Section 6.3.
Grammatically, __joi__ can appear between two sumti (like an ek) or between two tanru components (like a jek). This flexibility must be paid for in the form of occasional terminators that cannot be elided:
**Example 14.112. **
le | nanmu | ku | joi | le | ninmu | [ku] | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man |  | massed-with | the | woman |  |  | go-to | the | market.  
  

The cmavo __ku__ is the elidable terminator for __le__ , which can almost always be elided, but not in this case. If the first __ku__ were elided here, Lojban's parsing rules would see _le nanmu joi_ and assume that another tanru component is to follow; since the second __le__ cannot be part of a tanru, a parsing error results. No such problem can occur with logical connectives, because an ek signals a following sumti and a jek a following tanru component unambiguously.
Single or compound cmavo involving members of selma'o JOI are called joiks, by analogy with the names for logical connectives. It is not grammatical to use joiks to connect bridi-tails.
In tanru, __joi__ has the connotation “mixed with”, as in the following example:
**Example 14.113. **
ti | blanu | joi | xunre | bolci  
---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-(blue | mixed-with | red) | ball.  
This is a blue and red ball.  
---  
  

Here the ball is neither wholly blue nor wholly red, but partly blue and partly red. Its blue/redness is a mass property. (Just how blue something has to be to count as “wholly blue” is an unsettled question, though. A _blanu zdani_ may be so even though not every part of it is blue.)
There are several other cmavo in selma'o JOI which can be used in the same grammatical constructions. Not all of them are well-defined as yet in all contexts. All have clear definitions as sumti connectives; those definitions are shown in the following table:
A __joi__ B | the mass with components A and B  
---|---  
A __ce__ B | the set with elements A and B  
A __ce'o__ B | the sequence with elements A and B in order  
A __se__ __ce'o__ B | the sequence with elements B and A in order  
A __jo'u__ B | A and B considered jointly  
A __fa'u__ B | A and B respectively  
A __se__ __fa'u__ B | B and A respectively  
A __jo'e__ B | the union of sets A and B  
A __ku'a__ B | the intersection of sets A and B  
A __pi'u__ B | the cross product of sets A and B  
A __se__ __pi'u__ B | the cross product of sets B and A  
The cmavo __se__ is grammatical before any JOI cmavo, but only useful with those that have inherent order. Here are some examples of joiks:
**Example 14.114. **
mi | cuxna | la | .alis. | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | choose | that-named | Alice | from-that-named | Frank  
ce | la | .alis. | ce | la | djeimyz.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and-member | that-named | Alice | and-member | that-named | James.  
I choose Alice from among Frank, Alice, and James.  
---  
  

The x3 place of __cuxna__ is a set from which the choice is being made. A set is an abstract object which is determined by specifying its members. Unlike those of a mass, the properties of a set are unrelated to its members' properties: the set of all rats is large (since many rats exist), but the rats themselves are small. This chapter does not attempt to explain set theory (the mathematical study of sets) in detail: explaining propositional logic is quite enough for one chapter!
In Example 14.114 we specify that set by listing the members with __ce__ joining them.
**Example 14.115. **
ti | liste | mi | ce'o | do | ce'o | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-list-of | me | and-sequence | you | and-sequence | that-named | John.  
This is a list of you, me, and John.  
---  
  

The x2 place of __liste__ is a sequence of the things which are mentioned in the list. (It is worth pointing out that _lo liste_ means a physical object such as a grocery list: a purely abstract list is _lo porsi_ , a sequence.) Here the three sumti connected by __ce'o__ are in a definite order, not just lumped together in a set or a mass.
So __joi__ , __ce__ , and __ce'o__ are parallel, in that the sumti connected are taken to be individuals, and the result is something else: a mass, a set, or a sequence respectively. The cmavo __jo'u__ serves as a fourth element in this pattern: the sumti connected are individuals, and the result is still individuals – but inseparably so. The normal Lojban way of saying that James and George are brothers is:
**Example 14.116. **
la | djeimyz. | bruna | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | is-the-brother-of | that-named | George.  
  

possibly adding a discursive element meaning “and vice versa”. However, “James and George are brothers” cannot be correctly translated as:
**Example 14.117. **
la | djeimyz. | .e | la | djordj. | bruna  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and | that-named | George | is-a-brother.  
  

since that expands to two bridi and means that James is a brother and so is George, but not necessarily of each other. If the __e__ is changed to __jo'u__ , however, the meaning of Example 14.116 is preserved:
**Example 14.118. **
la | djeimyz. | jo'u  
---|---|---  
That-named | James | in-common-with | that-named  
la | djordj. | cu | remei | bruna  
---|---|---|---|---  
George |  | are-a-twosome | type-of-brothers.  
  

The tanru _remei bruna_ is not strictly necessary in this sentence, but is used to make clear that we are not saying that James and George are both brothers of some third person not specified. Alternatively, we could turn the tanru around: the x1 place of __re__ __mei__ is a mass with two components, leading to:
**Example 14.119. **
la | djeimyz. | joi  
---|---|---  
That-named | James | massed-with  
la | djordj. | cu | bruna | remei  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George |  | are-a-brother | type-of-twosome.  
  

where __joi__ is used to create the necessary mass.
Likewise, __fa'u__ can be used to put two individuals together where order matters. Typically, there will be another __fa'u__ somewhere else in the same bridi:
**Example 14.120. **
la | djeimyz. | fa'u | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | jointly-in-order-with | that-named | George  
prami | la | meris. | fa'u | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
loves | that-named | Mary | jointly-in-order-with | that-named | Martha.  
James and George love Mary and Martha, respectively.  
---  
  

Here the information carried by the English adverb “respectively”, namely that James loves Mary and George loves Martha, is divided between the two occurrences of __fa'u__. If both uses of __fa'u__ were to be changed to __e__ , we would get:
**Example 14.121. **
la | djeimyz. | .e | la | djordj. | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and | that-named | George | love  
la | meris. | .e | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Mary | and | that-named | Martha.  
  

which can be transformed to four bridi:
**Example 14.122. **
la | djeimyz. | prami | la | meris. | .ije | la | djordj. | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | loves | that-named | Mary, | and | that-named | George | loves  
la | meris. | .ije | la | djeimyz. | prami | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Mary, | and | that-named | James | loves | that-named | Martha,  
.ije | la | djordj. | prami | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | that-named | George | loves | that-named | Martha.  
  

which represents quite a different state of affairs from Example 14.120. The meaning of Example 14.120 can also be conveyed by a termset:
**Example 14.123. **
la | djeimyz. | ce'e | la | meris. | pe'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | [plus] | that-named | Mary | [joint]  
.e | la | djordj. | ce'e | la | martas. | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | that-named | George | [plus] | that-named | Martha | loves.  
  

at the expense of re-ordering the list of names so as to make the pairs explicit. This option is not available when one of the lists is only described rather than enumerated:
**Example 14.124. **
la | djeimyz. | fa'u | la | djordj. | prami | re | mensi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and-respectively | that-named | George | love | two | sisters.  
  

which conveys that James loves one sister and George the other, though we are not able to tell which of the sisters is which.

## 11.4. Property abstractions
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ka |  NU |  property abstractor  
---|---|---  
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
The things described by _le nu_ descriptions (or, to put it another way, the things of which __nu__ selbri may correctly be predicated) are only moderately “abstract”. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is “the property of being blue”, or “the property of being a go-er”? They are what logicians call “intensions”. If John has a heart, then “the property of having a heart” is an abstract object which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,
**Example 11.21. **
la | djan. | cu | se risna | zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-as-heart | something-unspecified.  
John has a heart.  
---  
  

has the same truth conditions as
**Example 11.22. **
la | djan. | cu | ckaji  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-the-property  
le | ka | se risna | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | having-as-heart | something.  
John has the property of having a heart.  
---  
  

(The English word “have” frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban properties: things are said to “have” properties, but this is not the same sense of “have” as in “I have money”, which is possession.)
Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:
**Example 11.23. **
do | cnino | mi | le | ka | xunre | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-new | to-me | in-the-quality-of-the | property-of | being-red.  
You are new to me in redness.  
---  
  

(The English suffix “-ness” often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix “-ity”.)
We can also move the property description to the x1 place of Example 11.23, producing:
**Example 11.24. **
le | ka | do | xunre | [kei] | cu | cnino | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | property-of | your | being-red |  |  | is-new | to me.  
Your redness is new to me.  
---  
  

It would be suitable to use Example 11.23 and Example 11.24 to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.
There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:
**Example 11.25. **
ka | mi | prami | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | me | loving | something-unspecified  
  

is quite different from
**Example 11.26. **
ka | [zo'e] | prami | mi | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | something-unspecified | loving | me  
  

In particular, sentences like Example 11.27 and Example 11.28 are quite different in meaning:
**Example 11.27. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami  
---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X)  
I love John more than I love George.  
---  
  

**Example 11.28. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka |  | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property of | (X | loves | me).  
John loves me more than George loves me.  
---  
  

The “X” used in the glosses of Example 11.27 through Example 11.28 as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in Section 11.2. Instead, the cmavo __ce'u__ of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)
Therefore, an explicit equivalent of Example 11.27, with no ellipsis, is:
**Example 11.29. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami | ce'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X).  
  

and of Example 11.28 is:
**Example 11.30. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | ce'u | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (X | loves | me).  
  

This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:
**Example 11.31. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of |  | giving | the | horse  
  

into
**Example 11.32. **
le | ka | ce'u | dunda | le | xirma |  | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | someone-unspecified | )  
the property of being a giver of the horse  
---  
  

which is the most natural interpretation of Example 11.31, versus
**Example 11.33. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma |  | ce'u | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (someone-unspecified | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | X | )  
the property of being one to whom the horse is given  
---  
  

which is also a possible interpretation.
It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction. Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri __bridi__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _bridi_ _ x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction) among arguments (sequence/set) x3
The place structure of __ka__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> _ _ka_ _ x1 is a property of (the bridi)

## 7.11. Abstraction focus pro-sumti: _ce'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __ce'u__ is used within abstraction bridi, particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo __ka__. Abstractions, including the uses of __ce'u__ , are discussed in full in Chapter 11.
In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using __ce'u__. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly between:
**Example 7.71. **
le | ka | ce'u | gleki  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | being-happy)  
the property of being happy  
---  
happiness  
  

and
**Example 7.72. **
le | ka | gleki | ce'u  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (being-happy-about | X)  
the property of being that which someone is happy about

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 9.4. Conversion: SE
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
se |  SE |  2nd place conversion  
---|---|---  
te |  SE |  3rd place conversion  
ve |  SE |  4th place conversion  
xe |  SE |  5th place conversion  
So far we have seen ways to move sumti around within a bridi, but the actual place structure of the selbri has always remained untouched. The conversion cmavo of selma'o SE are incorporated within the selbri itself, and produce a new selbri (called a converted selbri) with a different place structure. In particular, after the application of any SE cmavo, the number and purposes of the places remain the same, but two of them have been exchanged, the x1 place and another. Which place has been exchanged with x1 depends on the cmavo chosen. Thus, for example, when __se__ is used, the x1 place is swapped with the x2 place.
Note that the cmavo of SE begin with consecutive consonants in alphabetical order. There is no “1st place conversion” cmavo, because exchanging the x1 place with itself is a pointless maneuver.
Here are the place structures of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the destination of x2's going from x3 via x4 using x5
and _te klama_ :
> x1 is the origin and x2 the destination of x3 going via x4 using x5
and _ve klama_ :
> x1 is the route to x2 from x3 used by x4 going via x5
and _xe klama_ :
> x1 is the means in going to x2 from x3 via x4 employed by x5
Note that the place structure numbers in each case continue to be listed in the usual order, x1 to x5.
Consider the following pair of examples:
**Example 9.18. **
la | bastn. | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Boston |  | is-the-destination | of-me.  
Boston is my destination.  
---  
Boston is gone to by me.  
  

**Example 9.19. **
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I.  
To Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.18 and Example 9.19 mean the same thing, in the sense that there is a relationship of going with the speaker as the agent and Boston as the destination (and with unspecified origin, route, and means). Structurally, however, they are quite different. Example 9.18 has _la bastn._ in the x1 place and __mi__ in the x2 place of the selbri _se klama_ , and uses standard bridi order; Example 9.19 has __mi__ in the x1 place and _la bastn._ in the x2 place of the selbri __klama__ , and uses a non-standard order.
The most important use of conversion is in the construction of descriptions. A description is a sumti which begins with a cmavo of selma'o LA or LE, called the descriptor, and contains (in the simplest case) a selbri. We have already seen the descriptions _le dargu_ and _le karce_. To this we could add:
**Example 9.20. **
le | klama  
---|---  
the go-er, the one who goes  
---  
  

In every case, the description is about something which fits into the x1 place of the selbri. In order to get a description of a destination (that is, something fitting the x2 place of __klama__), we must convert the selbri to _se klama_ , whose x1 place is a destination. The result is
**Example 9.21. **
le | se | klama  
---|---|---  
the destination gone to by someone  
---  
  

Likewise, we can create three more converted descriptions:
**Example 9.22. **
le | te | klama  
---|---|---  
the origin of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.23. **
le | ve | klama  
---|---|---  
the route of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.24. **
le | xe | klama  
---|---|---  
the means by which someone goes  
---  
  

Example 9.23 does not mean “the route” plain and simple: that is _le pluta_ , using a different selbri. It means a route that is used by someone for an act of __klama__ ; that is, a journey with origin and destination. A “road” on Mars, on which no one has traveled or is ever likely to, may be called _le pluta_ , but it cannot be _le ve klama_ , since there exists no one for whom it is _le ve klama be fo da_ (the route taken in an actual journey by someone [da]).
When converting selbri that are more complex than a single brivla, it is important to realize that the scope of a SE cmavo is only the following brivla (or equivalent unit). In order to convert an entire tanru, it is necessary to enclose the tanru in __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets:
**Example 9.25. **
mi | se | ke | blanu | zdani | [ke'e] | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [2nd-conversion] | ( | blue | house | ) | this-thing  
  

The place structure of _blanu zdani_ (blue house) is the same as that of __zdani__ , by the rule given in Section 9.1. The place structure of __zdani__ is:
> _ _zdani_ _ x1 is a house/nest/lair/den for inhabitant x2
The place structure of _se ke blanu zdani [ke'e]_ is therefore:
> x1 is the inhabitant of the blue house (etc.) x2
Consequently, Example 9.25 means:
> I am the inhabitant of the blue house which is this thing.
Conversion applied to only part of a tanru has subtler effects which are explained in Section 5.11.
It is grammatical to convert a selbri more than once with SE; later (inner) conversions are applied before earlier (outer) ones. For example, the place structure of _se te klama_ is achieved by exchanging the x1 and x2 place of _te klama_ , producing:
> x1 is the destination and x2 is the origin of x3 going via x4 using x5
On the other hand, _te se klama_ has a place structure derived from swapping the x1 and x3 places of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the origin of x2's going to x3 via x4 using x5
which is quite different. However, multiple conversions like this are never necessary. Arbitrary scrambling of places can be achieved more easily and far more intelligibly with FA tags, and only a single conversion is ever needed in a description.
(Although no one has made any real use of it, it is perhaps worth noting that compound conversions of the form _setese_ , where the first and third cmavo are the same, effectively swap the two given places while leaving the others, including x1, alone: _setese_ (or equivalently _tesete_) swap the x2 and x3 places, whereas _texete_ (or _xetexe_) swap the x3 and x5 places.)

## 5.11. Conversion of simple selbri
Conversion is the process of changing a selbri so that its places appear in a different order. This is not the same as labeling the sumti with the cmavo of FA, as mentioned in Section 5.7, and then rearranging the order in which the sumti are spoken or written. Conversion transforms the selbri into a distinct, though closely related, selbri with renumbered places.
In Lojban, conversion is accomplished by placing a cmavo of selma'o SE before the selbri:
**Example 5.109. **
mi | prami | do  
---|---|---  
I love you.  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 5.110. **
do | se | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---  
You | [swap x1 and x2] | love | me.  
You are loved by me.  
---  
  

Conversion is fully explained in Section 9.4. For the purposes of this chapter, the important point about conversion is that it applies only to the following simple selbri. When trying to convert a tanru, therefore, it is necessary to be careful! Consider Example 5.111:
**Example 5.111. **
la | .alis. | cu | cadzu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | is-a-walker | type-of-goer-to | the | market.  
That-named | Alice |  | walkingly | goes-to | the | market.  
Alice walks to the market.  
---  
  

To convert this sentence so that _le zarci_ is in the x1 place, one correct way is:
**Example 5.112. **
le | zarci | cu | se  
---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-a-[swap x1/x2]  
The | market |  |   
ke | cadzu | klama | [ke'e] | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | walker | type-of-goer-to | ) | that-named | Alice.  
| is-walkingly | gone-to-by |  | that-named | Alice.  
  

The __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets cause the entire tanru to be converted by the __se__ , which would otherwise convert only __cadzu__ , leading to:
**Example 5.113. **
le | zarci | cu | se | cadzu  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | (is-a-[swap x1/x2] | walker)  
The | market |  |  | is-a-walking-surface  
klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
  

whatever that might mean. An alternative approach, since the place structure of _cadzu klama_ is that of __klama__ alone, is to convert only the latter:
**Example 5.114. **
le | zarci | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice.  
  

But the tanru in Example 5.114 may or may not have the same meaning as that in Example 5.111; in particular, because __cadzu__ is not converted, there is a suggestion that although Alice is the goer, the market is the walker. With a different sumti as x1, this seemingly odd interpretation might make considerable sense:
**Example 5.115. **
la | djan. | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice  
  

suggests that Alice is going to John, who is a moving target.
There is an alternative type of conversion, using the cmavo __jai__ of selma'o JAI optionally followed by a modal or tense construction. Grammatically, such a combination behaves exactly like conversion using SE. More details can be found in Section 9.12.
