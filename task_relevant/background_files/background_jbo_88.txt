## 13.7. Attitudinal modifiers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ga'i |  [galtu] |  hauteur; rank |  equal rank |  meekness; lack of rank  
---|---|---|---|---  
le'o |  |  aggressive |  passive |  defensive  
vu'e |  [vrude] |  virtue (__zabna__) |  |  sin (__mabla__)  
se'i |  [sevzi] |  self-orientation |  |  other-orientation  
ri'e |  [zifre] |  release |  restraint |  control  
fu'i |  [frili] |  with help; easily |  without help |  with opposition; with difficulty  
be'u |  |  lack/need |  presence/satisfaction |  satiation  
se'a |  [sevzi] |  self-sufficiency |  |  dependency  
It turned out that, once we had devised the six emotion categories, we also recognized some other commonalities among emotions. These tended to fit nicely on scales of their own, but generally tend not to be thought of as separate emotions. Some of these are self-explanatory, some need to be placed in context. Some of these tend to go well with only a few of the attitudinals, others go with nearly all of them. To really understand these modifiers, try to use them in combination with one or two of the attitudinals found in Section 13.2 and Section 13.3, and see what emotional pictures you can build:
The cmavo __ga'i__ expresses the scale used to indicate condescension or polite deference; it is not respect in general, which is __.io__. Whatever it is attached to is marked as being below (for __ga'i__) or above (for __ga'inai__) the speaker's rank or social position. Note that it is always the referent, not the speaker or listener, who is so marked: in order to mark the listener, the listener must appear in the sentence, as with _doi ga'inai_ , which can be appended to a statement addressed to a social superior.
**Example 13.48. **
ko | ga'inai | nenri | klama | le | mi | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You-imperative | [low-rank!] | enter-type-of | come-to | the | of-me | house.  
I would be honored if you would enter my residence.  
---  
  

Note that imperatives in Lojban need not be imperious! Corresponding examples with __ga'icu'i__ and __ga'i__ :
**Example 13.49. **
ko | ga'icu'i | nenri | klama | le | mi | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You-imperative | [equal-rank!] | enter-type-of | come-to | the | of-me | house.  
Come on in to my place.  
---  
  

**Example 13.50. **
ko | ga'i | nenri | klama | le | mi | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You-imperative | [high-rank!] | enter-type-of | come-to | the | of-me | house.  
You! Get inside!  
---  
  

Since __ga'i__ expresses the relative rank of the speaker and the referent, it does not make much sense to attach it to __mi__ , unless the speaker is using __mi__ to refer to a group (as in English “we”), or a past or future version of himself with a different rank.
It is also possible to attach __ga'i__ to a whole bridi, in which case it expresses the speaker's superiority to the event the bridi refers to:
**Example 13.51. **
ga'i | le | xarju | pu | citka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[High-rank!] | the | pig | [past] | eats.  
The pig ate (which is an event beneath my notice).  
---  
  

When used without being attached to any bridi, __ga'i__ expresses the speaker's superiority to things in general, which may represent an absolute social rank: _ga'icai_ is an appropriate opening word for an emperor's address from the throne.
The cmavo __le'o__ represents the scale of aggressiveness. We seldom overtly recognize that we are feeling aggressive or defensive, but perhaps in counseling sessions, a psychologist might encourage someone to express these feelings on this scale. And football teams could be urged on by their coach using _ro'ole'o_. __le'o__ is also useful in threats as an alternative to _o'onai_ , which expresses anger.
The cmavo __vu'e__ represents ethical virtue or its absence. An excess of almost any emotion is usually somewhat “sinful” in the eyes of most ethical systems. On the other hand, we often feel virtuous about our feelings – what we call righteous indignation might be _o'onaivu'e_. Note that this is distinct from lack of guilt: __.u'unai__.
The cmavo __se'i__ expresses the difference between selfishness and generosity, for example (in combination with __.au__):
**Example 13.52. **
.ause'i  
---  
[desire-self]  
I want it!  
---  
  

**Example 13.53. **
.ause'inai  
---  
[desire-other]  
I want you to have it!  
---  
  

In both cases, the English “it” is vague, reflecting the absence of a bridi. Example 13.52 and Example 13.53 are pure expressions of attitude. Analogously, _.uuse'i_ is self-pity, whereas _.uuse'inai_ is pity for someone else.
The modifier __ri'e__ indicates emotional release versus emotional control. “I will not let him know how angry I am”, you say to yourself before entering the room. The Lojban is much shorter:
**Example 13.54. **
.o'onai | ri'enai  
---|---  
[anger] | [control]  
  

On the other hand, __ri'e__ can be used by itself to signal an emotional outburst.
The cmavo __fu'i__ may express a reason for feeling the way we do, as opposed to a feeling in itself; but it is a reason that is more emotionally determined than most. For example, it could show the difference between the mental discomfort mentioned in Section 13.6 when it is felt on an easy test, as opposed to on a hard test. When someone gives you a back massage, you could use _.o'ufu'i_ to show appreciation for the assistance in your comfort.
The cmavo __be'u__ expresses, roughly speaking, whether the emotion it modifies is in response to something you don't have enough of, something you have enough of, or something you have too much of. It is more or less the attitudinal equivalent of the subjective quantifier cmavo __mo'a__ , __rau__ , and __du'e__ (these belong to selma'o PA, and are discussed in Section 18.8). For example,
**Example 13.55. **
.uiro'obe'unai  
---  
[Yay-physical-enough!]  
  

might be something you say after a large meal which you enjoyed.
Like all modifiers, __be'u__ can be used alone:
**Example 13.56. **
le | cukta | be'u | cu | zvati | ma  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | book | [Needed!] |  | is-at-location | [what-sumti?]  
Where's the book? I need it!  
---  
  

Lastly, the modifier __se'a__ shows whether the feeling is associated with self-sufficiency or with dependence on others.
**Example 13.57. **
.e'ese'a  
---  
[I-can-self-sufficient!]  
I can do it all by myself!  
---  
  

is something a Lojban-speaking child might say. On the other hand,
**Example 13.58. **
.e'ese'anai  
---  
[I-can-dependent]  
I can do it if you help me.  
---  
  

from the same child would indicate a (hopefully temporary) loss of self-confidence. It is also possible to negate the __e'e__ in Example 13.54 and Example 13.55, leading to:
**Example 13.59. **
.e'enaise'a  
---  
[I-can't-self-sufficient]  
I can't do it if you insist on “helping” me!  
---  
  

and
**Example 13.60. **
.e'enaise'anai  
---  
[I-can't-dependent]  
I can't do it by myself!  
---  
  

Some of the emotional expressions may seem too complicated to use. They might be for most circumstances. It is likely that most combinations will never get used. But if one person uses one of these expressions, another person can understand (as unambiguously as the expresser intends) what emotion is being expressed. Most probably as the system becomes well-known and internalized by Lojban-speakers, particular attitudinal combinations will come to be standard expressions (if not cliches) of emotion.

## 12.11. Eliding KE and KEhE rafsi from lujvo
People constructing lujvo usually want them to be as short as possible. To that end, they will discard any cmavo they regard as niceties. The first such cmavo to get thrown out are usually __ke__ and __ke'e__ , the cmavo used to structure and group tanru. We can usually get away with this, because the interpretation of the tertau with __ke__ and __ke'e__ missing is less plausible than that with the cmavo inserted, or because the distinction isn't really important.
For example, in __bakrecpa'o__ , meaning “beefsteak”, the veljvo is
**Example 12.49. **
[ke] | bakni | rectu | [ke'e] | panlo  
---|---|---|---|---  
( | bovine | meat | ) | slice  
  

because of the usual Lojban left-grouping rule. But there doesn't seem to be much difference between that veljvo and
**Example 12.50. **
bakni | ke | rectu | panlo | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
bovine | ( | meat | slice | )  
  

On the other hand, the lujvo __zernerkla__ , meaning “to sneak in”, almost certainly was formed from the veljvo
**Example 12.51. **
zekri | ke | nenri | klama | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
crime | ( | inside | go | )  
to go within, criminally  
---  
  

because the alternative,
**Example 12.52. **
[ke] | zekri | nenri | [ke'e] | klama  
---|---|---|---|---  
( | crime | inside | ) | go  
  

doesn't make much sense. (To go to the inside of a crime? To go into a place where it is criminal to be inside – an interpretation almost identical with Example 12.51 anyway?)
There are cases, however, where omitting a KE or KEhE rafsi can produce another lujvo, equally useful. For example, _xaskemcakcurnu_ means “oceanic shellfish”, and has the veljvo
**Example 12.53. **
xamsi |  | ke | calku | curnu  
---|---|---|---|---  
ocean | type-of | ( | shell | worm | )  
  

(“worm” in Lojban refers to any invertebrate), but _xasycakcurnu_ has the veljvo
**Example 12.54. **
[ke] | xamsi | calku | [ke'e] |  | curnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | ocean | shell | ) | type-of | worm  
  

and might refer to the parasitic worms that infest clamshells.
Such misinterpretation is more likely than not in a lujvo starting with _sel-_ (from __se__), _nal-_ (from __na'e__) or _tol-_ (from __to'e__): the scope of the rafsi will likeliest be presumed to be as narrow as possible, since all of these cmavo normally bind only to the following brivla or __ke__ … __ke'e__ group. For that reason, if we want to modify an entire lujvo by putting __se__ , __na'e__ or __to'e__ before it, it's better to leave the result as two words, or else to insert __ke__ , than to just stick the SE or NAhE rafsi on.
It is all right to replace the phrase _se klama_ with __selkla__ , and the places of __selkla__ are exactly those of _se klama_. But consider the related lujvo __dzukla__ , meaning “to walk to somewhere”. It is a symmmetrical lujvo, derived from the veljvo _cadzu klama_ as follows:
**Example 12.55. **
__cadzu__ : c1 walks on surface c2 using limbs c3
__klama__ : k1 goes to k2 from k3 via route k4 using k5
__dzukla__ : c1=k1 walks to k2 from k3 via route k4 using limbs k5=c3 on surface c2
  

We can swap the k1 and k2 places using _se dzukla_ , but we cannot directly make _se dzukla_ into _seldzukla_ , which would represent the veljvo _selcadzu klama_ and plausibly mean something like “to go to a walking surface”. Instead, we would need _selkemdzukla_ , with an explicit rafsi for __ke__. Similarly, _nalbrablo_ (from _na'e barda bloti_) means “non-big boat”, whereas _na'e brablo_ means “other than a big boat”.
If the lujvo we want to modify with SE has a seltau already starting with a SE rafsi, we can take a shortcut. For instance, __gekmau__ means “happier than”, while _selgekmau_ means “making people happier than, more enjoyable than, more of a 'se gleki' than”. If something is less enjoyable than something else, we can say it is _se selgekmau_.
But we can also say it is _selselgekmau_. Two __se__ cmavo in a row cancel each other (_se se gleki_ means the same as just __gleki__), so there would be no good reason to have _selsel_ in a lujvo with that meaning. Instead, we can feel free to interpret _selsel-_ as _selkemsel-_. The rafsi combinations _terter-_ , _velvel-_ and _xelxel-_ work in the same way.
Other SE combinations like _selter-_ , although they might conceivably mean _se te_ , more than likely should be interpreted in the same way, namely as _se ke te_ , since there is no need to re-order places in the way that _se te_ provides. (See Section 9.4.)

## 11.4. Property abstractions
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ka |  NU |  property abstractor  
---|---|---  
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
The things described by _le nu_ descriptions (or, to put it another way, the things of which __nu__ selbri may correctly be predicated) are only moderately “abstract”. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is “the property of being blue”, or “the property of being a go-er”? They are what logicians call “intensions”. If John has a heart, then “the property of having a heart” is an abstract object which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,
**Example 11.21. **
la | djan. | cu | se risna | zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-as-heart | something-unspecified.  
John has a heart.  
---  
  

has the same truth conditions as
**Example 11.22. **
la | djan. | cu | ckaji  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-the-property  
le | ka | se risna | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | having-as-heart | something.  
John has the property of having a heart.  
---  
  

(The English word “have” frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban properties: things are said to “have” properties, but this is not the same sense of “have” as in “I have money”, which is possession.)
Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:
**Example 11.23. **
do | cnino | mi | le | ka | xunre | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-new | to-me | in-the-quality-of-the | property-of | being-red.  
You are new to me in redness.  
---  
  

(The English suffix “-ness” often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix “-ity”.)
We can also move the property description to the x1 place of Example 11.23, producing:
**Example 11.24. **
le | ka | do | xunre | [kei] | cu | cnino | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | property-of | your | being-red |  |  | is-new | to me.  
Your redness is new to me.  
---  
  

It would be suitable to use Example 11.23 and Example 11.24 to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.
There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:
**Example 11.25. **
ka | mi | prami | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | me | loving | something-unspecified  
  

is quite different from
**Example 11.26. **
ka | [zo'e] | prami | mi | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | something-unspecified | loving | me  
  

In particular, sentences like Example 11.27 and Example 11.28 are quite different in meaning:
**Example 11.27. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami  
---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X)  
I love John more than I love George.  
---  
  

**Example 11.28. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka |  | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property of | (X | loves | me).  
John loves me more than George loves me.  
---  
  

The “X” used in the glosses of Example 11.27 through Example 11.28 as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in Section 11.2. Instead, the cmavo __ce'u__ of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)
Therefore, an explicit equivalent of Example 11.27, with no ellipsis, is:
**Example 11.29. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami | ce'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X).  
  

and of Example 11.28 is:
**Example 11.30. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | ce'u | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (X | loves | me).  
  

This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:
**Example 11.31. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of |  | giving | the | horse  
  

into
**Example 11.32. **
le | ka | ce'u | dunda | le | xirma |  | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | someone-unspecified | )  
the property of being a giver of the horse  
---  
  

which is the most natural interpretation of Example 11.31, versus
**Example 11.33. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma |  | ce'u | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (someone-unspecified | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | X | )  
the property of being one to whom the horse is given  
---  
  

which is also a possible interpretation.
It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction. Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri __bridi__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _bridi_ _ x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction) among arguments (sequence/set) x3
The place structure of __ka__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> _ _ka_ _ x1 is a property of (the bridi)

## 7.11. Abstraction focus pro-sumti: _ce'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __ce'u__ is used within abstraction bridi, particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo __ka__. Abstractions, including the uses of __ce'u__ , are discussed in full in Chapter 11.
In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using __ce'u__. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly between:
**Example 7.71. **
le | ka | ce'u | gleki  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | being-happy)  
the property of being happy  
---  
happiness  
  

and
**Example 7.72. **
le | ka | gleki | ce'u  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (being-happy-about | X)  
the property of being that which someone is happy about

---  
  

has the same truth conditions as
**Example 11.22. **
la | djan. | cu | ckaji  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-the-property  
le | ka | se risna | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | having-as-heart | something.  
John has the property of having a heart.  
---  
  

(The English word “have” frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban properties: things are said to “have” properties, but this is not the same sense of “have” as in “I have money”, which is possession.)
Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:
**Example 11.23. **
do | cnino | mi | le | ka | xunre | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-new | to-me | in-the-quality-of-the | property-of | being-red.  
You are new to me in redness.  
---  
  

(The English suffix “-ness” often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix “-ity”.)
We can also move the property description to the x1 place of Example 11.23, producing:
**Example 11.24. **
le | ka | do | xunre | [kei] | cu | cnino | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | property-of | your | being-red |  |  | is-new | to me.  
Your redness is new to me.  
---  
  

It would be suitable to use Example 11.23 and Example 11.24 to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.
There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:
**Example 11.25. **
ka | mi | prami | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | me | loving | something-unspecified  
  

is quite different from
**Example 11.26. **
ka | [zo'e] | prami | mi | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | something-unspecified | loving | me  
  

In particular, sentences like Example 11.27 and Example 11.28 are quite different in meaning:
**Example 11.27. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami  
---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X)  
I love John more than I love George.  
---  
  

**Example 11.28. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka |  | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property of | (X | loves | me).  
John loves me more than George loves me.  
---  
  

The “X” used in the glosses of Example 11.27 through Example 11.28 as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in Section 11.2. Instead, the cmavo __ce'u__ of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)
Therefore, an explicit equivalent of Example 11.27, with no ellipsis, is:
**Example 11.29. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami | ce'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X).  
  

and of Example 11.28 is:
**Example 11.30. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | ce'u | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (X | loves | me).  
  

This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:
**Example 11.31. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of |  | giving | the | horse  
  

into
**Example 11.32. **
le | ka | ce'u | dunda | le | xirma |  | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | someone-unspecified | )  
the property of being a giver of the horse  
---  
  

which is the most natural interpretation of Example 11.31, versus
**Example 11.33. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma |  | ce'u | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (someone-unspecified | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | X | )  
the property of being one to whom the horse is given  
---  
  

which is also a possible interpretation.
It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction. Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri __bridi__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _bridi_ _ x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction) among arguments (sequence/set) x3
The place structure of __ka__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> _ _ka_ _ x1 is a property of (the bridi)

## 9.16. CV'V cmavo of selma'o BAI with irregular forms
There are 65 cmavo of selma'o BAI, of which all but one (__do'e__ , discussed in Section 9.6), are derived directly from selected gismu. Of these 64 cmavo, 36 are entirely regular and have the form CV'V, where C is the first consonant of the corresponding gismu, and the Vs are the two vowels of the gismu. The remaining BAI cmavo, which are irregular in one way or another, are listed in the table below. The table is divided into sub-tables according to the nature of the exception; some cmavo appear in more than one sub-table, and are so noted.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 16.11. Using _naku_ outside a prenex
Let us consider the English sentence
**Example 16.79. **
Some children do not go to school.
  

We cannot express this directly with __na__ ; the apparently obvious translation
**Example 16.80. **
su'oda | poi | verba  
---|---|---  
At-least-one-X | which-are | child(ren)  
na | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
[false] | go-to | at-least-one-Y | which-are | school(s).  
  

when converted to the external negation form produces:
**Example 16.81. **
naku | zo'u | su'oda | poi | verba | cu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-false | that | some-which | are | children |   
klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---  
go-to | some-which | are | schools.  
All children don't go to some school (not just some children).  
---  
  

Lojban provides a negation form which more closely emulates natural language negation. This involves putting _naku_ before the selbri, instead of a __na__. _naku_ is clearly a contradictory negation, given its parallel with prenex bridi negation. Using _naku_ , Example 16.79 can be expressed as:
**Example 16.82. **
su'oda | poi | verba | naku | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | which-are | children | don't | go-to | some | which-are | schools.  
Some children don't go to a school.  
---  
  

Although it is not technically a sumti, _naku_ can be used in most of the places where a sumti may appear. We'll see what this means in a moment.
When you use _naku_ within a bridi, you are explicitly creating a negation boundary. As explained in Section 16.9, when a prenex negation boundary expressed by _naku_ moves past a quantifier, the quantifier has to be inverted. The same is true for _naku_ in the bridi proper. We can move _naku_ to any place in the sentence where a sumti can go, inverting any quantifiers that the negation boundary crosses. Thus, the following are equivalent to Example 16.82 (no good English translations exist):
**Example 16.83. **
su'oda | poi | verba | cu | klama | rode | poi | ckule | naku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For some children, for every school, they don't go to it.  
---  
  

**Example 16.84. **
su'oda | poi | verba | cu | klama | naku | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some children don't go to (some) school(s).  
---  
  

**Example 16.85. **
naku | roda | poi | verba | cu | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is false that all children go to some school(s).  
---  
  

In Example 16.83, we moved the negation boundary rightward across the quantifier of __de__ , forcing us to invert it. In Example 16.85 we moved the negation boundary across the quantifier of __da__ , forcing us to invert it instead. Example 16.84 merely switched the selbri and the negation boundary, with no effect on the quantifiers.
The same rules apply if you rearrange the sentence so that the quantifier crosses an otherwise fixed negation. You can't just convert the selbri of Example 16.82 and rearrange the sumti to produce
**Example 16.86. **
su'ode | poi | ckule | ku'o | naku | se | klama | roda | poi | verba  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some schools aren't gone-to-by every child.  
---  
  

or rather, Example 16.86 means something completely different from Example 16.82. Conversion with __se__ under _naku_ negation is not symmetric; not all sumti are treated identically, and some sumti are not invariant under conversion. Thus, internal negation with _naku_ is considered an advanced technique, used to achieve stylistic compatibility with natural languages.
It isn't always easy to see which quantifiers have to be inverted in a sentence. Example 16.82 is identical in meaning to:
**Example 16.87. **
su'o | verba | naku | klama | su'o | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | children | don't | go-to | some | school.  
  

but in Example 16.87, the bound variables __da__ and __de__ have been hidden.
It is trivial to export an internal bridi negation expressed with __na__ to the prenex, as we saw in Section 16.9; you just move it to the left end of the prenex. In comparison, it is non-trivial to export a _naku_ to the prenex because of the quantifiers. The rules for exporting _naku_ require that you export all of the quantified variables (implicit or explicit) along with _naku_ , and you must export them from left to right, in the same order that they appear in the sentence. Thus Example 16.82 goes into prenex form as:
**Example 16.88. **
su'oda | poi | verba | ku'o | naku  
---|---|---|---|---  
For-some-X | which | is-a-child, |  | it-is-not-the-case-that  
su'ode | poi | ckule | zo'u | da | klama | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-is-a-Y | which | is-a-school | such-that: | X | goes | to | Y.  
  

We can now move the _naku_ to the left end of the prenex, getting a contradictory negation that can be expressed with __na__ :
**Example 16.89. **
naku | roda | poi | verba  
---|---|---|---  
It-is-not-the-case-that | for-all-X's | which-are | children,  
su'ode | poi | ckule | zo'u | da | klama | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-is-a-Y | which-is | a-school | such-that: | X | goes-to | Y.  
  

from which we can restore the quantified variables to the sentence, giving:
**Example 16.90. **
naku | zo'u | roda | poi | verba | cu | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is not the case that all children go to some school.  
---  
  

or more briefly
**Example 16.91. **
ro | verba | cu | na | klama | su'o | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | children |  | [false] | go-to | some | school(s).  
  

As noted in Section 16.5, a sentence with two different quantified variables, such as Example 16.91, cannot always be converted with __se__ without first exporting the quantified variables. When the variables have been exported, the sentence proper can be converted, but the quantifier order in the prenex must remain unchanged:
**Example 16.92. **
roda | poi | verba | su'ode  
---|---|---|---  
for-all-X's | which-are | children, | there-is-a-Y  
poi | ckule | zo'u | de | na | se | klama | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
which | is-a-school | such-that: | Y |  |  | is-gone-to-by | X.  
  

While you can't freely convert with __se__ when you have two quantified variables in a sentence, you can still freely move sumti to either side of the selbri, as long as the order isn't changed. If you use __na__ negation in such a sentence, nothing special need be done. If you use _naku_ negation, then quantified variables that cross the negation boundary must be inverted.
Clearly, if all of Lojban negation was built on _naku_ negation instead of __na__ negation, logical manipulation in Lojban would be as difficult as in natural languages. In Section 16.12, for example, we'll discuss DeMorgan's Law, which must be used whenever a sumti with a logical connection is moved across a negation boundary.
Since _naku_ has the grammar of a sumti, it can be placed almost anywhere a sumti can go, including __be__ and __bei__ clauses; it isn't clear what these mean, and we recommend avoiding such constructs.
You can put multiple _naku_ compounds in a sentence, each forming a separate negation boundary. Two adjacent _naku_ compounds in a bridi are a double negative and cancel out:
**Example 16.93. **
mi naku naku le zarci cu klama
  

Other expressions using two _naku_ compounds may or may not cancel out. If there is no quantified variable between them, then the _naku_ compounds cancel.
Negation with internal _naku_ is clumsy and non-intuitive for logical manipulations, but then, so are the natural language features it is emulating.

## 8.10. Relative clauses within relative clauses
For the most part, these are straightforward and uncomplicated: a sumti that is part of a relative clause bridi may itself be modified by a relative clause:
**Example 8.81. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | blanu | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | is-blue |  | is-slow.  
  

However, an ambiguity can exist if __ke'a__ is used in a relative clause within a relative clause: does it refer to the outermost sumti, or to the sumti within the outer relative clause to which the inner relative clause is attached? The latter. To refer to the former, use a subscript on __ke'a__ :
**Example 8.82. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'axire | zbasu | ke'a | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | IT-sub-2 | built | IT |  | is-slow.  
The person who is in the room which he built is slow.  
---  
  

Here, the meaning of “IT-sub-2” is that sumti attached to the second relative clause, counting from the innermost, is used. Therefore, _ke'axipa_ (IT-sub-1) means the same as plain __ke'a__.
Alternatively, you can use a prenex (explained in full in Chapter 16), which is syntactically a series of sumti followed by the special cmavo __zo'u__ , prefixed to the relative clause bridi:
**Example 8.83. **
le | prenu | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'a | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | who | (IT | = | it1 | :  
ko'a | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'e | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | is-in | the | room | which | (IT | = | it2 | :  
ko'a | zbasu | ko'e | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | built | it2) |  | is-slow.  
  

Example 8.83 is more verbose than Example 8.82, but may be clearer, since it explicitly spells out the two __ke'a__ cmavo, each on its own level, and assigns them to the assignable cmavo __ko'a__ and __ko'e__ (explained in Section 7.5).

## 8.6. Relative clauses and descriptors
So far, this chapter has described the various kinds of relative clauses (including relative phrases). The list is now complete, and the rest of the chapter will be concerned with the syntax of sumti that include relative clauses. So far, all relative clauses have appeared directly after the sumti to which they are attached. This is the most common position (and originally the only one), but a variety of other placements are also possible which produce a variety of semantic effects.
There are actually three places where a relative clause can be attached to a description sumti: after the descriptor (__le__ , __lo__ , or whatever), after the embedded selbri but before the elidable terminator (which is __ku__), and after the __ku__. The relative clauses attached to descriptors that we have seen have occupied the second position. Thus Example 8.43, if written out with all elidable terminators, would appear as:
**Example 8.47. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | ku'o | ku | cu | klama | vau  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | (dog | which | (is-white | ) | ) |  | goes | .  
The dog which is white is going.  
---  
  

Here __ku'o__ is the terminator paired with __poi__ and __ku__ with __le__ , and __vau__ is the terminator of the whole bridi.
When a simple descriptor using __le__ , like _le gerku_ , has a relative clause attached, it is purely a matter of style and emphasis where the relative clause should go. Therefore, the following examples are all equivalent in meaning to Example 8.47:
**Example 8.48. **
le | poi | blabi | ku'o | gerku | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | such-that-( | it-is-white | ) | dog |  | goes.  
  

**Example 8.49. **
le | gerku | ku | poi | blabi | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | (dog | ) | which | is-white |  | goes.  
  

Example 8.47 will seem most natural to speakers of languages like English, which always puts relative clauses after the noun phrases they are attached to; Example 8.48, on the other hand, may seem more natural to Finnish or Chinese speakers, who put the relative clause first. Note that in Example 8.48, the elidable terminator __ku'o__ must appear, or the selbri of the relative clause (__blabi__) will merge with the selbri of the description (__gerku__), resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. The purpose of the form appearing in Example 8.49 will be apparent shortly.
As is explained in detail in Section 6.7, two different numbers (known as the “inner quantifier” and the “outer quantifier”) can be attached to a description. The inner quantifier specifies how many things the descriptor refers to: it appears between the descriptor and the description selbri. The outer quantifier appears before the descriptor, and specifies how many of the things referred to by the descriptor are involved in this particular bridi. In the following example,
**Example 8.50. **
re |  | le | mu | prenu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | of | the | five | persons |  | go-to | the | market.  
Two of the five people [that I have in mind] are going to the market.  
---  
  

__mu__ is the inner quantifier and __re__ is the outer quantifier. Now what is meant by attaching a relative clause to the sumti _re le mu prenu_? Suppose the relative clause is _poi ninmu_ (meaning “who are women”). Now the three possible attachment points discussed previously take on significance.
**Example 8.51. **
re |  | le | poi | ninmu | ku'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | of | the | such-that([they] | are-women | )  
mu | prenu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
five | persons |  | go-to | the | market.  
Two women out of the five persons go to the market.  
---  
  

**Example 8.52. **
re |  | le | mu | prenu | poi | ninmu | [ku] | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | of | the | (five | persons | which-( | are-women) | ) |  | go-to | the | market.  
Two of the five women go to the market.  
---  
  

**Example 8.53. **
re |  | le | mu | prenu | ku | poi | ninmu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(Two | of | the | five | persons | ) | which-( | are-women | ) | go-to | the | market.  
Two women out of the five persons go to the market.  
---  
  

As the parentheses show, Example 8.52 means that all five of the persons are women, whereas Example 8.53 means that the two who are going to the market are women. How do we remember which is which? If the relative clause comes after the explicit __ku__ , as in Example 8.53, then the sumti as a whole is qualified by the relative clause. If there is no __ku__ , or if the relative clause comes before an explicit __ku__ , then the relative clause is understood to apply to everything which the underlying selbri applies to.
What about Example 8.51? By convention, it means the same as Example 8.53, and it requires no __ku__ , but it does typically require a __ku'o__ instead. Note that the relative clause comes before the inner quantifier.
When __le__ is the descriptor being used, and the sumti has no explicit outer quantifier, then the outer quantifier is understood to be __ro__ (meaning “all”), as is explained in Section 6.7. Thus _le gerku_ is taken to mean “all of the things I refer to as dogs”, possibly all one of them. In that case, there is no difference between a relative clause after the __ku__ or before it. However, if the descriptor is __lo__ , the difference is quite important:
**Example 8.54. **
lo | prenu | ku | noi | blabi | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(Some | persons | ) | incidentally-which-( | are-white | ) | go-to | the | market.  
Some people, who are white, go to the market.  
---  
  

**Example 8.55. **
lo | prenu | noi | blabi | [ku] | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | (persons | incidentally-which | are-white | ) |  | go | to-the | market.  
Some of the people, who by the way are white, go to the market.  
---  
  

Both Example 8.54 and Example 8.55 tell us that one or more persons are going to the market. However, they make very different incidental claims. Now, what does _lo prenu noi blabi_ mean? Well, the default inner quantifier is __ro__ (meaning “all”), and the default outer quantifier is __su'o__ (meaning “at least one”). Therefore, we must first take all persons, then choose at least one of them. That one or more people will be going.
In Example 8.54, the relative clause described the sumti once the outer quantifier was applied: one or more people, who are white, are going. But in Example 8.55, the relative clause actually describes the sumti before the outer quantification is applied, so that it ends up meaning “First take all persons – by the way, they're all white”. But not all people are white, so the incidental claim being made here is false.
The safe strategy, therefore, is to always use __ku__ when attaching a __noi__ relative clause to a __lo__ descriptor. Otherwise we may end up claiming far too much.
When the descriptor is __la__ , indicating that what follows is a selbri used for naming, then the positioning of relative clauses has a different significance. A relative clause inside the __ku__ , whether before or after the selbri, is reckoned part of the name; a relative clause outside the __ku__ is not. Therefore,
**Example 8.56. **
mi | viska | la | nanmu | poi | terpa | le | ke'a | xirma | [ku]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | that-named-( | man | which | fears | the | of-IT | horse | ).  
I see Man Afraid Of His Horse.  
---  
  

says that the speaker sees a person with a particular name, who does not necessarily fear any horses, whereas
**Example 8.57. **
mi | viska | la | nanmu | ku | poi | terpa | le | ke'a | xirma.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | that-named-( | Man | ) | which | fears | the | of-IT | horse.  
I see the person named “Man” who is afraid of his horse.  
---  
  

refers to one (or more) of those named “Man”, namely the one(s) who are afraid of their horses.
Finally, so-called indefinite sumti like _re karce_ , which means almost the same as _re lo karce_ (which in turn means the same as _re lo ro karce_), can have relative clauses attached; these are taken to be of the outside-the- __ku__ variety. Here is an example:
**Example 8.58. **
mi | ponse | re | karce | [ku] | poi | xekri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | two | cars |  | which-are | black.  
  

The restrictive relative clause only affects the two cars being affected by the main bridi, not all cars that exist. It is ungrammatical to try to place a relative clause within an indefinite sumti (that is, before an explicitly expressed terminating __ku__.) Use an explicit __lo__ instead.

## 9.9. Modal selbri
Consider the example:
**Example 9.55. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban  
bai | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
with-compeller | some-act-by | that-named | Frank.  
I speak in Lojban, under compulsion by Frank.  
---  
  

Example 9.55 has two modal sumti, using the modals __bau__ and __bai__. Suppose we wanted to specify the language explicitly but be vague about who's doing the compelling. We can simplify Example 9.55 to:
**Example 9.56. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban. | bai | [ku].  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban | under-compulsion |   
  

In Example 9.56, the elidable terminator __ku__ has taken the place of the sumti which would normally follow __bai__. Alternatively, we could specify the one who compels but keep the language vague:
**Example 9.57. **
mi | tavla | bau | [ku]  
---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-some-language |   
bai | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
under-compulsion-by | some-act-by | that-named | Frank.  
  

We are also free to move the modal-plus- __ku__ around the bridi:
**Example 9.58. **
bau | [ku] | bai | ku | mi | tavla  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
In-some-language |  | under-compulsion |  | I | speak.  
  

An alternative to using __ku__ is to place the modal cmavo right before the selbri, following the __cu__ which often appears there. When a modal is present, the __cu__ is almost never necessary.
**Example 9.59. **
mi | bai | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | compelledly | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

In this use, the modal is like a tanru modifier semantically, although grammatically it is quite distinct. Example 9.59 is very similar in meaning to:
**Example 9.60. **
mi | se bapli | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | compelledly | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

The __se__ conversion is needed because _bapli tavla_ would be a “compeller type of speaker” rather than a “compelled (by someone) type of speaker”, which is what a _bai tavla_ is.
If the modal preceding a selbri is constructed using __fi'o__ , then __fe'u__ is required to prevent the main selbri and the modal selbri from colliding:
**Example 9.61. **
mi | fi'o | kanla | fe'u | viska | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | with | eye |  | see | you.  
I see you with my eye(s).  
---  
  

There are two other uses of modals. A modal can be attached to a pair of bridi-tails that have already been connected by a logical, non-logical, or modal connection (see Chapter 14 for more on logical and non-logical connections):
**Example 9.62. **
mi | bai | ke | ge | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | under-compulsion | ( | both | go | to-the | market  
gi | cadzu | le | bisli | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk | on-the | ice | ).  
Under compulsion, I both go to the market and walk on the ice.  
---  
  

Here the __bai__ is spread over both _klama le zarci_ and _cadzu le bisli_ , and the _ge ... gi_ represents the logical connection “both-and” between the two.
Similarly, a modal can be attached to multiple sentences that have been combined with __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ , which are explained in more detail in Section 19.2:
**Example 9.63. **
bai | tu'e | mi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Under-compulsion | [start] | I | go | to-the | market.  
.i | mi | cadzu | le | bisli | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| I | walk | on-the | ice | [end].  
  

means the same thing as Example 9.62.
Note: Either BAI modals or _fi'o-_ plus-selbri modals may correctly be used in any of the constructions discussed in this section.

## 9.4. Conversion: SE
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
se |  SE |  2nd place conversion  
---|---|---  
te |  SE |  3rd place conversion  
ve |  SE |  4th place conversion  
xe |  SE |  5th place conversion  
So far we have seen ways to move sumti around within a bridi, but the actual place structure of the selbri has always remained untouched. The conversion cmavo of selma'o SE are incorporated within the selbri itself, and produce a new selbri (called a converted selbri) with a different place structure. In particular, after the application of any SE cmavo, the number and purposes of the places remain the same, but two of them have been exchanged, the x1 place and another. Which place has been exchanged with x1 depends on the cmavo chosen. Thus, for example, when __se__ is used, the x1 place is swapped with the x2 place.
Note that the cmavo of SE begin with consecutive consonants in alphabetical order. There is no “1st place conversion” cmavo, because exchanging the x1 place with itself is a pointless maneuver.
Here are the place structures of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the destination of x2's going from x3 via x4 using x5
and _te klama_ :
> x1 is the origin and x2 the destination of x3 going via x4 using x5
and _ve klama_ :
> x1 is the route to x2 from x3 used by x4 going via x5
and _xe klama_ :
> x1 is the means in going to x2 from x3 via x4 employed by x5
Note that the place structure numbers in each case continue to be listed in the usual order, x1 to x5.
Consider the following pair of examples:
**Example 9.18. **
la | bastn. | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Boston |  | is-the-destination | of-me.  
Boston is my destination.  
---  
Boston is gone to by me.  
  

**Example 9.19. **
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I.  
To Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.18 and Example 9.19 mean the same thing, in the sense that there is a relationship of going with the speaker as the agent and Boston as the destination (and with unspecified origin, route, and means). Structurally, however, they are quite different. Example 9.18 has _la bastn._ in the x1 place and __mi__ in the x2 place of the selbri _se klama_ , and uses standard bridi order; Example 9.19 has __mi__ in the x1 place and _la bastn._ in the x2 place of the selbri __klama__ , and uses a non-standard order.
The most important use of conversion is in the construction of descriptions. A description is a sumti which begins with a cmavo of selma'o LA or LE, called the descriptor, and contains (in the simplest case) a selbri. We have already seen the descriptions _le dargu_ and _le karce_. To this we could add:
**Example 9.20. **
le | klama  
---|---  
the go-er, the one who goes  
---  
  

In every case, the description is about something which fits into the x1 place of the selbri. In order to get a description of a destination (that is, something fitting the x2 place of __klama__), we must convert the selbri to _se klama_ , whose x1 place is a destination. The result is
**Example 9.21. **
le | se | klama  
---|---|---  
the destination gone to by someone  
---  
  

Likewise, we can create three more converted descriptions:
**Example 9.22. **
le | te | klama  
---|---|---  
the origin of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.23. **
le | ve | klama  
---|---|---  
the route of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.24. **
le | xe | klama  
---|---|---  
the means by which someone goes  
---  
  

Example 9.23 does not mean “the route” plain and simple: that is _le pluta_ , using a different selbri. It means a route that is used by someone for an act of __klama__ ; that is, a journey with origin and destination. A “road” on Mars, on which no one has traveled or is ever likely to, may be called _le pluta_ , but it cannot be _le ve klama_ , since there exists no one for whom it is _le ve klama be fo da_ (the route taken in an actual journey by someone [da]).
When converting selbri that are more complex than a single brivla, it is important to realize that the scope of a SE cmavo is only the following brivla (or equivalent unit). In order to convert an entire tanru, it is necessary to enclose the tanru in __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets:
**Example 9.25. **
mi | se | ke | blanu | zdani | [ke'e] | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [2nd-conversion] | ( | blue | house | ) | this-thing  
  

The place structure of _blanu zdani_ (blue house) is the same as that of __zdani__ , by the rule given in Section 9.1. The place structure of __zdani__ is:
> _ _zdani_ _ x1 is a house/nest/lair/den for inhabitant x2
The place structure of _se ke blanu zdani [ke'e]_ is therefore:
> x1 is the inhabitant of the blue house (etc.) x2
Consequently, Example 9.25 means:
> I am the inhabitant of the blue house which is this thing.
Conversion applied to only part of a tanru has subtler effects which are explained in Section 5.11.
It is grammatical to convert a selbri more than once with SE; later (inner) conversions are applied before earlier (outer) ones. For example, the place structure of _se te klama_ is achieved by exchanging the x1 and x2 place of _te klama_ , producing:
> x1 is the destination and x2 is the origin of x3 going via x4 using x5
On the other hand, _te se klama_ has a place structure derived from swapping the x1 and x3 places of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the origin of x2's going to x3 via x4 using x5
which is quite different. However, multiple conversions like this are never necessary. Arbitrary scrambling of places can be achieved more easily and far more intelligibly with FA tags, and only a single conversion is ever needed in a description.
(Although no one has made any real use of it, it is perhaps worth noting that compound conversions of the form _setese_ , where the first and third cmavo are the same, effectively swap the two given places while leaving the others, including x1, alone: _setese_ (or equivalently _tesete_) swap the x2 and x3 places, whereas _texete_ (or _xetexe_) swap the x3 and x5 places.)

## 5.11. Conversion of simple selbri
Conversion is the process of changing a selbri so that its places appear in a different order. This is not the same as labeling the sumti with the cmavo of FA, as mentioned in Section 5.7, and then rearranging the order in which the sumti are spoken or written. Conversion transforms the selbri into a distinct, though closely related, selbri with renumbered places.
In Lojban, conversion is accomplished by placing a cmavo of selma'o SE before the selbri:
**Example 5.109. **
mi | prami | do  
---|---|---  
I love you.  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 5.110. **
do | se | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---  
You | [swap x1 and x2] | love | me.  
You are loved by me.  
---  
  

Conversion is fully explained in Section 9.4. For the purposes of this chapter, the important point about conversion is that it applies only to the following simple selbri. When trying to convert a tanru, therefore, it is necessary to be careful! Consider Example 5.111:
**Example 5.111. **
la | .alis. | cu | cadzu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | is-a-walker | type-of-goer-to | the | market.  
That-named | Alice |  | walkingly | goes-to | the | market.  
Alice walks to the market.  
---  
  

To convert this sentence so that _le zarci_ is in the x1 place, one correct way is:
**Example 5.112. **
le | zarci | cu | se  
---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-a-[swap x1/x2]  
The | market |  |   
ke | cadzu | klama | [ke'e] | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | walker | type-of-goer-to | ) | that-named | Alice.  
| is-walkingly | gone-to-by |  | that-named | Alice.  
  

The __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets cause the entire tanru to be converted by the __se__ , which would otherwise convert only __cadzu__ , leading to:
**Example 5.113. **
le | zarci | cu | se | cadzu  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | (is-a-[swap x1/x2] | walker)  
The | market |  |  | is-a-walking-surface  
klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
  

whatever that might mean. An alternative approach, since the place structure of _cadzu klama_ is that of __klama__ alone, is to convert only the latter:
**Example 5.114. **
le | zarci | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice.  
  

But the tanru in Example 5.114 may or may not have the same meaning as that in Example 5.111; in particular, because __cadzu__ is not converted, there is a suggestion that although Alice is the goer, the market is the walker. With a different sumti as x1, this seemingly odd interpretation might make considerable sense:
**Example 5.115. **
la | djan. | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice  
  

suggests that Alice is going to John, who is a moving target.
There is an alternative type of conversion, using the cmavo __jai__ of selma'o JAI optionally followed by a modal or tense construction. Grammatically, such a combination behaves exactly like conversion using SE. More details can be found in Section 9.12.

# Chapter 8. Relative Clauses, Which Make sumti Even More Complicated
## 8.1. What are you pointing at?
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
poi |  NOI |  restrictive relative clause introducer  
---|---|---  
ke'a |  GOhA |  relative pro-sumti  
ku'o |  KUhO |  relative clause terminator  
Let us think about the problem of communicating what it is that we are pointing at when we are pointing at something. In Lojban, we can refer to what we are pointing at by using the pro-sumti __ti__ if it is nearby, or __ta__ if it is somewhat further away, or __tu__ if it is distant. (Pro-sumti are explained in full in Chapter 7.)
However, even with the assistance of a pointing finger, or pointing lips, or whatever may be appropriate in the local culture, it is often hard for a listener to tell just what is being pointed at. Suppose one is pointing at a person (in particular, in the direction of his or her face), and says:
**Example 8.1. **
ti | cu | barda  
---|---|---  
This-one |  | is-big.  
  

What is the referent of __ti__? Is it the person? Or perhaps it is the person's nose? Or even (for __ti__ can be plural as well as singular, and mean “these ones” as well as “this one”) the pores on the person's nose?
To help solve this problem, Lojban uses a construction called a “relative clause”. Relative clauses are usually attached to the end of sumti, but there are other places where they can go as well, as explained later in this chapter. A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable terminator __ku'o__ (of selma'o KUhO). As you might suppose, __noi__ is a cmavo of selma'o NOI; however, first we will discuss the cmavo __poi__ , which also belongs to selma'o NOI.
In between the __poi__ and the __ku'o__ appears a full bridi, with the same syntax as any other bridi. Anywhere within the bridi of a relative clause, the pro-sumti __ke'a__ (of selma'o KOhA) may be used, and it stands for the sumti to which the relative clause is attached (called the “relativized sumti”). Here are some examples before we go any further:
**Example 8.2. **
ti | poi | ke'a | prenu | ku'o | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | such-that-( | IT | is-a-person | ) |  | is-large.  
This thing which is a person is big.  
---  
This person is big.  
  

**Example 8.3. **
ti | poi | ke'a | nazbi | ku'o | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | such-that-( | IT | is-a-nose | ) |  | is-large.  
This thing which is a nose is big.  
---  
This nose is big.  
  

**Example 8.4. **
ti | poi | ke'a | nazbi |  | kapkevna | ku'o | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | such-that-( | IT | is-a-nose | type-of | skin-hole | ) |  | is-big.  
These things which are nose-pores are big.  
---  
These nose-pores are big.  
  

In the literal translations throughout this chapter, the word “IT”, capitalized, is used to represent the cmavo __ke'a__. In each case, it serves to represent the sumti (in Example 8.2 through Example 8.4, the cmavo __ti__) to which the relative clause is attached.
Of course, there is no reason why __ke'a__ needs to appear in the x1 place of a relative clause bridi; it can appear in any place, or indeed even in a sub-bridi within the relative clause bridi. Here are two more examples:
**Example 8.5. **
tu | poi | le | mlatu | pu | lacpu | ke'a | ku'o | cu | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-distant-thing | such-that-( | the | cat | [past] | drags | IT | ) |  | is-a-rat.  
That thing which the cat dragged is a rat.  
---  
What the cat dragged is a rat.  
  

**Example 8.6. **
ta | poi | mi | djica | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-thing | such-that-( | I | desire | the | event-of(  
mi | ponse | ke'a | [kei] | ku'o | cu | bloti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | own | IT | ) | ) |  | is-a-boat.  
That thing that I want to own is a boat.  
---  
  

In Example 8.6, __ke'a__ appears in an abstraction clause (abstractions are explained in Chapter 11) within a relative clause.
Like any sumti, __ke'a__ can be omitted. The usual presumption in that case is that it then falls into the x1 place:
**Example 8.7. **
ti | poi | nazbi | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | which | is-a-nose |  | is-big.  
  

almost certainly means the same thing as Example 8.3. However, __ke'a__ can be omitted if it is clear to the listener that it belongs in some place other than x1:
**Example 8.8. **
tu | poi | le | mlatu | pu | lacpu | cu | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-distant-thing | which | the | cat | [past] | drags |  | is-a-rat  
  

is equivalent to Example 8.4.
As stated before, __ku'o__ is an elidable terminator, and in fact it is almost always elidable. Throughout the rest of this chapter, __ku'o__ will not be written in any of the examples unless it is absolutely required: thus, Example 8.2 can be written:
**Example 8.9. **
ti | poi | prenu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---  
That | which | is-a-person |  | is-big.  
That person is big.  
---  
  

without any change in meaning. Note that __poi__ is translated “which” rather than “such-that” when __ke'a__ has been omitted from the x1 place of the relative clause bridi. The word “which” is used in English to introduce English relative clauses: other words that can be used are “who” and “that”, as in:
**Example 8.10. **
I saw a man who was going to the store.
  

and
**Example 8.11. **
The building that the school was located in is large.
  

In Example 8.10 the relative clause is “who was going to the store”, and in Example 8.11 it is “that the school was located in”. Sometimes “who”, “which”, and “that” are used in literal translations in this chapter in order to make them read more smoothly.

## 16.5. Dropping the prenex
It isn't really necessary for every Lojban bridi involving variables to have a prenex on the front. In fact, none of the examples we've seen so far required prenexes at all! The rule for dropping the prenex is simple: if the variables appear in the same order within the bridi as they did in the prenex, then the prenex is superfluous. However, any __ro__ or __poi__ appearing in the prenex must be transferred to the first occurrence of the variable in the main part of the bridi. Thus, Example 16.9 becomes just:
**Example 16.25. **
da | viska | mi  
---|---|---  
There-is-an-X-which | sees | me.  
Something sees me.  
---  
  

and Example 16.23 becomes:
**Example 16.26. **
ro | da | poi | gerku | cu | vasxu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X | which | is-a-dog, |  | it-breathes.  
Every dog breathes.  
---  
  

You might well suppose, then, that the purpose of the prenex is to allow the variables in it to appear in a different order than the bridi order, and that would be correct. Consider
**Example 16.27. **
ro | da | poi | prenu | ku'o | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X | which | is-a-person, |  | there-is-a-Y  
poi | gerku | ku'o | zo'u | de | batci | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
which | is-a-dog |  | : | Y | bites | X.  
  

The prenex of Example 16.27 is like that of Example 16.18 (but with relative clauses): it notes that the following bridi is true of every person with respect to some dog, not necessarily the same dog for each. But in the main bridi part, the __de__ appears before the __da__. Therefore, the true translation is
**Example 16.28. **
Every person is bitten by some dog (or other).
  

If we tried to omit the prenex and move the __ro__ and the relative clauses into the main bridi, we would get:
**Example 16.29. **
de | poi | gerku | cu | batci | ro | da | poi | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-a-Y | which | is-a-dog |  | which-bites | every | X | which | is-a-person  
Some dog bites everyone.  
---  
  

which has the structure of Example 16.19: it says that there is a dog (call him Fido) who bites, has bitten, or will bite every person that has ever existed! We can safely rule out Fido's existence, and say that Example 16.29 is false, while agreeing to Example 16.27.
Even so, Example 16.27 is most probably false, since some people never experience dogbite. Examples like Example 16.27 and Example 16.23 (might there be some dogs which never have breathed, because they died as embryos?) indicate the danger in Lojban of universal claims even when restricted. In English we are prone to say that “Everyone says” or that “Everybody does” or that “Everything is” when in fact there are obvious counterexamples which we are ignoring for the sake of making a rhetorical point. Such statements are plain falsehoods in Lojban, unless saved by a context (such as tense) which implicitly restricts them.
How can we express Example 16.27 in Lojban without a prenex? Since it is the order in which variables appear that matters, we can say:
**Example 16.30. **
ro | da | poi | prenu | cu | se | batci | de | poi | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Every | X | which | is-a-person |  |  | is-bitten-by | some-Y | which | is-a-dog.  
  

using the conversion operator __se__ (explained in Section 5.11) to change the selbri __batci__ (“bites”) into _se batci_ (“is bitten by”). The translation given in Example 16.28 uses the corresponding strategy in English, since English does not have prenexes (except in strained “logician's English”). This implies that a sentence with both a universal and an existential variable can't be freely converted with __se__ ; one must be careful to preserve the order of the variables.
If a variable occurs more than once, then any __ro__ or __poi__ decorations are moved only to the first occurrence of the variable when the prenex is dropped. For example,
**Example 16.31. **
di | poi | prenu | zo'u  
---|---|---|---  
There-is-a-Z | which | is-a-person | :  
ti | xarci | di | di  
---|---|---|---  
this-thing | is-a-weapon | for-use-against-Z | by-Z  
This is a weapon for someone to use against himself/herself.  
---  
  

(in which __di__ is used rather than __da__ just for variety) loses its prenex as follows:
**Example 16.32. **
ti | xarci | di | poi | prenu | ku'o | di  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | is-a-weapon-for-use-against | some-Z | which | is-a-person |  | by-Z.  
  

As the examples in this section show, dropping the prenex makes for terseness of expression often even greater than that of English (Lojban is meant to be an unambiguous language, not necessarily a terse or verbose one), provided the rules are observed.

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  
I'm worn out by your continuous talking.  
---  
  

**Example 13.27. **
.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  
I'm putting you to bed.  
---  
  

**Example 13.28. **
.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.  
---  
  

**Example 13.29. **
.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  
I hope I feel better tomorrow!  
---  
  

**Example 13.30. **
.au | mi | sipna  
---|---|---  
[desire] | I | sleep.  
I want to sleep.  
---  
  

**Example 13.31. **
.a'ucu'i | do | pante  
---|---|---  
[no-interest] | you | complain.  
I have no interest in your complaints.  
---  
  

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  
I feel up to dealing with you.  
---  
  

**Example 13.34. **
.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  
I should fill the car's gas tank.  
---  
  

**Example 13.35. **
.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  
---|---|---|---  
[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  
Please take care of yourself!  
---  
  

**Example 13.36. **
.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  
I suggest going to the park.

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  
I can't believe you thought you could fool me.  
---  
  

**Example 13.38. **
do | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  
I blame you for not coming home.  
---  
  

**Example 13.39. **
.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  
le | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  
It's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  
---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.
