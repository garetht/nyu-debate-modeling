## 13.16. Tentative conclusion
The exact ramifications of the indicator system in actual usage are unknown. There has never been anything like it in natural language before. The system provides great potential for emotional expression and transcription, from which significant Sapir-Whorf effects can be anticipated. When communicating across cultural boundaries, where different indicators are often used for the same emotion, accidental offense can be avoided. If we ever ran into an alien race, a culturally neutral language of emotion could be vital. (A classic example, taken from the science fiction of Larry Niven, is to imagine speaking Lojban to the carnivorous warriors called Kzinti, noting that a human smile bares the teeth, and could be seen as an intent to attack.) And for communicating emotions to computers, when we cannot identify all of the signals involved in subliminal human communication (things like body language are also cultural), a system like this is needed.
We have tried to err on the side of overkill. There are distinctions possible in this system that no one may care to make in any culture. But it was deemed more neutral to overspecify and let usage decide, than to choose a limited set and constrain emotional expression. For circumstances in which even the current indicator set is not enough, it is possible using the cmavo __sei__ , explained in Section 19.12, to create metalinguistic comments that act like indicators.
We envision an evolutionary development. At this point, the system is little more than a mental toy. Many of you who read this will try playing around with various combinations of indicators, trying to figure out what emotions they express and when the expressions might be useful. You may even find an expression for which there currently is no good English word and start using it. Why not, if it helps you express your feelings?
There will be a couple dozen of these used pretty much universally – mostly just simple attitudinals with, at most, intensity markers. These are the ones that will quickly be expressed at the subconscious level. But every Lojbanist who plays with the list will bring in a couple of new words. Poets will paint emotional pictures, and people who identify with those pictures will use the words so created for their own experiences.
Just as a library of tanru is built up, so will a library of attitudes be built. Unlike the tanru, though, the emotional expressions are built on some fairly nebulous root emotions – words that cannot be defined with the precision of the gismu. The emotion words of Lojban will very quickly take on a life of their own, and the outline given here will evolve into a true system of emotions.
There are several theories as to the nature of emotion, and they change from year to year as we learn more about ourselves. Whether or not Lojban's additive/scalar emotional model is an accurate model for human emotions, it does support the linguistic needs for expressing those emotions. Researchers may learn more about the nature of human emotions by exploring the use of the system by Lojban speakers. They also may be able to use the Lojban system as a means for more clearly recording emotions.
The full list of scales and attitudes will probably not be used until someone speaks the language from birth. Until then, people will use the attitudes that are important to them. In this way, we counter cultural bias – if a culture is prone to recognizing and/or expressing certain emotions more than others, its members will use only those out of the enormous set available. If a culture hides certain emotions, its members simply won't express them.
Perhaps native Lojban speakers will be more expressively clear about their emotions than others. Perhaps they will feel some emotions more strongly than others in ways that can be correlated with the word choices; any difference from the norms of other cultures could be significant. Psychologists have devised elaborate tests for measuring attitudes and personality; this may be the easiest area in which to detect any systematic cultural effect of the type sought to confirm Sapir-Whorf, simply because we already have tools in existence to test it. Because Lojban is unique among languages in having such extensive and expressive indicators, it is likely that a Sapir-Whorf effect will occur and will be recognized.
It is unlikely that we will know the true potential of a system like this one until and unless we have children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking environment. We learn too many cultural habits in the realm of emotional communication “at our mother's knee”. Such children will have a Lojban system that has stronger reinforcement than any typical culture system. The second generation of such children, then, could be said to be the start of a true Lojbanic culture.
We shouldn't need to wait that long to detect significant effects. Emotion is so basic to our lives that even a small change or improvement in emotional communication would have immediately noticeable effects. Perhaps it will be the case that the most important contribution of our “logical language” will be in the non-logical realm of emotion!

## 7.15. lujvo based on pro-sumti
There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See Section 7.16 for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.
Thus __donta'a__ , meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted as _tavla be do_ , and would have the place structure
**Example 7.76. **
> t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
  

since `t2` (the addressee) is already known to be __do__.
On the other hand, the lujvo __donma'o__ , literally “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal pronoun”, would be interpreted as _cmavo be zo do_ , and have the place structure:
**Example 7.77. **
> c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
  

since both the `c2` place (the grammatical class) and the `c3` place (the meaning) are obvious from the context __do__.
An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the __fo'a__ series is to express lujvo which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An example would be:
**Example 7.78. **
fo'a | goi | le | kulnrsu,omi | .i | lo | fo'arselsanga  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x6 | stands-for | the | Finnish-culture | . | An | x6-song.  
  

Finally, lujvo involving __zi'o__ are also possible, and are fully discussed in Chapter 12. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for __zi'o__ as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a _se pinxe be zi'o_ , the lujvo corresponding to this is _zilrelselpinxe_ (deleting the second place of _se pinxe_). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that _zilpavypinxe_ has the same place structure as _zilrelselpinxe_ , and _lo zilpavypinxe_ , like _lo zilrelselpinxe_ , refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ , __du__ , and __bu'a__ also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for _du-_ based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.

## 10.14. Story time
Making strict use of the conventions explained in Section 10.13 would be intolerably awkward when a story is being told. The time at which a story is told by the narrator is usually unimportant to the story. What matters is the flow of time within the story itself. The term “story” in this section refers to any series of statements related in more-or-less time-sequential order, not just a fictional one.
Lojban speakers use a different set of conventions, commonly called “story time”, for inferring tense within a story. It is presumed that the event described by each sentence takes place some time more or less after the previous ones. Therefore, tenseless sentences are implicitly tensed as “what happens next”. In particular, any sticky time setting is advanced by each sentence.
The following mini-story illustrates the important features of story time. A sentence-by-sentence explication follows:
**Example 10.93. **
pu | zu | ki | ku | ne'i | ki | le | kevna  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[past] | [long] | [sticky] | [,] | [inside] | [sticky] | the | cave,  
le | ninmu | goi | ko'a | zutse | le | rokci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | woman | defined-as | she-1 | sat-on | the | rock  
Long ago, in a cave, a woman sat on a rock.  
---  
  

**Example 10.94. **
.i | ko'a | citka | loi | kanba | rectu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| She-1 | eat-(tenseless) | some-of-the-mass-of | goat | flesh.  
She was eating goat's meat.  
---  
  

**Example 10.95. **
.i | ko'a | pu | jukpa | ri | le | mudyfagri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| She | [past] | cook | the-last-mentioned | by-method-the | wood-fire.  
She had cooked the meat over a wood fire.  
---  
  

**Example 10.96. **
.i | lei | rectu | cu | zanglare  
---|---|---|---|---  
| The-mass-of | flesh |  | is-(favorable)-warm.  
The meat was pleasantly warm.  
---  
  

**Example 10.97. **
.i | le | labno | goi | ko'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
| The | wolf | defined-as | it-2  
ba | za | ki | nenri | klama | le | kevna  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[future] | [medium] | [sticky] | within | came | to-the | cave.  
A while later, a wolf came into the cave.  
---  
  

**Example 10.98. **
.i | ko'e | lebna | lei | rectu | ko'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| It-2 | takes-(tenseless) | the-mass-of | flesh | from-her-1.  
It took the meat from her.  
---  
  

**Example 10.99. **
.i | ko'e | bartu | klama  
---|---|---|---  
| It-2 | out | ran  
It ran out.  
---  
  

Example 10.93 sets both the time (long ago) and the place (in a cave) using __ki__ , just like the sentence sequences in Section 10.13. No further space cmavo are used in the rest of the story, so the place is assumed to remain unchanged. The English translation of Example 10.93 is marked for past tense also, as the conventions of English storytelling require: consequently, all other English translation sentences are also in the past tense. (We don't notice how strange this is; even stories about the future are written in past tense!) This conventional use of past tense is not used in Lojban narratives.
Example 10.94 is tenseless. Outside story time, it would be assumed that its event happens simultaneously with that of Example 10.93, since a sticky tense is in effect; the rules of story time, however, imply that the event occurs afterwards, and that the story time has advanced (changing the sticky time set in Example 10.93).
Example 10.95 has an explicit tense. This is taken relative to the latest setting of the sticky time; therefore, the event of Example 10.95 happens before that of Example 10.94. It cannot be determined if Example 10.95 happens before or after Example 10.93.
Example 10.96 is again tenseless. Story time was not changed by the flashback in Example 10.95, so Example 10.96 happens after Example 10.94.
Example 10.97 specifies the future (relative to Example 10.96) and makes it sticky. So all further events happen after Example 10.97.
Example 10.98 and Example 10.99 are again tenseless, and so happen after Example 10.97. (Story time is changed.)
So the overall order is Example 10.93 \- Example 10.95 \- Example 10.94 \- Example 10.96 \- (medium interval) - Example 10.97 \- Example 10.98 \- Example 10.99. It is also possible that Example 10.95 happens before Example 10.93.
If no sticky time (or space) is set initially, the story is set at an unspecified time (or space): the effect is like that of choosing an arbitrary reference point and making it sticky. This style is common in stories that are jokes. The same convention may be used if the context specifies the sticky time sufficiently.

## 9.3. Tagging places: FA
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
fa |  FA |  tags x1 place  
---|---|---  
fe |  FA |  tags x2 place  
fi |  FA |  tags x3 place  
fo |  FA |  tags x4 place  
fu |  FA |  tags x5 place  
fi'a |  FA |  place structure question  
In sentences like Example 9.1, it is easy to get lost and forget which sumti falls in which place, especially if the sumti are more complicated than simple names or descriptions. The place structure tags of selma'o FA may be used to help clarify place structures. The five cmavo __fa__ , __fe__ , __fi__ , __fo__ , and __fu__ may be inserted just before the sumti in the x1 to x5 places respectively:
**Example 9.8. **
fa | mi | cu | klama | fe | la | bastn. | fi | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x1= | I |  | go | x2= | that-named | Boston | x3= | that-named | Atlanta  
fo | le | dargu | fu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
x4= | the | road | x5= | the | car.  
I go to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.8, the tag __fu__ before _le karce_ clarifies that _le karce_ occupies the x5 place of __klama__. The use of __fu__ tells us nothing about the purpose or meaning of the x5 place; it simply says that _le karce_ occupies it.
In Example 9.8, the tags are overkill; they serve only to make Example 9.1 even longer than it is. Here is a better illustration of the use of FA tags for clarification:
**Example 9.9. **
fa | mi | klama | fe | le | zdani | be | mi | be'o | poi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x1= | I | go | x2= | (the | house | of | me) |  | which  
nurma | vau | fi | la | nu,IORK.  
---|---|---|---|---  
is-rural |  | x3= | that-named | New-York.  
  

In Example 9.9, the place structure of __klama__ is as follows:
x1 | agent |  _ _mi_ _  
---|---|---  
x2 | destination |  _le zdani be mi be'o poi nurma vau_  
x3 | origin |  _la nu,IORK._  
x4 | route | (empty)  
x5 | means | (empty)  
The __fi__ tag serves to remind the hearer that what follows is in the x3 place of __klama__ ; after listening to the complex sumti occupying the x2 place, it's easy to get lost.
Of course, once the sumti have been tagged, the order in which they are specified no longer carries the burden of distinguishing the places. Therefore, it is perfectly all right to scramble them into any order desired, and to move the selbri to anywhere in the bridi, even the beginning:
**Example 9.10. **
klama | fa | mi | fi | la | .atlantas. | fu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
go | x1= | I | x3= | that-named | Atlanta | x5= | the | car  
fe | la | bastn. | fo | le | dargu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston | x4= | the | road.  
Go I from Atlanta using the car to Boston via the road.  
---  
  

Note that no __cu__ is permitted before the selbri in Example 9.10, because __cu__ separates the selbri from any preceding sumti, and Example 9.10 has no such sumti.
**Example 9.11. **
fu | le | karce | fo | le | dargu | fi | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x5= | the | car | x4= | the | road | x3= | that-named | Atlanta  
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I  
Using the car, via the road, from Atlanta to Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.11 exhibits the reverse of the standard bridi form seen in Example 9.1 and Example 9.8, but still means exactly the same thing. If the FA tags were left out, however, producing:
**Example 9.12. **
le | karce | le | dargu | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | car | to-the | road | from-that-named | Atlanta  
la | bastn. | cu | klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
via-that-named | Boston |  | goes | using-me.  
The car goes to the road from Atlanta, with Boston as the route, using me as a means of transport.  
---  
  

the meaning would be wholly changed, and in fact nonsensical.
Tagging places with FA cmavo makes it easy not only to reorder the places but also to omit undesirable ones, without any need for __zo'e__ or special rules about the x1 place:
**Example 9.13. **
klama | fi | la | .atlantas. | fe | la | bastn.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A-goer | x3= | that-named | Atlanta | x2= | that-named | Boston  
fu | le | karce  
---|---|---  
x5= | the | car.  
A goer from Atlanta to Boston using the car.  
---  
  

Here the x1 and x4 places are empty, and so no sumti are tagged with __fa__ or __fo__ ; in addition, the x2 and x3 places appear in reverse order.
What if some sumti have FA tags and others do not? The rule is that after a FA-tagged sumti, any sumti following it occupy the places numerically succeeding it, subject to the proviso that an already-filled place is skipped:
**Example 9.14. **
klama | fa | mi | la | bastn. | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go | x1= | I | x2=that-named | Boston | x3=that-named | Atlanta  
le | dargu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---  
x4=the | road | x5=the | car.  
Go I to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.14, the __fa__ causes __mi__ to occupy the x1 place, and then the following untagged sumti occupy in order the x2 through x5 places. This is the mechanism by which Lojban allows placing the selbri first while specifying a sumti for the x1 place.
Here is a more complex (and more confusing) example:
**Example 9.15. **
mi | klama | fi | la | .atlantas. | le | dargu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go | x3= | that-named | Atlanta, | the | road  
fe | la | bastn. | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston, | the | car.  
I go from Atlanta via the road to Boston using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.15, __mi__ occupies the x1 place because it is the first sumti in the sentence (and is before the selbri). The second sumti, _la .atlantas._ , occupies the x3 place by virtue of the tag __fi__ , and _le dargu_ occupies the x4 place as a result of following _la .atlantas._. Finally, _la bastn._ occupies the x2 place because of its tag __fe__ , and _le karce_ skips over the already-occupied x3 and x4 places to land in the x5 place.
Such a convoluted use of tags should probably be avoided except when trying for a literal translation of some English (or other natural-language) sentence; the rules stated here are merely given so that some standard interpretation is possible.
It is grammatically permitted to tag more than one sumti with the same FA cmavo. The effect is that of making more than one claim:
**Example 9.16. **
[fa] | la | rik. | fa | la | djein. | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[x1=] | that-named | Rick | x1= | that-named | Jane | goes-to  
[fe] | le | skina | fe | le | zdani | fe | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[x2=] | the | movie | x2= | the | house | x2= | the | office  
  

may be taken to say that both Rick and Jane go to the movie, the house, and the office, merging six claims into one. More likely, however, it will simply confuse the listener. There are better ways, involving logical connectives (explained in Chapter 14), to say such things in Lojban. In fact, putting more than one sumti into a place is odd enough that it can only be done by explicit FA usage: this is the motivation for the proviso above, that already-occupied places are skipped. In this way, no sumti can be forced into a place already occupied unless it has an explicit FA cmavo tagging it.
The cmavo __fi'a__ also belongs to selma'o FA, and allows Lojban users to ask questions about place structures. A bridi containing __fi'a__ is a question, asking the listener to supply the appropriate other member of FA which will make the bridi a true statement:
**Example 9.17. **
fi'a | do | dunda | [fe] | le | vi | rozgu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[what-place]? | you | give | x2= | the | nearby | rose  
In what way are you involved in the giving of this rose?  
---  
Are you the giver or the receiver of this rose?  
  

In Example 9.17, the speaker uses the selbri __dunda__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _dunda_ _ x1 gives x2 to x3
The tagged sumti _fi'a do_ indicates that the speaker wishes to know whether the sumti __do__ falls in the x1 or the x3 place (the x2 place is already occupied by _le rozgu_). The listener can reply with a sentence consisting solely of a FA cmavo: __fa__ if the listener is the giver, __fi__ if he/she is the receiver.
I have inserted the tag __fe__ in brackets into Example 9.17, but it is actually not necessary, because __fi'a__ does not count as a numeric tag; therefore, _le vi rozgu_ would necessarily be in the x2 place even if no tag were present, because it immediately follows the selbri.
There is also another member of FA, namely __fai__ , which is discussed in Section 9.12.

fai |  FA |  indefinite place  
Conversion is the regular Lojban process of moving around the places of a place structure. The cmavo of selma'o SE serve this purpose, exchanging the first place with one of the others:
**Example 10.162. **
mi | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | go-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.163. **
le | zarci | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-gone-to | by-me.  
  

It is also possible to bring a place that is specified by a sumti tcita (for the purposes of this chapter, a tense sumti tcita) to the front, by using __jai__ plus the tense as the grammatical equivalent of SE:
**Example 10.164. **
le | ratcu | cu | citka | le | cirla | vi | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | rat |  | eats | the | cheese | [short-distance] | the | park.  
The rat eats the cheese in the park.  
---  
  

**Example 10.165. **
le | panka | cu | jai vi | citka | le | cirla | fai | le | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | park |  | is-the-place-of | eating | the | cheese | by | the | rat.  
The park is where the rat eats the cheese.  
---  
  

In Example 10.165, the construction JAI+tense converts the location sumti into the first place. The previous first place has nowhere to go, since the location sumti is not a numbered place; however, it can be inserted back into the bridi with __fai__ , the indefinite member of selma'o FA.
(The other members of FA are used to mark the first, second, etc. places of a bridi explicitly:
**Example 10.166. **
fa mi cu klama fe le zarci
  

means the same as
**Example 10.167. **
fe le zarci cu klama fa mi
  

as well as the simple
**Example 10.168. **
mi cu klama le zarci
  

in which the place structure is determined by position.)
Like SE conversion, JAI+tense conversion is especially useful in descriptions with LE selma'o:
**Example 10.169. **
mi | viska | le | jai vi | citka | be | le | cirla  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | place-of | eating |  | the | cheese.  
  

Here the eater of the cheese is elided, so no __fai__ appears.
Of course, temporal tenses are also usable with JAI:
**Example 10.170. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | jai | ca | morsi | be | fai | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the |  | [present] | is-dead |  | of | that-named |  “John” | .  
I know the time of John's death.  
---  
I know when John died.

## 18.9. Approximation and inexact numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ji'i |  PA |  approximately  
---|---|---  
su'e |  PA |  at most  
su'o |  PA |  at least  
me'i |  PA |  less than  
za'u |  PA |  more than  
The cmavo __ji'i__ (of selma'o PA) is used in several ways to indicate approximate or rounded numbers. If it appears at the beginning of a number, the whole number is approximate:
**Example 18.60. **
ji'i | vo | no  
---|---|---  
approximation | four | zero  
approximately 40  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears in the middle of a number, all the digits following it are approximate:
**Example 18.61. **
vo | no | ji'i | mu | no  
---|---|---|---|---  
four | zero | approximation | five | zero  
roughly 4050 (where the “four thousand” is exact, but the “fifty” is approximate)  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears at the end of a number, it indicates that the number has been rounded. In addition, it can then be followed by a sign cmavo (__ma'u__ or __ni'u__), which indicate truncation towards positive or negative infinity respectively.
**Example 18.62. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation  
2.72 (rounded)  
---  
  

**Example 18.63. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i | ma'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation | positive-sign  
2.72 (rounded up)  
---  
  

**Example 18.64. **
re | pi | ze | pa | ji'i | ni'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | one | approximation | negative-sign  
2.71 (rounded down)  
---  
  

Example 18.62 through Example 18.64 are all approximations to __te'o__ (exponential e). __ji'i__ can also appear by itself, in which case it means “approximately the typical value in this context”.
The four cmavo __su'e__ , __su'o__ , __me'i__ , and __za'u__ , also of selma'o PA, express inexact numbers with upper or lower bounds:
**Example 18.65. **
mi | catlu | su'e | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-most | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.66. **
mi | catlu | su'o | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.67. **
mi | catlu | me'i | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | less-than | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.68. **
mi | catlu | za'u | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | more-than | two | persons  
  

Each of these is a subtly different claim: Example 18.66 is true of two or any greater number, whereas Example 18.68 requires three persons or more. Likewise, Example 18.65 refers to zero, one, or two; Example 18.67 to zero or one. (Of course, when the context allows numbers other than non-negative integers, _me'i re_ can be any number less than 2, and likewise with the other cases.) The exact quantifier, “exactly 2, neither more nor less” is just __re__. Note that _su'ore_ is the exact Lojban equivalent of English plurals.
If no number follows one of these cmavo, __pa__ is understood: therefore,
**Example 18.69. **
mi | catlu | su'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least-[one] | person  
  

is a meaningful claim.
Like the numbers in Section 18.8, all of these cmavo may be preceded by __pi__ to make the corresponding quantifiers for part of a whole. For example, __pisu'o__ means “at least some part of”. The quantifiers __ro__ , __su'o__ , __piro__ , and __pisu'o__ are particularly important in Lojban, as they are implicitly used in the descriptions introduced by the cmavo of selma'o LA and LE, as explained in Section 6.7. Descriptions in general are outside the scope of this chapter.

## 6.6. Quantified sumti
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ro |  PA |  all of/each of  
---|---|---  
su'o |  PA |  at least (one of)  
Quantifiers tell us how many: in the case of quantifiers with sumti, how many things we are talking about. In Lojban, quantifiers are expressed by numbers and mathematical expressions: a large topic discussed in some detail in Chapter 18. For the purposes of this chapter, a simplified treatment will suffice. Our examples will employ either the simple Lojban numbers __pa__ , __re__ , __ci__ , __vo__ , and __mu__ , meaning “one”, “two”, “three”, “four”, “five” respectively, or else one of four special quantifiers, two of which are discussed in this section and listed above. These four quantifiers are important because every Lojban sumti has either one or two of them implicitly present in it – which one or two depends on the particular kind of sumti. There is more explanation of implicit quantifiers later in this section. (The other two quantifiers, __piro__ and __pisu'o__ , are explained in Section 6.7.)
Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit quantifier. The purpose of this quantifier is to specify how many of the things referred to by the sumti are being talked about. Here are some simple examples contrasting sumti with and without explicit quantifiers:
**Example 6.30. **
do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---  
You | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

**Example 6.31. **
re | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
Two-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

The difference between Example 6.30 and Example 6.31 is the presence of the explicit quantifier __re__ in the latter example. Although __re__ by itself means “two”, when used as a quantifier it means “two-of”. Out of the group of listeners (the number of which isn't stated), two (we are not told which ones) are asserted to be “walkers on the ice”. Implicitly, the others (if any) are not walkers on the ice. In Lojban, you cannot say “I own three shoes” if in fact you own four shoes. Numbers need never be specified, but if they are specified they must be correct.
(This rule does not mean that there is no way to specify a number which is vague. The sentence
**Example 6.32. **
mi | ponse | su'o | ci | cutci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | at-least | three | shoes.  
  

is true if you own three shoes, or four, or indeed any larger number. More details on vague numbers appear in the discussion of mathematical expressions in Chapter 18.)
Now consider Example 6.30 again. How many of the listeners are claimed to walk on the ice? The answer turns out to be: all of them, however many that is. So Example 6.30 and Example 6.33:
**Example 6.33. **
ro | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
All-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

turn out to mean exactly the same thing. This is a safe strategy, because if one of my listeners doesn't turn out to be walking on the ice, I can safely claim that I didn't intend that person to be a listener! And in fact, all of the personal pro-sumti such as __mi__ and __mi'o__ and __ko__ obey the same rule. We say that personal pro-sumti have a so-called “implicit quantifier” of __ro__ (all). This just means that if no quantifier is given explicitly, the meaning is the same as if the implicit quantifier had been used.
Not all sumti have __ro__ as the implicit quantifier, however. Consider the quotation in:
**Example 6.34. **
mi | cusku | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say, “You walk on the ice.”  
---  
  

What is the implicit quantifier of the quotation _lu do cadzu le bisli li'u_? Surely not __ro__. If __ro__ were supplied explicitly, thus:
**Example 6.35. **
mi | cusku | ro | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | all-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

the meaning would be something like “I say every occurrence of the sentence 'You walk on the ice'”. Of course I don't say every occurrence of it, only some occurrences. One might suppose that Example 6.34 means that I express exactly one occurrence, but it is more Lojbanic to leave the number unspecified, as with other sumti. We can say definitely, however, that I say it at least once.
The Lojban cmavo meaning “at least” is __su'o__ , and if no ordinary number follows, __su'o__ means “at least once”. (See Example 6.32 for the use of __su'o__ with an ordinary number). Therefore, the explicitly quantified version of Example 6.34 is
**Example 6.36. **
mi | cusku | su'o | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | at-least-one-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say one or more instances of “You walk on the ice”.  
---  
I say “You walk on the ice”.  
  

If an explicit ordinary number such as __re__ were to appear, it would have to convey an exact expression, so
**Example 6.37. **
mi | cusku | re | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | two-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

means that I say the sentence exactly twice, neither more nor less.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 9.16. CV'V cmavo of selma'o BAI with irregular forms
There are 65 cmavo of selma'o BAI, of which all but one (__do'e__ , discussed in Section 9.6), are derived directly from selected gismu. Of these 64 cmavo, 36 are entirely regular and have the form CV'V, where C is the first consonant of the corresponding gismu, and the Vs are the two vowels of the gismu. The remaining BAI cmavo, which are irregular in one way or another, are listed in the table below. The table is divided into sub-tables according to the nature of the exception; some cmavo appear in more than one sub-table, and are so noted.

## 9.17. Complete table of BAI cmavo with rough English equivalents
The following table shows all the cmavo belonging to selma'o BAI, and has five columns. The first column is the cmavo itself; the second column is the gismu linked to it. The third column gives an English phrase which indicates the meaning of the cmavo; and the fourth column indicates its meaning when preceded by __se__.
For those cmavo with meaningful __te__ , __ve__ , and even __xe__ conversions (depending on the number of places of the underlying gismu), the meanings of these are shown on one or two extra rows following the primary row for that cmavo.
It should be emphasized that the place structures of the gismu control the meanings of the BAI cmavo. The English phrases shown here are only suggestive, and are often too broad or too narrow to correctly specify what the acceptable range of uses for the modal tag are.

## 14.13. Truth questions and connective questions
So far we have addressed only sentences which are statements. Lojban, like all human languages, needs also to deal with sentences which are questions. There are many ways of asking questions in Lojban, but some of these (like questions about quantity, tense, and emotion) are discussed in other chapters.
The simplest kind of question is of the type “Is it true that ...” where some statement follows. This type is called a “truth question”, and can be represented in English by Example 14.92:
**Example 14.92. **
Is it true that Fido is a dog?
Is Fido a dog?
  

Note the two formulations. English truth questions can always be formed by prefixing “Is is true that” to the beginning of a statement; there is also usually a more idiomatic way involving putting the verb before its subject. “Is Fido a dog?” is the truth question corresponding to “Fido is a dog”. In Lojban, the equivalent mechanism is to prefix the cmavo __xu__ (of selma'o UI) to the statement:
**Example 14.93. **
xu | la | faidon. | gerku  
---|---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that | that-named | Fido | is-a-dog?  
  

Example 14.92 and Example 14.93 are equivalent in meaning.
A truth question can be answered “yes” or “no”, depending on the truth or falsity, respectively, of the underlying statement. The standard way of saying “yes” in Lojban is __go'i__ and of saying “no” is __na__ __go'i__. (The reasons for this rule are explained in Section 7.6.) In answer to Example 14.93, the possible answers are:
**Example 14.94. **
go'i  
---  
Fido is a dog.  
---  
  

and
**Example 14.95. **
nago'i  
---  
Fido is not a dog.  
---  
  

Some English questions seemingly have the same form as the truth questions so far discussed. Consider
**Example 14.96. **
Is Fido a dog or a cat?
  

Superficially, Example 14.96 seems like a truth question with the underlying statement:
**Example 14.97. **
Fido is a dog or a cat.
  

By translating Example 14.97 into Lojban and prefixing __xu__ to signal a truth question, we get:
**Example 14.98. **
xu | la | faidon. | gerku | gi'onai | mlatu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that | that-named | Fido | is-a-dog | or | is-a-cat | (but not both)?  
  

Given that Fido really is either a dog or a cat, the appropriate answer would be __go'i__ ; if Fido were a fish, the appropriate answer would be __na__ __go'i__.
But that is not what an English-speaker who utters Example 14.96 is asking! The true significance of Example 14.96 is that the speaker desires to know the truth value of either of the two underlying bridi (it is presupposed that only one is true).
Lojban has an elegant mechanism for rendering this kind of question which is very unlike that used in English. Instead of asking about the truth value of the connected bridi, Lojban users ask about the truth function which connects them. This is done by using a special question cmavo: there is one of these for each of the logical connective selma'o, as shown by the following table:
ge'i |  GA |  forethought connective question  
---|---|---  
gi'i |  GIhA |  bridi-tail connective question  
gu'i |  GUhA |  tanru forethought connective question  
je'i |  JA |  tanru connective question  
ji |  A |  sumti connective question  
(This list unfortunately departs from the pretty regularity of the other cmavo for logical connection. The two-syllable selma'o, GIhA and GUhA, make use of the cmavo ending in “-i” which is not used for a truth function, but __gi__ and __i__ were not available, and different cmavo had to be chosen. This table must simply be memorized, like most other non-connective cmavo assignments.)
One correct translation of Example 14.96 employs a question gihek:
**Example 14.99. **
la | .alis. | gerku | gi'i | mlatu  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | is-a-dog | [truth-function?] | is-a-cat?  
  

Here are some plausible answers:
**Example 14.100. **
nagi'e  
---  
Alice is not a dog and is a cat.  
---  
  

**Example 14.101. **
gi'enai  
---  
Alice is a dog and is not a cat.  
---  
  

**Example 14.102. **
nagi'enai  
---  
Alice is not a dog and is not a cat.  
---  
  

**Example 14.103. **
nagi'o  
---  
gi'onai  
Alice is a dog or is a cat but not both (I'm not saying which).  
---  
  

Example 14.103 is correct but uncooperative.
As usual, Lojban questions are answered by filling in the blank left by the question. Here the blank is a logical connective, and therefore it is grammatical in Lojban to utter a bare logical connective without anything for it to connect.
The answer __gi'e__ , meaning that Alice is a dog and is a cat, is impossible in the real world, but for:
**Example 14.104. **
do | djica | tu'a | loi | ckafi  
---|---|---|---|---  
You | desire | something-about | a-mass-of | coffee  
ji | loi | tcati  
---|---|---  
[truth-function?] | a-mass-of | tea?  
Do you want coffee or tea?  
---  
  

the answer __e__ , meaning that I want both, is perfectly plausible, if not necessarily polite.
The forethought questions __ge'i__ and __gu'i__ are used like the others, but ambiguity forbids the use of isolated forethought connectives as answers – they sound like the start of forethought-connected bridi. So although Example 14.105 is the forethought version of Example 14.104:
**Example 14.105. **
do | djica | tu'a | ge'i | loi | ckafi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | desire | something-about | [truth-function?] | a-mass-of | coffee  
gi | loi | tcati  
---|---|---  
[or] | a-mass-of | tea?  
  

the answer must be in afterthought form.
There are natural languages, notably Chinese, which employ the Lojbanic form of connective question. The Chinese sentence
**Example 14.106. **
_ni 3 zou3 hai2shi pao3_  
---  
You walk [or?] run?  
  

means “Do you walk or run?”, and is exactly parallel to the Lojban:
**Example 14.107. **
do | cadzu | gi'i | bajra  
---|---|---|---  
You | walk | [or?] | run?  
  

However, Chinese does not use logical connectives in the reply to such a question, so the resemblance, though striking, is superficial.
Truth questions may be used in bridi connection. This form of sentence is perfectly legitimate, and can be interpreted by using the convention that a truth question is true if the answer is “yes” and false if the answer is __no__. Analogously, an imperative sentence (involving the special pro-sumti __ko__ , which means “you” but marks the sentence as a command) is true if the command is obeyed, and false otherwise. A request of Abraham Lincoln's may be translated thus:
**Example 14.108. **
ganai | ti | ckafi | gi | ko | bevri | loi | tcati | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
If | this | is-coffee | then | [you!] | bring | a-mass-of | tea | to-me,  
.ije | ganai | ti | tcati | gi | ko | bevri | loi | ckafi | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | if | this | is-tea | then | [you!] | bring | a-mass-of | coffee | to-me.  
If this is coffee, bring me tea; but if this is tea, bring me coffee.  
---  
  

In logical terms, however, “but” is the same as “and”; the difference is that the sentence after a “but” is felt to be in tension or opposition to the sentence before it. Lojban represents this distinction by adding the discursive cmavo __ku'i__ (of selma'o UI), which is explained in Section 13.12, to the logical __.i__ __je__.)

za'i |  NU |  state abstractor  
Event abstractions with __nu__ suffice to express all kinds of events, whether long, short, unique, repetitive, or whatever. Lojban also has more finely discriminating machinery for talking about events, however. There are four other abstractors of selma'o NU for talking about four specific types of events, or four ways of looking at the same event.
An event considered as a point in time is called a “point-event”, or sometimes an “achievement”. (This latter word should be divorced, in this context, from all connotations of success or triumph.) A point-event can be extended in duration, but it is still a point-event if it is thought of as unitary, having no internal structure. The abstractor __mu'e__ means “point-event-of”:
**Example 11.17. **
le | mu'e | la | djan. | catra | la | djim. | cu | zekri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | point-event-of | (that-named | John | kills | that-named | Jim) |  | is-a-crime.  
John's killing Jim (considered as a point in time) is a crime.  
---  
  

An event considered as extended in time, and structured with a beginning, a middle containing one or more stages, and an end, is called a “process”. The abstractor __pu'u__ means “process-of”:
**Example 11.18. **
ca'o | le | pu'u | le | latmo | balje'a | cu | porpi | kei  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[continuitive] | the | process-of( | the | Latin | great-state |  | breaking-up | )  
so'i | je'atru | cu | selcatra  
---|---|---|---  
many | state-rulers |  | were-killed  
During the fall of the Roman Empire, many Emperors were killed.  
---  
  

An event considered as extended in time and cyclic or repetitive is called an “activity”. The abstractor __zu'o__ means “activity-of”:
**Example 11.19. **
mi | tatpi | ri'a | le | zu'o | mi | plipe  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-tired | because-of | the | activity-of | (I | jump).  
I am tired because I jump.  
---  
  

An event considered as something that is either happening or not happening, with sharp boundaries, is called a “state”. The abstractor __za'i__ means “state-of”:
**Example 11.20. **
le | za'i | mi | jmive | cu | ckape | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | state-of | (I | am-alive) |  | is-dangerous-to | you.  
My being alive is dangerous to you.  
---  
  

The abstractors in Example 11.17 through Example 11.20 could all have been replaced by __nu__ , with some loss of precision. Note that Lojban allows every sort of event to be viewed in any of these four ways:
  * the “state of running” begins when the runner starts and ends when the runner stops;
  * the “activity of running” consists of the cycle “lift leg, step forward, drop leg, lift other leg...” (each such cycle is a process, but the activity consists in the repetition of the cycle);
  * the “process of running” puts emphasis on the initial sprint, the steady speed, and the final slowdown;
  * the “achievement of running” is most alien to English, but sees the event of running as a single indivisible thing, like “Pheidippides' run from Marathon to Athens” (the original marathon).


Further information on types of events can be found in Section 11.12.
The four event type abstractors have the following place structures:
> __mu'e__ : x1 is a point event of (the bridi)
> __pu'u__ : x1 is a process of (the bridi) with stages x2
> __za'i__ : x1 is a continuous state of (the bridi) being true
> __zu'o__ : x1 is an activity of (the bridi) consisting of repeated actions x2

## 13.11. Evidentials
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ja'o |  [jalge] |  I conclude  
---|---|---  
ca'e |  |  I define  
ba'a |  [balvi] |  I expect |  I experience |  I remember  
su'a |  [sucta] |  I generalize |  |  I particularize  
ti'e |  [tirna] |  I hear (hearsay)  
ka'u |  [kulnu] |  I know by cultural means  
se'o |  [senva] |  I know by internal experience  
za'a |  [zgana] |  I observe  
pe'i |  [pensi] |  I opine  
ru'a |  [sruma] |  I postulate  
ju'a |  [jufra] |  I state  
Now we proceed from the attitudinal indicators and their relatives to the other, semantically unrelated, categories of indicators. The indicators known as “evidentials” show how the speaker came to say the utterance; i.e. the source of the information or the idea. Lojban's list of evidentials was derived from lists describing several American Indian languages. Evidentials are also essential to the constructed language Láadan, designed by the linguist and novelist Suzette Haden Elgin. Láadan's set of indicators was drawn on extensively in developing the Lojban indicator system.
It is important to realize, however, that evidentials are not some odd system used by some strange people who live at the other end of nowhere: although their English equivalents aren't single words, English-speakers have vivid notions of what constitutes evidence, and of the different kinds of evidence.
Like the attitudinal indicators, the evidentials belong to selma'o UI, and may be treated identically for grammatical purposes. Most of them are not usually considered scalar in nature, but a few have associated scales.
A bridi with an evidential in it becomes “indisputable”, in the sense that the speaker is saying “how it is with him or her”, which is beyond argument. Claims about one's own mental states may be true or false, but are hardly subject to other people's examination. If you say that you think, or perceive, or postulate such-and-such a predication, who can contradict you? Discourse that uses evidentials has therefore a different rhetorical flavor than discourse that does not; arguments tend to become what can be called dialogues or alternating monologues, depending on your prejudices.
Evidentials are most often placed at the beginning of sentences, and are often attached to the __i__ that separates sentences in connected discourse. It is in the nature of an evidential to affect the entire bridi in which it is placed: like the propositional attitude indicators, they strongly affect the claim made by the main bridi.
A bridi marked by __ja'o__ is a conclusion by the speaker based on other (stated or unstated) information or ideas. Rough English equivalents of __ja'o__ are “thus” and “therefore”.
A bridi marked by __ca'e__ is true because the speaker says so. In addition to definitions of words, __ca'e__ is also appropriate in what are called performatives, where the very act of speaking the words makes them true. An English example is “I now pronounce you husband and wife”, where the very act of uttering the words makes the listeners into husband and wife. A Lojban translation might be:
**Example 13.77. **
ca'e | le | re | do | cu | simxu | speni  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[I-define!] | the | two | of-you |  | are-mutual | spouses.  
  

The three scale positions of __ba'a__ , when attached to a bridi, indicate that it is based on the speaker's view of the real world. Thus __ba'a__ means that the statement represents a future event as anticipated by the speaker; __ba'acu'i__ , a present event as experienced by the speaker; __ba'anai__ , a past event as remembered by the speaker. It is accidental that this scale runs from future to past instead of past to future.
**Example 13.78. **
ba'acu'i | le | tuple | be | mi | cu | se cortu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[I-experience!] | the | leg | of | me |  | is-the-locus-of-pain.  
My leg hurts.  
---  
  

A bridi marked by __su'a__ is a generalization by the speaker based on other (stated or unstated) information or ideas. The difference between __su'a__ and __ja'o__ is that __ja'o__ suggests some sort of reasoning or deduction (not necessarily rigorous), whereas __su'a__ suggests some sort of induction or pattern recognition from existing examples (not necessarily rigorous).
The opposite point of the scale, __su'anai__ , indicates abduction, or drawing specific conclusions from general premises or patterns.
This cmavo can also function as a discursive (see Section 13.12), in which case __su'a__ means “abstractly” or “in general”, and __su'anai__ means “concretely” or “in particular”.
A bridi marked by __ti'e__ is relayed information from some source other than the speaker. There is no necessary implication that the information was relayed via the speaker's ears; what we read in a newspaper is an equally good example of __ti'e__ , unless we have personal knowledge of the content.
**Example 13.79. **
ti'e | la | .uengas | cu | zergau  
---|---|---|---|---  
[I-hear!] | Wenga |  | is-a-criminal-doer.  
I hear that Wenga is a crook.  
---  
  

A bridi marked by __ka'u__ is one held to be true in the speaker's cultural context, as a matter of myth or custom, for example. Such statements should be agreed on by a community of people – you cannot just make up your own cultural context – although “objectivity” in the sense of actual correspondence with the facts is certainly not required.
On the other hand, __se'o__ marks a bridi whose truth is asserted by the speaker as a result of an internal experience not directly available to others, such as a dream, vision, or personal revelation. In some cultures, the line between __ka'u__ and __se'o__ is fuzzy or even nonexistent.
A bridi marked by __za'a__ is based on perception or direct observation by the speaker. This use of “observe” is not connected with the Lojban “observative”, or bridi with the first sumti omitted. The latter has no explicit aspect, and could be a direct observation, a conclusion, an opinion, or other aspectual point of view.
**Example 13.80. **
za'a | do | tatpi  
---|---|---  
[I-observe!] | you | are-tired.  
I see you are tired.  
---  
  

A bridi marked by __pe'i__ is the opinion of the speaker. The form _pe'ipei_ is common, meaning “Is this your opinion?”. (Strictly, this should be _peipe'i_ , in accordance with the distinction explained in Example 13.69 through Example 13.71, but since __pe'i__ is not really a scale, there is no real difference between the two orders.)
**Example 13.81. **
pe'i | la | kartagos. | .ei | se daspo  
---|---|---|---|---  
[I-opine!] | that-named | Carthage | [obligation] | is-destroyed.  
In my opinion, Carthage should be destroyed.  
---  
  

A bridi marked by __ru'a__ is an assumption made by the speaker. This is similar to one possible use of __e'u__.
**Example 13.82. **
ru'a | doi | livinston.  
---|---|---  
[I-presume] | o | Livingstone.  
Dr. Livingstone, I presume? (A rhetorical question: Stanley knew who he was.)  
---  
  

Finally, the evidential __ju'a__ is used to avoid stating a specific basis for a statement. It can also be used when the basis for the speaker's statement is not covered by any other evidential. For the most part, using __ju'a__ is equivalent to using no evidential at all, but in question form it can be useful: _ju'apei_ means “What is the basis for your statement?” and serves as an evidential, as distinct from emotional, question.

## 9.4. Conversion: SE
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
se |  SE |  2nd place conversion  
---|---|---  
te |  SE |  3rd place conversion  
ve |  SE |  4th place conversion  
xe |  SE |  5th place conversion  
So far we have seen ways to move sumti around within a bridi, but the actual place structure of the selbri has always remained untouched. The conversion cmavo of selma'o SE are incorporated within the selbri itself, and produce a new selbri (called a converted selbri) with a different place structure. In particular, after the application of any SE cmavo, the number and purposes of the places remain the same, but two of them have been exchanged, the x1 place and another. Which place has been exchanged with x1 depends on the cmavo chosen. Thus, for example, when __se__ is used, the x1 place is swapped with the x2 place.
Note that the cmavo of SE begin with consecutive consonants in alphabetical order. There is no “1st place conversion” cmavo, because exchanging the x1 place with itself is a pointless maneuver.
Here are the place structures of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the destination of x2's going from x3 via x4 using x5
and _te klama_ :
> x1 is the origin and x2 the destination of x3 going via x4 using x5
and _ve klama_ :
> x1 is the route to x2 from x3 used by x4 going via x5
and _xe klama_ :
> x1 is the means in going to x2 from x3 via x4 employed by x5
Note that the place structure numbers in each case continue to be listed in the usual order, x1 to x5.
Consider the following pair of examples:
**Example 9.18. **
la | bastn. | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Boston |  | is-the-destination | of-me.  
Boston is my destination.  
---  
Boston is gone to by me.  
  

**Example 9.19. **
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I.  
To Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.18 and Example 9.19 mean the same thing, in the sense that there is a relationship of going with the speaker as the agent and Boston as the destination (and with unspecified origin, route, and means). Structurally, however, they are quite different. Example 9.18 has _la bastn._ in the x1 place and __mi__ in the x2 place of the selbri _se klama_ , and uses standard bridi order; Example 9.19 has __mi__ in the x1 place and _la bastn._ in the x2 place of the selbri __klama__ , and uses a non-standard order.
The most important use of conversion is in the construction of descriptions. A description is a sumti which begins with a cmavo of selma'o LA or LE, called the descriptor, and contains (in the simplest case) a selbri. We have already seen the descriptions _le dargu_ and _le karce_. To this we could add:
**Example 9.20. **
le | klama  
---|---  
the go-er, the one who goes  
---  
  

In every case, the description is about something which fits into the x1 place of the selbri. In order to get a description of a destination (that is, something fitting the x2 place of __klama__), we must convert the selbri to _se klama_ , whose x1 place is a destination. The result is
**Example 9.21. **
le | se | klama  
---|---|---  
the destination gone to by someone  
---  
  

Likewise, we can create three more converted descriptions:
**Example 9.22. **
le | te | klama  
---|---|---  
the origin of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.23. **
le | ve | klama  
---|---|---  
the route of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.24. **
le | xe | klama  
---|---|---  
the means by which someone goes  
---  
  

Example 9.23 does not mean “the route” plain and simple: that is _le pluta_ , using a different selbri. It means a route that is used by someone for an act of __klama__ ; that is, a journey with origin and destination. A “road” on Mars, on which no one has traveled or is ever likely to, may be called _le pluta_ , but it cannot be _le ve klama_ , since there exists no one for whom it is _le ve klama be fo da_ (the route taken in an actual journey by someone [da]).
When converting selbri that are more complex than a single brivla, it is important to realize that the scope of a SE cmavo is only the following brivla (or equivalent unit). In order to convert an entire tanru, it is necessary to enclose the tanru in __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets:
**Example 9.25. **
mi | se | ke | blanu | zdani | [ke'e] | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [2nd-conversion] | ( | blue | house | ) | this-thing  
  

The place structure of _blanu zdani_ (blue house) is the same as that of __zdani__ , by the rule given in Section 9.1. The place structure of __zdani__ is:
> _ _zdani_ _ x1 is a house/nest/lair/den for inhabitant x2
The place structure of _se ke blanu zdani [ke'e]_ is therefore:
> x1 is the inhabitant of the blue house (etc.) x2
Consequently, Example 9.25 means:
> I am the inhabitant of the blue house which is this thing.
Conversion applied to only part of a tanru has subtler effects which are explained in Section 5.11.
It is grammatical to convert a selbri more than once with SE; later (inner) conversions are applied before earlier (outer) ones. For example, the place structure of _se te klama_ is achieved by exchanging the x1 and x2 place of _te klama_ , producing:
> x1 is the destination and x2 is the origin of x3 going via x4 using x5
On the other hand, _te se klama_ has a place structure derived from swapping the x1 and x3 places of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the origin of x2's going to x3 via x4 using x5
which is quite different. However, multiple conversions like this are never necessary. Arbitrary scrambling of places can be achieved more easily and far more intelligibly with FA tags, and only a single conversion is ever needed in a description.
(Although no one has made any real use of it, it is perhaps worth noting that compound conversions of the form _setese_ , where the first and third cmavo are the same, effectively swap the two given places while leaving the others, including x1, alone: _setese_ (or equivalently _tesete_) swap the x2 and x3 places, whereas _texete_ (or _xetexe_) swap the x3 and x5 places.)

## 5.11. Conversion of simple selbri
Conversion is the process of changing a selbri so that its places appear in a different order. This is not the same as labeling the sumti with the cmavo of FA, as mentioned in Section 5.7, and then rearranging the order in which the sumti are spoken or written. Conversion transforms the selbri into a distinct, though closely related, selbri with renumbered places.
In Lojban, conversion is accomplished by placing a cmavo of selma'o SE before the selbri:
**Example 5.109. **
mi | prami | do  
---|---|---  
I love you.  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 5.110. **
do | se | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---  
You | [swap x1 and x2] | love | me.  
You are loved by me.  
---  
  

Conversion is fully explained in Section 9.4. For the purposes of this chapter, the important point about conversion is that it applies only to the following simple selbri. When trying to convert a tanru, therefore, it is necessary to be careful! Consider Example 5.111:
**Example 5.111. **
la | .alis. | cu | cadzu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | is-a-walker | type-of-goer-to | the | market.  
That-named | Alice |  | walkingly | goes-to | the | market.  
Alice walks to the market.  
---  
  

To convert this sentence so that _le zarci_ is in the x1 place, one correct way is:
**Example 5.112. **
le | zarci | cu | se  
---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-a-[swap x1/x2]  
The | market |  |   
ke | cadzu | klama | [ke'e] | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | walker | type-of-goer-to | ) | that-named | Alice.  
| is-walkingly | gone-to-by |  | that-named | Alice.  
  

The __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets cause the entire tanru to be converted by the __se__ , which would otherwise convert only __cadzu__ , leading to:
**Example 5.113. **
le | zarci | cu | se | cadzu  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | (is-a-[swap x1/x2] | walker)  
The | market |  |  | is-a-walking-surface  
klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
  

whatever that might mean. An alternative approach, since the place structure of _cadzu klama_ is that of __klama__ alone, is to convert only the latter:
**Example 5.114. **
le | zarci | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice.  
  

But the tanru in Example 5.114 may or may not have the same meaning as that in Example 5.111; in particular, because __cadzu__ is not converted, there is a suggestion that although Alice is the goer, the market is the walker. With a different sumti as x1, this seemingly odd interpretation might make considerable sense:
**Example 5.115. **
la | djan. | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice  
  

suggests that Alice is going to John, who is a moving target.
There is an alternative type of conversion, using the cmavo __jai__ of selma'o JAI optionally followed by a modal or tense construction. Grammatically, such a combination behaves exactly like conversion using SE. More details can be found in Section 9.12.

---|---|---|---  
ra |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats previous sumti)  
ru |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats long-ago sumti)  
go'i |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last bridi)  
go'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats previous bridi)  
go'u |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats long-ago bridi)  
go'e |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last-but-one bridi)  
go'o |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats future bridi)  
nei |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats current bridi)  
no'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats outer bridi)  
ra'o |  RAhO |  |  pro-cmavo update  
The term “anaphora” literally means “repetition”, but is used in linguistics to refer to pronouns whose significance is the repetition of earlier words, namely their antecedents. Lojban provides three pro-sumti anaphora, __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ ; and three corresponding pro-bridi anaphora, __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__. These cmavo reveal the same vowel pattern as the ti-series, but the “distances” referred to are not physical distances, but distances from the anaphoric cmavo to its antecedent.
The cmavo __ri__ is the simplest of these; it has the same referent as the last complete sumti appearing before the __ri__ :
**Example 7.30. **
la | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | ri | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | [repeat-last-sumti] | room.  
Alice sleeps in her room.  
---  
  

The __ri__ in Example 7.30 is equivalent to repeating the last sumti, which is _la .alis._ , so Example 7.30 is equivalent to:
**Example 7.31. **
la | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | la | .alis. | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | that-named | Alice | room.  
Alice sleeps in Alice's room.  
---  
  

Note that __ri__ does not repeat _le ri kumfa_ , because that sumti is not yet complete when __ri__ appears. This prevents __ri__ from getting entangled in paradoxes of self-reference. (There are plenty of other ways to do that!) Note also that sumti within other sumti, as in quotations, abstractions, and the like, are counted in the order of their beginnings; thus a lower level sumti like _la alis._ in Example 7.31 is considered to be more recent than a higher level sumti that contains it.
Certain sumti are ignored by __ri__ ; specifically, most of the other cmavo of KOhA, and the almost-grammatically-equivalent lerfu words of selma'o BY. It is simpler just to repeat these directly:
**Example 7.32. **
mi | prami | mi  
---|---|---  
I | love | me.  
I love myself.  
---  
  

However, the cmavo of the ti-series can be picked up by __ri__ , because you might have changed what you are pointing at, so repeating __ti__ may not be effective. Likewise, __ri__ itself (or rather its antecedent) can be repeated by a later __ri__ ; in fact, a string of __ri__ cmavo with no other intervening sumti always all repeat the same sumti:
**Example 7.33. **
la | djan. | viska | le | tricu | .i  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | sees | the | tree. |   
ri | se jadni | le |  | ri | jimca  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[repeat-last] | is-adorned-by | the | of- | [repeat-last] | branch.  
John sees the tree. It is adorned by its branches.  
---  
  

Here the second __ri__ has as antecedent the first __ri__ , which has as antecedent _le tricu_. All three refer to the same thing: a tree.
To refer to the next-to-last sumti, the third-from-last sumti, and so on, __ri__ may be subscripted (subscripts are explained in Section 19.6):
**Example 7.34. **
lo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | rixire  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [repeat-next-to-last].  
.i | la | .alis. | pilno | riximu  
---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | uses | [repeat-fifth-from-last].  
  

Here _rixire_ , or “ri-sub-2”, skips _la rik._ to reach _lo forca_. In the same way, _riximu_ , or “ri-sub-5”, skips _la .alis._ , _rixire_ , _la rik._ , and _lo forca_ to reach _lo smuci_. As can clearly be seen, this procedure is barely practicable in writing, and would break down totally in speech.
Therefore, the vaguer __ra__ and __ru__ are also provided. The cmavo __ra__ repeats a recently used sumti, and __ru__ one that was further back in the speech or text. The use of __ra__ and __ru__ forces the listener to guess at the referent, but makes life easier for the speaker. Can __ra__ refer to the last sumti, like __ri__? The answer is no if __ri__ has also been used. If __ri__ has not been used, then __ra__ might be the last sumti. Likewise, if __ra__ has been used, then any use of __ru__ would repeat a sumti earlier than the one __ra__ is repeating. A more reasonable version of Example 7.34, but one that depends more on context, is:
**Example 7.35. **
lo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | ra  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [some-previous-thing].  
.i | la | .alis. | pilno | ru  
---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | uses | [some-more-remote-thing].  
  

In Example 7.35, the use of __ra__ tells us that something other than _la rik._ is the antecedent; _lo forca_ is the nearest sumti, so it is probably the antecedent. Similarly, the antecedent of __ru__ must be something even further back in the utterance than _lo forca_ , and _lo smuci_ is the obvious candidate.
The meaning of __ri__ must be determined every time it is used. Since __ra__ and __ru__ are more vaguely defined, they may well retain the same meaning for a while, but the listener cannot count on this behavior. To make a permanent reference to something repeated by __ri__ , __ra__ , or __ru__ , use __goi__ and a ko'a-series cmavo:
**Example 7.36. **
la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | goes-to | the | store  
.i | ri | goi | ko'a | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---  
. | It-last-mentioned | also-known-as | it-1 | is-blue.  
  

allows the store to be referred to henceforth as __ko'a__ without ambiguity. Example 7.36 is equivalent to Example 7.21 and eliminates any possibility of __ko'a__ being interpreted by the listener as referring to Alice.
The cmavo __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__ follow exactly the same rules as __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ , except that they are pro-bridi, and therefore repeat bridi, not sumti – specifically, main sentence bridi. Any bridi that are embedded within other bridi, such as relative clauses or abstractions, are not counted. Like the cmavo of the broda-series, the cmavo of the go'i-series copy all sumti with them. This makes __go'i__ by itself convenient for answering a question affirmatively, or for repeating the last bridi, possibly with new sumti:
**Example 7.37. **
xu | zo | .djan. | cmene | do | .i | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True-false?] | The-word |  “John” | is-the-name-of | you? |  | [repeat last bridi].  
Is John your name? Yes.  
---  
  

**Example 7.38. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | .i | do | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store | . | You | [repeat last bridi].  
I go to the store . You, too.  
---  
  

Note that Example 7.38 means the same as Example 7.26, but without the bother of assigning an actual broda-series word to the first bridi. For long-term reference, use _go'i cei broda_ or the like, analogously to _ri goi ko'a_ in Example 7.36.
The remaining four cmavo of the go'i-series are provided for convenience or for achieving special effects. The cmavo __go'e__ means the same as _go'ixire_ : it repeats the last bridi but one. This is useful in conversation:
**Example 7.39. **
A: | mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
A: | I | [future] | go-to | the | store.  
A: I am going to the store.  
---  
B: | mi | nelci | le | si'o | mi | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
B: | I | like | the | concept-of | I | [repeat-last-bridi].  
B: I like the idea of my going.  
---  
A: | do | go'e  
---|---|---  
A: | You | [repeat-last-bridi-but-one].  
A: You'll go, too.  
---  
  

Here B's sentence repeats A's within an abstraction (explained in Chapter 11): _le si'o mi go'i_ means _le si'o mi klama le zarci_. Why must B use the word __mi__ explicitly to replace the x1 of _mi klama le zarci_ , even though it looks like __mi__ is replacing __mi__? Because B's __mi__ refers to B, whereas A's __mi__ refers to A. If B said:
**Example 7.40. **
mi nelci le si'o go'i
  

that would mean:
> I like the idea of your going to the store.
The repetition signalled by __go'i__ is not literally of words, but of concepts. Finally, A repeats her own sentence, but with the x1 changed to __do__ , meaning B. Note that in Example 7.39, the tense __ba__ (future time) is carried along by both __go'i__ and __go'e__.
Descriptions based on go'i-series cmavo can be very useful for repeating specific sumti of previous bridi:
**Example 7.41. **
le | xekri | mlatu | cu | klama | le | zarci | .i | le  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | black | cat |  | goes-to | the | store. |  | That-described-as-the-x1-place-of  
go'i | cu | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
[repeat-last-bridi] |  | walks-on | the | ice.  
The black cat goes to the store. It walks on the ice.  
---  
  

Here the __go'i__ repeats _le xekri mlatu cu klama le zarci_ , and since __le__ makes the x1 place into a description, and the x1 place of this bridi is _le xekri mlatu_ , _le go'i_ means _le xekri mlatu_.
The cmavo __go'o__ , __nei__ , and __no'a__ have been little used so far. They repeat respectively some future bridi, the current bridi, and the bridi that encloses the current bridi (__no'a__ , unlike the other members of the go'i- series, can repeat non-sentence bridi). Here are a few examples:
**Example 7.42. **
mi | nupre | le | nu | mi | go'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | promise | the | event-of | I | [repeat-future-bridi].  
.i | ba | dunda | le | djini |  | le | bersa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [Future] | give | the | money | to | the | son  
.i | ba | dunda | le | zdani |  | le | tixnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [Future] | give | the | house | to | the | daughter  
I promise to do the following: Give the money to my son. Give the house to my daughter.  
---  
  

(Note: The Lojban does not contain an equivalent of the __my__ in the colloquial English; it leaves the fact that it is the speaker's son and daughter that are referred to implicit. To make the fact explicit, use _le bersa_ /_tixnu be mi_.)
For good examples of __nei__ and __no'a__ , we need nested bridi contexts:
**Example 7.43. **
mi | se | pluka | le | nu | do | pensi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | am-pleased-by | the | event-of | (you | think-about | the | (event-of  
nei | kei | pu | le | nu | do | zukte  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[main-bridi] | ) | before | the | (event-of | your | acting).  
I am pleased that you thought about whether I would be pleased (about ...) before you acted.  
---  
  

**Example 7.44. **
mi | ba | klama | ca | le | nu | do | no'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | go | [present] | the | event-of | you | [repeats outer bridi]  
I will go when you do.  
---  
  

Finally, __ra'o__ is a cmavo that can be appended to any go'i-series cmavo, or indeed any cmavo of selma'o GOhA, to signal that pro-sumti or pro-bridi cmavo in the antecedent are to be repeated literally and reinterpreted in their new context. Normally, any pro-sumti used within the antecedent of the pro-bridi keep their meanings intact. In the presence of __ra'o__ , however, their meanings must be reinterpreted with reference to the new environment. If someone says to you:
**Example 7.45. **
mi ba lumci le mi karce  
---  
I will wash my car.  
---  
  

you might reply either:
**Example 7.46. **
mi go'i  
---  
I will wash your car.  
---  
  

or:
**Example 7.47. **
mi go'i ra'o  
---  
I will wash my car.  
---  
  

The __ra'o__ forces the second __mi__ from the original bridi to mean the new speaker rather than the former speaker. This means that _go'e ra'o_ would be an acceptable alternative to _do go'e_ in B's statement in Example 7.39.
The anaphoric pro-sumti of this section can be used in quotations, but never refer to any of the supporting text outside the quotation, since speakers presumably do not know that they may be quoted by someone else.
However, a _ri-_ series or _go'a-_ series reference within a quotation can refer to something mentioned in an earlier quotation if the two quotations are closely related in time and context. This allows a quotation to be broken up by narrative material without interfering with the pro-sumti within it. Here's an example:
**Example 7.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | lu | mi | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | says | [quote] | I | go-to | the | store | [unquote].  
.i | la | .alis. | cusku | lu | mi | go'i | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | says | [quote] | I | [repeat] | [unquote].  
John says, “I am going to the store.” Alice says, “Me too.”  
---  
  

Of course, there is no problem with narrative material referring to something within a quotation: people who quote, unlike people who are quoted, are aware of what they are doing.

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  
I'm worn out by your continuous talking.  
---  
  

**Example 13.27. **
.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  
I'm putting you to bed.  
---  
  

**Example 13.28. **
.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.  
---  
  

**Example 13.29. **
.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  
I hope I feel better tomorrow!  
---  
  

**Example 13.30. **
.au | mi | sipna  
---|---|---  
[desire] | I | sleep.  
I want to sleep.  
---  
  

**Example 13.31. **
.a'ucu'i | do | pante  
---|---|---  
[no-interest] | you | complain.  
I have no interest in your complaints.  
---  
  

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.

---|---|---|---|---|---

---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  
---
