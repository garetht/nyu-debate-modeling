## 2.16. Indicators
Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. “Aha!”, “Oh no!”, “Ouch!”, “Aahh!”, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.
Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left. For example:
**Example 2.79. **
.ie |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Agreement! |  I |  - |  go.  
Yep! I'll go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.80. **
.ei |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Obligation! |  I |  - |  go.  
I should go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.81. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  le melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go |  to-the beautiful-thing  
.ui |  [ku]  
---|---  
and I am happy because it is the beautiful thing I'm going to |  -  
  

Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison, the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means “and”.
**Example 2.82. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  You |  - |  stay.  
  

**Example 2.83. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ji'a |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  In addition, |  you |  - |  stay. |  added weight  
  

**Example 2.84. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ku'i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  However, |  you |  - |  stay. |  contrast  
  

Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”. Evidentials show the speaker's relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include __za'a__ (I directly observe the relationship), __pe'i__ (I believe that the relationship holds), __ru'a__ (I postulate the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.
**Example 2.85. **
pe'i |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I opine! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.  
  

**Example 2.86. **
za'a |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I directly observe! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.

## 2.11. Examples of brivla
The simplest form of selbri is an individual word. A word which may by itself express a selbri relation is called a __brivla__. The three types of brivla are gismu (root words), lujvo (compounds), and fu'ivla (borrowings from other languages). All have identical grammatical uses. So far, most of our selbri have been gismu or tanru built from gismu.
gismu:
**Example 2.46. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  ti |  zo'e |  zo'e |  ta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go-er |  - |  goes |  destination |  origin |  route |  means.  
I go here (to this) using that means (from somewhere via some route).  
---  
  

lujvo:
**Example 2.47. **
ta |  [cu] |  blari'o  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  is-blue-green.  
  

fu'ivla:
**Example 2.48. **
ti |  [cu] |  djarspageti  
---|---|---  
This |  - |  is-spaghetti.  
  

Some cmavo may also serve as selbri, acting as variables that stand for another selbri. The most commonly used of these is __go'i__ , which represents the main bridi of the previous Lojban sentence, with any new sumti or other sentence features being expressed replacing the previously expressed ones. Thus, in this context:
**Example 2.49. **
ta |  [cu] |  go'i  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  too/same-as-last selbri.  
That (is spaghetti), too.  
---

## 11.5. Amount abstractions
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
ni |  NU |  amount abstraction  
---|---|---  
Amount abstractions are far more limited than event or property abstractions. They really make sense only if the selbri of the abstracted bridi is subject to measurement of some sort. Thus we can speak of:
**Example 11.34. **
le | ni | le | pixra | cu | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | amount-of | (the | picture |  | being-blue | )  
the amount of blueness in the picture  
---  
  

because “blueness” could be measured with a colorimeter or a similar device. However,
**Example 11.35. **
le | ni | la | djein. | cu | mamta | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | amount-of | (that-named | Jane |  | being-a-mother | )  
the amount of Jane's mother-ness (?)  
---  
the amount of mother-ness in Jane (?)  
  

makes very little sense in either Lojban or English. We simply do not have any sort of measurement scale for being a mother.
Semantically, a sumti with _le ni_ is a number; however, it cannot be treated grammatically as a quantifier in Lojban unless prefixed by the mathematical cmavo __mo'e__ :
**Example 11.36. **
li | pa | vu'u | mo'e | le | ni |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 1 | minus | the-operand | the | amount-of | (  
le | pixra | cu | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | picture |  | being-blue | )  
1 - B, where `B` = blueness of the picture  
---  
  

Mathematical Lojban is beyond the scope of this chapter, and is explained more fully in Chapter 18.
There are contexts where either property or amount abstractions make sense, and in such constructions, amount abstractions can make use of __ce'u__ just like property abstractors. Thus,
**Example 11.37. **
le | pixra | cu | cenba | le | ka | ce'u | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | picture |  | varies | in-the | property-of | (X | is blue | ).  
The picture varies in being blue.  
---  
The picture varies in blueness.  
  

is not the same as
**Example 11.38. **
le | pixra | cu | cenba | le | ni | ce'u | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | picture |  | varies | in-the | amount-of | (X | is blue | ).  
The picture varies in how blue it is.  
---  
The picture varies in blueness.  
  

Example 11.37 conveys that the blueness comes and goes, whereas Example 11.38 conveys that its quantity changes over time.
Whenever we talk of measurement of an amount, there is some sort of scale, and so the place structure of __ni__ abstraction selbri is:
> _ _ni_ _ x1 is the amount of (the bridi) on scale x2
Note: the best way to express the x2 places of abstract sumti is to use something like _le ni ... kei be_. See Example 11.62 for the use of this construction.

## 11.4. Property abstractions
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ka |  NU |  property abstractor  
---|---|---  
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
The things described by _le nu_ descriptions (or, to put it another way, the things of which __nu__ selbri may correctly be predicated) are only moderately “abstract”. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is “the property of being blue”, or “the property of being a go-er”? They are what logicians call “intensions”. If John has a heart, then “the property of having a heart” is an abstract object which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,
**Example 11.21. **
la | djan. | cu | se risna | zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-as-heart | something-unspecified.  
John has a heart.  
---  
  

has the same truth conditions as
**Example 11.22. **
la | djan. | cu | ckaji  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-the-property  
le | ka | se risna | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | having-as-heart | something.  
John has the property of having a heart.  
---  
  

(The English word “have” frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban properties: things are said to “have” properties, but this is not the same sense of “have” as in “I have money”, which is possession.)
Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:
**Example 11.23. **
do | cnino | mi | le | ka | xunre | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-new | to-me | in-the-quality-of-the | property-of | being-red.  
You are new to me in redness.  
---  
  

(The English suffix “-ness” often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix “-ity”.)
We can also move the property description to the x1 place of Example 11.23, producing:
**Example 11.24. **
le | ka | do | xunre | [kei] | cu | cnino | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | property-of | your | being-red |  |  | is-new | to me.  
Your redness is new to me.  
---  
  

It would be suitable to use Example 11.23 and Example 11.24 to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.
There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:
**Example 11.25. **
ka | mi | prami | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | me | loving | something-unspecified  
  

is quite different from
**Example 11.26. **
ka | [zo'e] | prami | mi | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | something-unspecified | loving | me  
  

In particular, sentences like Example 11.27 and Example 11.28 are quite different in meaning:
**Example 11.27. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami  
---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X)  
I love John more than I love George.  
---  
  

**Example 11.28. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka |  | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property of | (X | loves | me).  
John loves me more than George loves me.  
---  
  

The “X” used in the glosses of Example 11.27 through Example 11.28 as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in Section 11.2. Instead, the cmavo __ce'u__ of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)
Therefore, an explicit equivalent of Example 11.27, with no ellipsis, is:
**Example 11.29. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami | ce'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X).  
  

and of Example 11.28 is:
**Example 11.30. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | ce'u | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (X | loves | me).  
  

This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:
**Example 11.31. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of |  | giving | the | horse  
  

into
**Example 11.32. **
le | ka | ce'u | dunda | le | xirma |  | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | someone-unspecified | )  
the property of being a giver of the horse  
---  
  

which is the most natural interpretation of Example 11.31, versus
**Example 11.33. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma |  | ce'u | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (someone-unspecified | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | X | )  
the property of being one to whom the horse is given  
---  
  

which is also a possible interpretation.
It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction. Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri __bridi__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _bridi_ _ x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction) among arguments (sequence/set) x3
The place structure of __ka__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> _ _ka_ _ x1 is a property of (the bridi)

## 7.11. Abstraction focus pro-sumti: _ce'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __ce'u__ is used within abstraction bridi, particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo __ka__. Abstractions, including the uses of __ce'u__ , are discussed in full in Chapter 11.
In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using __ce'u__. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly between:
**Example 7.71. **
le | ka | ce'u | gleki  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | being-happy)  
the property of being happy  
---  
happiness  
  

and
**Example 7.72. **
le | ka | gleki | ce'u  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (being-happy-about | X)  
the property of being that which someone is happy about

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 16.11. Using _naku_ outside a prenex
Let us consider the English sentence
**Example 16.79. **
Some children do not go to school.
  

We cannot express this directly with __na__ ; the apparently obvious translation
**Example 16.80. **
su'oda | poi | verba  
---|---|---  
At-least-one-X | which-are | child(ren)  
na | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
[false] | go-to | at-least-one-Y | which-are | school(s).  
  

when converted to the external negation form produces:
**Example 16.81. **
naku | zo'u | su'oda | poi | verba | cu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-false | that | some-which | are | children |   
klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---  
go-to | some-which | are | schools.  
All children don't go to some school (not just some children).  
---  
  

Lojban provides a negation form which more closely emulates natural language negation. This involves putting _naku_ before the selbri, instead of a __na__. _naku_ is clearly a contradictory negation, given its parallel with prenex bridi negation. Using _naku_ , Example 16.79 can be expressed as:
**Example 16.82. **
su'oda | poi | verba | naku | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | which-are | children | don't | go-to | some | which-are | schools.  
Some children don't go to a school.  
---  
  

Although it is not technically a sumti, _naku_ can be used in most of the places where a sumti may appear. We'll see what this means in a moment.
When you use _naku_ within a bridi, you are explicitly creating a negation boundary. As explained in Section 16.9, when a prenex negation boundary expressed by _naku_ moves past a quantifier, the quantifier has to be inverted. The same is true for _naku_ in the bridi proper. We can move _naku_ to any place in the sentence where a sumti can go, inverting any quantifiers that the negation boundary crosses. Thus, the following are equivalent to Example 16.82 (no good English translations exist):
**Example 16.83. **
su'oda | poi | verba | cu | klama | rode | poi | ckule | naku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For some children, for every school, they don't go to it.  
---  
  

**Example 16.84. **
su'oda | poi | verba | cu | klama | naku | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some children don't go to (some) school(s).  
---  
  

**Example 16.85. **
naku | roda | poi | verba | cu | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is false that all children go to some school(s).  
---  
  

In Example 16.83, we moved the negation boundary rightward across the quantifier of __de__ , forcing us to invert it. In Example 16.85 we moved the negation boundary across the quantifier of __da__ , forcing us to invert it instead. Example 16.84 merely switched the selbri and the negation boundary, with no effect on the quantifiers.
The same rules apply if you rearrange the sentence so that the quantifier crosses an otherwise fixed negation. You can't just convert the selbri of Example 16.82 and rearrange the sumti to produce
**Example 16.86. **
su'ode | poi | ckule | ku'o | naku | se | klama | roda | poi | verba  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some schools aren't gone-to-by every child.  
---  
  

or rather, Example 16.86 means something completely different from Example 16.82. Conversion with __se__ under _naku_ negation is not symmetric; not all sumti are treated identically, and some sumti are not invariant under conversion. Thus, internal negation with _naku_ is considered an advanced technique, used to achieve stylistic compatibility with natural languages.
It isn't always easy to see which quantifiers have to be inverted in a sentence. Example 16.82 is identical in meaning to:
**Example 16.87. **
su'o | verba | naku | klama | su'o | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | children | don't | go-to | some | school.  
  

but in Example 16.87, the bound variables __da__ and __de__ have been hidden.
It is trivial to export an internal bridi negation expressed with __na__ to the prenex, as we saw in Section 16.9; you just move it to the left end of the prenex. In comparison, it is non-trivial to export a _naku_ to the prenex because of the quantifiers. The rules for exporting _naku_ require that you export all of the quantified variables (implicit or explicit) along with _naku_ , and you must export them from left to right, in the same order that they appear in the sentence. Thus Example 16.82 goes into prenex form as:
**Example 16.88. **
su'oda | poi | verba | ku'o | naku  
---|---|---|---|---  
For-some-X | which | is-a-child, |  | it-is-not-the-case-that  
su'ode | poi | ckule | zo'u | da | klama | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-is-a-Y | which | is-a-school | such-that: | X | goes | to | Y.  
  

We can now move the _naku_ to the left end of the prenex, getting a contradictory negation that can be expressed with __na__ :
**Example 16.89. **
naku | roda | poi | verba  
---|---|---|---  
It-is-not-the-case-that | for-all-X's | which-are | children,  
su'ode | poi | ckule | zo'u | da | klama | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-is-a-Y | which-is | a-school | such-that: | X | goes-to | Y.  
  

from which we can restore the quantified variables to the sentence, giving:
**Example 16.90. **
naku | zo'u | roda | poi | verba | cu | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is not the case that all children go to some school.  
---  
  

or more briefly
**Example 16.91. **
ro | verba | cu | na | klama | su'o | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | children |  | [false] | go-to | some | school(s).  
  

As noted in Section 16.5, a sentence with two different quantified variables, such as Example 16.91, cannot always be converted with __se__ without first exporting the quantified variables. When the variables have been exported, the sentence proper can be converted, but the quantifier order in the prenex must remain unchanged:
**Example 16.92. **
roda | poi | verba | su'ode  
---|---|---|---  
for-all-X's | which-are | children, | there-is-a-Y  
poi | ckule | zo'u | de | na | se | klama | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
which | is-a-school | such-that: | Y |  |  | is-gone-to-by | X.  
  

While you can't freely convert with __se__ when you have two quantified variables in a sentence, you can still freely move sumti to either side of the selbri, as long as the order isn't changed. If you use __na__ negation in such a sentence, nothing special need be done. If you use _naku_ negation, then quantified variables that cross the negation boundary must be inverted.
Clearly, if all of Lojban negation was built on _naku_ negation instead of __na__ negation, logical manipulation in Lojban would be as difficult as in natural languages. In Section 16.12, for example, we'll discuss DeMorgan's Law, which must be used whenever a sumti with a logical connection is moved across a negation boundary.
Since _naku_ has the grammar of a sumti, it can be placed almost anywhere a sumti can go, including __be__ and __bei__ clauses; it isn't clear what these mean, and we recommend avoiding such constructs.
You can put multiple _naku_ compounds in a sentence, each forming a separate negation boundary. Two adjacent _naku_ compounds in a bridi are a double negative and cancel out:
**Example 16.93. **
mi naku naku le zarci cu klama
  

Other expressions using two _naku_ compounds may or may not cancel out. If there is no quantified variable between them, then the _naku_ compounds cancel.
Negation with internal _naku_ is clumsy and non-intuitive for logical manipulations, but then, so are the natural language features it is emulating.

## 8.10. Relative clauses within relative clauses
For the most part, these are straightforward and uncomplicated: a sumti that is part of a relative clause bridi may itself be modified by a relative clause:
**Example 8.81. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | blanu | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | is-blue |  | is-slow.  
  

However, an ambiguity can exist if __ke'a__ is used in a relative clause within a relative clause: does it refer to the outermost sumti, or to the sumti within the outer relative clause to which the inner relative clause is attached? The latter. To refer to the former, use a subscript on __ke'a__ :
**Example 8.82. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'axire | zbasu | ke'a | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | IT-sub-2 | built | IT |  | is-slow.  
The person who is in the room which he built is slow.  
---  
  

Here, the meaning of “IT-sub-2” is that sumti attached to the second relative clause, counting from the innermost, is used. Therefore, _ke'axipa_ (IT-sub-1) means the same as plain __ke'a__.
Alternatively, you can use a prenex (explained in full in Chapter 16), which is syntactically a series of sumti followed by the special cmavo __zo'u__ , prefixed to the relative clause bridi:
**Example 8.83. **
le | prenu | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'a | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | who | (IT | = | it1 | :  
ko'a | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'e | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | is-in | the | room | which | (IT | = | it2 | :  
ko'a | zbasu | ko'e | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | built | it2) |  | is-slow.  
  

Example 8.83 is more verbose than Example 8.82, but may be clearer, since it explicitly spells out the two __ke'a__ cmavo, each on its own level, and assigns them to the assignable cmavo __ko'a__ and __ko'e__ (explained in Section 7.5).
