## 2.16. Indicators
Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. “Aha!”, “Oh no!”, “Ouch!”, “Aahh!”, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.
Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left. For example:
**Example 2.79. **
.ie |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Agreement! |  I |  - |  go.  
Yep! I'll go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.80. **
.ei |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Obligation! |  I |  - |  go.  
I should go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.81. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  le melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go |  to-the beautiful-thing  
.ui |  [ku]  
---|---  
and I am happy because it is the beautiful thing I'm going to |  -  
  

Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison, the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means “and”.
**Example 2.82. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  You |  - |  stay.  
  

**Example 2.83. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ji'a |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  In addition, |  you |  - |  stay. |  added weight  
  

**Example 2.84. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ku'i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  However, |  you |  - |  stay. |  contrast  
  

Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”. Evidentials show the speaker's relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include __za'a__ (I directly observe the relationship), __pe'i__ (I believe that the relationship holds), __ru'a__ (I postulate the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.
**Example 2.85. **
pe'i |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I opine! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.  
  

**Example 2.86. **
za'a |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I directly observe! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.

## 13.12. Discursives
The term “discursive” is used for those members of selma'o UI that provide structure to the discourse, and which show how a given word or utterance relates to the whole discourse. To express these concepts in regular bridi would involve extra layers of nesting: rather than asserting that “I also came”, we would have to say “I came; furthermore, the event of my coming is an additional instance of the relationship expressed by the previous sentence”, which is intolerably clumsy. Typical English equivalents of discursives are words or phrases like “however”, “summarizing”, “in conclusion”, and “for example”.
Discursives are not attitudinals: they express no particular emotion. Rather, they are abbreviations for metalinguistic claims that reference the sentence or text they are found in.
Discursives are most often used at the beginning of sentences, often attached to the __i__ that separates sentences in running discourse, but can (like all other indicators) be attached to single words when it seems necessary or useful.
The discursives discussed in this section are given in groups, roughly organized by function. First, the “consecutive discourse” group:
ku'i |  [karbi] |  however/but/in contrast  
---|---|---  
ji'a |  [jmina] |  additionally  
si'a |  [simsa] |  similarly  
mi'u |  [mintu] |  ditto  
po'o |  |  the only relevant case  
These five discursives are mutually exclusive, and therefore they are not usually considered as scales. The first four are used in consecutive discourse. The first, __ku'i__ , makes an exception to the previous argument. The second, __ji'a__ , adds weight to the previous argument. The third, __si'a__ , adds quantity to the previous argument, enumerating an additional example. The fourth, __mi'u__ , adds a parallel case to the previous argument, and can also be used in tables or the like to show that something is being repeated from the previous column. It is distinct from __go'i__ (of selma'o GOhA, discussed in Section 7.6), which is a non-discursive version of “ditto” that explicitly repeats the claim of the previous bridi.
Lastly, __po'o__ is used when there is no other comparable case, and thus corresponds to some of the uses of “only”, a word difficult to express in pure bridi form:
**Example 13.83. **
mi | po'o | darxi | le | mi | tamne | fo | le | nazbi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [only] | hit | the | of-me | cousin | at-locus | the | nose.  
Only I (nobody else) hit my cousin on his nose.  
---  
  

**Example 13.84. **
mi | darxi | po'o | le | mi | tamne | fo | le | nazbi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | hit | [only] | the | of-me | cousin | at-locus | the | nose.  
I only hit my cousin on his nose (I did nothing else to him).  
---  
  

**Example 13.85. **
mi | darxi | le | mi | tamne | po'o | fo | le | nazbi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | hit | the | of-me | cousin | [only] | at-locus | the | nose.  
I hit only my cousin on his nose (no one else).  
---  
  

**Example 13.86. **
mi | darxi | le | mi | tamne | fo | le | nazbi | po'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | hit | the | of-me | cousin | at-locus | the | nose | [only].  
I hit my cousin only on his nose (nowhere else).  
---  
  

Note that “only” can go before or after what it modifies in English, but __po'o__ , as an indicator, always comes afterward.
Next, the “commentary on words” group:
va'i |  [valsi] |  in other words |  in the same words  
---|---|---|---  
ta'u |  [tanru] |  expanding a tanru |  making a tanru  
The discursives __va'i__ and __ta'u__ operate at the level of words, rather than discourse proper, or if you like, they deal with how things are said. An alternative English expression for __va'i__ is “rephrasing”; for __va'inai__ , “repeating”. Also compare __va'i__ with __ke'u__ , discussed below.
The cmavo __ta'u__ is a discursive unique to Lojban; it expresses the particularly Lojbanic device of tanru. Since tanru are semantically ambiguous, they are subject to misunderstanding. This ambiguity can be removed by expanding the tanru into some semantically unambiguous structure, often involving relative clauses or the introduction of additional brivla. The discursive __ta'u__ marks the transition from the use of a brief but possibly confusing tanru to its fuller, clearer expansion; the discursive __ta'unai__ marks a transition in the reverse direction.
Next, the “commentary on discourse” group:
li'a |  [klina] |  clearly; obviously |  |  obscurely  
---|---|---|---|---  
ba'u |  [banli] |  exaggeration |  accuracy |  understatement  
zo'o |  |  humorously |  dully |  seriously  
sa'e |  [satci] |  precisely speaking |  |  loosely speaking  
to'u |  [tordu] |  in brief |  |  in detail  
do'a |  [dunda] |  generously |  |  parsimoniously  
sa'u |  [sampu] |  simply |  |  elaborating  
pa'e |  [pajni] |  justice |  |  prejudice  
je'u |  [jetnu] |  truly |  |  falsely  
This group is used by the speaker to characterize the nature of the discourse, so as to prevent misunderstanding. It is well-known that listeners often fail to recognize a humorous statement and take it seriously, or miss an exaggeration, or try to read more into a statement than the speaker intends to put there. In speech, the tone of voice often provides the necessary cue, but the reader of ironic or understated or imprecise discourse is often simply clueless. As with the attitudinals, the use of these cmavo may seem fussy to new Lojbanists, but it is important to remember that __zo'o__ , for example, is the equivalent of smiling while you speak, not the equivalent of a flat declaration like “What I'm about to say is supposed to be funny.”
A few additional English equivalents: for __sa'enai__ , “roughly speaking” or “approximately speaking”; for __sa'unai__ , “furthermore”; for __to'u__ , “in short” or “skipping details”; for __do'a__ , “broadly construed”; for __do'anai__ (as you might expect), “narrowly construed”.
The cmavo __pa'e__ is used to claim (truly or falsely) that one is being fair or just to all parties mentioned, whereas __pa'enai__ admits (or proclaims) a bias in favor of one party.
The scale of __je'u__ and __je'unai__ is a little different from the others in the group. By default, we assume that people speak the truth – or at least, that if they are lying, they will do their best to conceal it from us. So under what circumstances would __je'unai__ be used, or __je'u__ be useful? For one thing, __je'u__ can be used to mark a tautology: a sentence that is a truth of logic, like “All cats are cats.” Its counterpart __je'unai__ then serves to mark a logical contradiction. In addition, __je'unai__ can be used to express one kind of sarcasm or irony, where the speaker pretends to believe what he/she says, but actually wishes the listener to infer a contrary opinion. Other forms of irony can be marked with __zo'o__ (humor) or __.ianai__ (disbelief).
When used as a discursive, __su'a__ (see Section 13.11) belongs to this group.
Next, the “knowledge” group:
ju'o |  [djuno] |  certainly |  uncertain |  certainly not  
---|---|---|---|---  
la'a |  [lakne] |  probably |  |  improbably  
These two discursives describe the speaker's state of knowledge about the claim of the associated bridi. They are similar to the propositional attitudes of Section 13.3, as they create a hypothetical world. We may be quite certain that something is true, and label our bridi with __ju'o__ ; but it may be false all the same.
Next, the “discourse management” group:
ta'o |  [tanjo] |  by the way |  |  returning to point  
---|---|---|---|---  
ra'u |  [ralju] |  chiefly |  equally |  incidentally  
mu'a |  [mupli] |  for example |  omitting examples |  end examples  
zu'u |  |  on the one hand |  |  on the other hand  
ke'u |  [krefu] |  repeating |  |  continuing  
da'i |  |  supposing |  |  in fact  
This final group is used to perform what may be called “managing the discourse”: providing reference points to help the listener understand the flow from one sentence to the next.
Other English equivalents of __ta'onai__ are “anyway”, “anyhow”, “in any case”, “in any event”, “as I was saying”, and “continuing”.
The scale of __ra'u__ has to do with the importance of the point being, or about to be, expressed: __ra'u__ is the most important point, __ra'ucu'i__ is a point of equal importance, and __ra'unai__ is a lesser point. Other English equivalents of __ra'u__ are “above all” and “primarily”.
The cmavo __ke'u__ is very similar to __va'i__ , although __ke'unai__ and __va'inai__ are quite different. Both __ke'u__ and __va'i__ indicate that the same idea is going to be expressed using different words, but the two cmavo differ in emphasis. Using __ke'u__ emphasizes that the content is the same; using __va'i__ emphasizes that the words are different. Therefore, __ke'unai__ shows that the content is new (and therefore the words are also); __va'inai__ shows that the words are the same (and therefore so is the content). One English equivalent of __ke'unai__ is “furthermore”.
The discursive __da'i__ marks the discourse as possibly taking a non-real-world viewpoint (“Supposing that”, “By hypothesis”), whereas __da'inai__ insists on the real-world point of view (“In fact”, “In truth”, “According to the facts”). A common use of __da'i__ is to distinguish between:
**Example 13.87. **
ganai | da'i | do | viska | le | mi | citno | mensi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
If | [hypothetical] | you | see | the | of-me | young | sister,  
gi | ju'o | do | djuno | le | du'u | ri | pazvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [certain] | you | know | the | predication-of | she | is-pregnant.  
If you were to see my younger sister, you would certainly know she is pregnant.  
---  
  

and:
**Example 13.88. **
ganai | da'inai | do | viska | le | mi | citno | mensi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
If | [factual] | you | see | the | of-me | young | sister,  
gi | ju'o | do | djuno | le | du'u | ri | pazvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [certainty] | you | know | the | predication-of | she | is-pregnant.  
If you saw my younger sister, you would certainly know she is pregnant.  
---  
  

It is also perfectly correct to omit the discursive altogether, and leave the context to indicate which significance is meant. (Chinese always leaves this distinction to the context: the Chinese sentence
**Example 13.89. **
  * _ru 2guo3 ni3 kan4dao4 wo3 mei4mei, ni3 yi2ding4 zhi1dao4 ta1 huai2yun4 le_
  * if you see-arrive my younger-sister, you certainly know she pregnant


  

is the equivalent of either Example 13.87 or Example 13.88.)

## 10.15. Tenses in subordinate bridi
English has a set of rules, formally known as “sequence of tense rules”, for determining what tense should be used in a subordinate clause, depending on the tense used in the main sentence. Here are some examples:
**Example 10.100. **
John says that George is going to the market.
  

**Example 10.101. **
John says that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.102. **
John said that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.103. **
John said that George had gone to the market.
  

In Example 10.100 and Example 10.101, the tense of the main sentence is the present: “says”. If George goes when John speaks, we get the present tense “is going” (“goes” would be unidiomatic); if George goes before John speaks, we get the past tense “went”. But if the tense of the main sentence is the past, with “said”, then the tense required in the subordinate clause is different. If George goes when John speaks, we get the past tense “went”; if George goes before John speaks, we get the past-perfect tense “had gone”.
The rule of English, therefore, is that both the tense of the main sentence and the tense of the subordinate clause are understood relative to the speaker of the main sentence (not John, but the person who speaks Example 10.100 through Example 10.103).
Lojban, like Russian and Esperanto, uses a different convention. A tense in a subordinate bridi is understood to be relative to the tense already set in the main bridi. Thus Example 10.100 through Example 10.103 can be expressed in Lojban respectively thus:
**Example 10.104. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.105. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.106. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.107. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

Probably the most counterintuitive of the Lojban examples is Example 10.106. The __ca__ looks quite odd, as if George were going to the market right now, rather than back when John spoke. But this __ca__ is really a __ca__ with respect to a reference point specified by the outer __pu__. This behavior is the same as the additive behavior of multiple tenses in the same bridi, as explained in Section 10.13.
There is a special cmavo __nau__ (of selma'o CUhE) which can be used to override these rules and get to the speaker's current reference point. (Yes, it sounds like English “now”.) It is not grammatical to combine __nau__ with any other cmavo in a tense, except by way of a logical or non-logical connection (see Section 10.20). Here is a convoluted sentence with several nested bridi which uses __nau__ at the lowest level:
**Example 10.108. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | .alis | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | maris. | nau | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Mary | [now] | goes-to | the | market.  
John said that Alice had said that George had earlier said that Mary is now going to the market.  
---  
  

The use of __nau__ does not affect sticky tenses.

## 11.7. Predication/sentence abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
du'u |  NU |  predication abstraction  
---|---|---  
There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:
**Example 11.42. **
I know that Frank is a fool.
  

How's that in Lojban? Let us try:
**Example 11.43. **
mi | djuno | le | nu | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the event of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can't be contained inside one's mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; Example 11.43 comes close to claiming that Frank's being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, Example 11.43 is an instance of improperly marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in Section 11.10).
Try again:
**Example 11.44. **
mi | djuno | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.

Closer. Example 11.44 says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn't say that he is one, as Example 11.42 does. To catch that nuance, we must say:
**Example 11.45. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the predication that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a fool” is not a property of _le du'u_ abstraction, but of __djuno__ ; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, __djuno__ like __jei__ has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) Example 11.46 has no such implied assertion:
**Example 11.46. **
mi | kucli | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

and here __du'u__ could probably be replaced by __jei__ without much change in meaning:
**Example 11.47. **
mi | kucli | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about how true it is that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, __du'u__ has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:
> _ _du'u_ _ x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2
and _le se du'u ..._ is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:
**Example 11.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | le | se du'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses | the | (sentence-expressing-that  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes-to | the | store | )  
John says that George goes to the store.  
---  
  

Example 11.48 differs from
**Example 11.49. **
la | djan | cusku | lu  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses, | quote,  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes | to-the | store, | unquote.  
John says “George goes to the store”.  
---  
  

because Example 11.49 claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas Example 11.48 claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.
_le se du'u_ is much the same as _lu'e le du'u_ , a symbol for the predication, but _se du'u_ can be used as a selbri, whereas __lu'e__ is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See Section 6.10 for a discussion of __lu'e__.)

## 11.8. Indirect questions
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
kau |  UI |  indirect question marker  
---|---|---  
There is an alternative type of sentence involving __du'u__ and a selbri expressing a propositional attitude. In addition to sentences like
**Example 11.50. **
I know that John went to the store.
  

we can also say things like
**Example 11.51. **
I know who went to the store.
  

This form is called an “indirect question” in English because the embedded English sentence is a question: “Who went to the store?” A person who says Example 11.51 is claiming to know the answer to this question. Indirect questions can occur with many other English verbs as well: I can wonder, or doubt, or see, or hear, as well as know who went to the store.
To express indirect questions in Lojban, we use a _le du'u_ abstraction, but rather than using a question word like “who” (__ma__ in Lojban), we use any word that will fit grammatically and mark it with the suffix particle __kau__. This cmavo belongs to selma'o UI, so grammatically it can appear anywhere. The simplest Lojban translation of Example 11.51 is therefore:
**Example 11.52. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u  
---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of  
ma | kau | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
X | [indirect-question] | [past] | going-to | the | store.  
  

In Example 11.52, we have chosen to use __ma__ as the word marked by __kau__. In fact, any other sumti would have done as well: __zo'e__ or __da__ or even _la djan._. Using _la djan._ would suggest that it was John who I knew had gone to the store, however:
**Example 11.53. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u  
---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of/fact-that  
la | djan. | kau | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | John | [indirect-question] | [past] | going-to | the | store.  
I know who went to the store, namely John.  
---  
I know that it was John who went to the store.  
  

Using one of the indefinite pro-sumti such as __ma__ , __zo'e__ , or __da__ does not suggest any particular value.
Why does Lojban require the __kau__ marker, rather than using __ma__ as English and Chinese and many other languages do? Because __ma__ always signals a direct question, and so
**Example 11.54. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | ma | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of | [what sumti?] | [past] | goes-to | the | store  
  

means
**Example 11.55. **
Who is it that I know goes to the store?
  

It is actually not necessary to use _le du'u_ and __kau__ at all if the indirect question involves a sumti; there is generally a paraphrase of the type:
**Example 11.56. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | pu | klama | be | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the | [past] | goer | to | the | store.  
I know something about the one who went to the store (namely, his identity).  
---  
  

because the x3 place of __djuno__ is the subject of knowledge, as opposed to the fact that is known. But when the questioned point is not a sumti, but (say) a logical connection, then there is no good alternative to __kau__ :
**Example 11.57. **
mi | ba | zgana | le | du'u | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | observe | the | predication-of/fact-that | that-named | John  
jikau | la | djordj. | cu | zvati | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[connective-indirect-question] | that-named | George |  | is-at | the | park.  
I will see whether John or George (or both) is at the park.  
---  
  

In addition, Example 11.56 is only a loose paraphrase of Example 11.52, because it is left to the listener's insight to realize that what is known about the goer-to-the-store is his identity rather than some other of his attributes.

## 11.7. Predication/sentence abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
du'u |  NU |  predication abstraction  
---|---|---  
There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:
**Example 11.42. **
I know that Frank is a fool.
  

How's that in Lojban? Let us try:
**Example 11.43. **
mi | djuno | le | nu | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the event of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can't be contained inside one's mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; Example 11.43 comes close to claiming that Frank's being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, Example 11.43 is an instance of improperly marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in Section 11.10).
Try again:
**Example 11.44. **
mi | djuno | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Closer. Example 11.44 says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn't say that he is one, as Example 11.42 does. To catch that nuance, we must say:
**Example 11.45. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the predication that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a fool” is not a property of _le du'u_ abstraction, but of __djuno__ ; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, __djuno__ like __jei__ has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) Example 11.46 has no such implied assertion:
**Example 11.46. **
mi | kucli | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

and here __du'u__ could probably be replaced by __jei__ without much change in meaning:
**Example 11.47. **
mi | kucli | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about how true it is that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, __du'u__ has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:
> _ _du'u_ _ x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2
and _le se du'u ..._ is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:
**Example 11.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | le | se du'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses | the | (sentence-expressing-that  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes-to | the | store | )  
John says that George goes to the store.  
---  
  

Example 11.48 differs from
**Example 11.49. **
la | djan | cusku | lu  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses, | quote,  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes | to-the | store, | unquote.  
John says “George goes to the store”.  
---  
  

because Example 11.49 claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas Example 11.48 claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.
_le se du'u_ is much the same as _lu'e le du'u_ , a symbol for the predication, but _se du'u_ can be used as a selbri, whereas __lu'e__ is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See Section 6.10 for a discussion of __lu'e__.)

---

Using one of the indefinite pro-sumti such as __ma__ , __zo'e__ , or __da__ does not suggest any particular value.
Why does Lojban require the __kau__ marker, rather than using __ma__ as English and Chinese and many other languages do? Because __ma__ always signals a direct question, and so

## 13.13. Miscellaneous indicators
Some indicators do not fall neatly into the categories of attitudinal, evidential, or discursive. This section discusses the following miscellaneous indicators:
ki'a |  metalinguistic confusion  
---|---  
na'i |  metalinguistic negator  
jo'a |  metalinguistic affirmer  
li'o |  omitted text (quoted material)  
sa'a |  material inserted by editor/narrator  
xu |  true-false question  
pau |  question premarker |  |  rhetorical question  
pe'a |  figurative language |  |  literal language  
bi'u |  new information |  |  old information  
ge'e |  non-specific indicator  
The cmavo __ki'a__ is one of the most common of the miscellaneous indicators. It expresses metalinguistic confusion; i.e. confusion about what has been said, as opposed to confusion not tied to the discourse (which is __.uanai__). The confusion may be about the meaning of a word or of a grammatical construct, or about the referent of a sumti. One of the uses of English “which” corresponds to __ki'a__ :
**Example 13.90. **
mi | nelci | le | ctuca  
---|---|---|---  
I | like | the | teacher.  
.i | le | ki'a | ctuca  
---|---|---|---  
| The | which | teacher?  
Which teacher?  
---  
  

Here, the second speaker does not understand the referent of the sumti _le ctuca_ , and so echoes back the sumti with the confusion marker.
The metalinguistic negation cmavo __na'i__ and its opposite __jo'a__ are explained in full in Chapter 15. In general, __na'i__ indicates that there is something wrong with a piece of discourse: either an error, or a false underlying assumption, or something else of the sort. The discourse is invalid or inappropriate due to the marked word or construct.
Similarly, __jo'a__ marks something which looks wrong but is in fact correct. These two cmavo constitute a scale, but are kept apart for two reasons: _na'inai_ means the same as __jo'a__ , but would be too confusing as an affirmation; _jo'anai_ means the same as __na'i__ , but is too long to serve as a convenient metalinguistic negator.
The next two cmavo are used to assist in quoting texts written or spoken by others. It is often the case that we wish to quote only part of a text, or to supply additional material either by way of commentary or to make a fragmentary text grammatical. The cmavo __li'o__ serves the former function. It indicates that words were omitted from the quotation. What remains of the quotation must be grammatical, however, as __li'o__ does not serve any grammatical function. It cannot, for example, take the place of a missing selbri in a bridi, or supply the missing tail of a description sumti: _le li'o_ in isolation is not grammatical.
The cmavo __sa'a__ indicates in a quotation that the marked word or construct was not actually expressed, but is inserted for editorial, narrative, or grammatical purposes. Strictly, even a __li'o__ should appear in the form _li'osa'a_ , since the __li'o__ was not part of the original quotation. In practice, this and other forms which are already associated with metalinguistic expressions, such as __sei__ (of selma'o SEI) or __to'i__ (of selma'o TO) need not be marked except where confusion might result.
In the rare case that the quoted material already contains one or more instances of __sa'a__ , they can be changed to _sa'asa'a_.
The cmavo __xu__ marks truth questions, which are discussed in detail in Section 15.8. In general, __xu__ may be translated “Is it true that ... ?” and questions whether the attached bridi is true. When __xu__ is attached to a specific word or construct, it directs the focus of the question to that word or construct.
Lojban question words, unlike those of English, frequently do not stand at the beginning of the question. Placing the cmavo __pau__ at the beginning of a bridi helps the listener realize that the bridi is a question, like the symbol at the beginning of written Spanish questions that looks like an upside-down question mark. The listener is then warned to watch for the actual question word.
Although __pau__ is grammatical in any location (like all indicators), it is not really useful except at or near the beginning of a bridi. Its scalar opposite, __paunai__ , signals that a bridi is not really a question despite its form. This is what we call in English a rhetorical question: an example appears in the English text near the beginning of Section 13.11.
The cmavo __pe'a__ is the indicator of figurative speech, indicating that the previous word should be taken figuratively rather than literally:
**Example 13.91. **
mi | viska | le | blanu | pe'a | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | blue | [figurative] | house.  
I see the “blue” house.  
---  
  

Here the house is not blue in the sense of color, but in some other sense, whose meaning is entirely culturally dependent. The use of __pe'a__ unambiguously marks a cultural reference: __blanu__ in Example 13.91 could mean “sad” (as in English) or something completely different.
The negated form, _pe'anai_ , indicates that what has been said is to be interpreted literally, in the usual way for Lojban; natural-language intuition is to be ignored.
Alone among the cmavo of selma'o UI, __pe'a__ has a rafsi, namely _pev_. This rafsi is used in forming figurative (culturally dependent) lujvo, whose place structure need have nothing to do with the place structure of the components. Thus _risnyjelca_ (heart burn) might have a place structure like:
> x1 is the heart of x2, burning in atmosphere x3 at temperature x4
whereas _pevrisnyjelca_ , explicitly marked as figurative, might have the place structure:
> x1 is indigestion/heartburn suffered by x2
which obviously has nothing to do with the places of either __risna__ or __jelca__.
The uses of __bi'u__ and __bi'unai__ correspond to one of the uses of the English articles “the” and “a/an”. An English-speaker telling a story may begin with “I saw a man who ...”. Later in the story, the same man will be referred to with the phrase “the man”. Lojban does not use its articles in the same way: both “a man” and “the man” would be translated _le nanmu_ , since the speaker has in mind a specific man. However, the first use might be marked _le bi'u nanmu_ , to indicate that this is a new man, not mentioned before. Later uses could correspondingly be tagged _le bi'unai nanmu_.
Most of the time, the distinction between __bi'u__ and __bi'unai__ need not be made, as the listener can infer the right referent. However, if a different man were referred to still later in the story, _le bi'u nanmu_ would clearly show that this man was different from the previous one.
Finally, the indicator __ge'e__ has been discussed in Section 13.8 and Section 13.10. It is used to express an attitude which is not covered by the existing set, or to avoid expressing any attitude.
Another use for __ge'e__ is to explicitly avoid expressing one's feeling on a given scale; in this use, it functions like a member of selma'o CAI: _.iige'e_ means roughly “I'm not telling whether I'm afraid or not.”
kau |  indirect question  
---|---  
This cmavo is explained in detail in Section 11.8. It marks the word it is attached to as the focus of an indirect question:
**Example 13.92. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | dakau | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of | somebody-[indirect?] | goes | to-the | store.  
I know who goes to the store.

## 11.10. Lojban sumti raising
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
tu'a |  LAhE |  an abstraction involving  
---|---|---  
jai |  JAI |  abstraction conversion  
It is sometimes inconvenient, in a situation where an abstract description is logically required, to express the abstraction. In English we can say:
**Example 11.64. **
I try to open the door.
  

which in Lojban is:
**Example 11.65. **
mi | troci | le | nu | [mi] | gasnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | try | the | event-of | (I | am-agent-in  
le | nu | le | vorme | cu | karbi'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | (the | door |  | open-becomes)).  
  

which has an abstract description within an abstract description, quite a complex structure. In English (but not in all other languages), we may also say:
**Example 11.66. **
I try the door.
  

where it is understood that what I try is actually not the door itself, but the act of opening it. The same simplification can be done in Lojban, but it must be marked explicitly using a cmavo. The relevant cmavo is __tu'a__ , which belongs to selma'o LAhE. The Lojban equivalent of Example 11.66 is:
**Example 11.67. **
mi | troci | tu'a | le | vorme  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | try | some-action-to-do-with | the | door.  
  

The term “sumti-raising”, as in the title of this section, signifies that a sumti which logically belongs within an abstraction (or even within an abstraction which is itself inside an intermediate abstraction) is “raised” to the main bridi level. This transformation from Example 11.65 to Example 11.67 loses information: nothing except convention tells us what the abstraction was.
Using __tu'a__ is a kind of laziness: it makes speaking easier at the possible expense of clarity for the listener. The speaker must be prepared for the listener to respond something like:
**Example 11.68. **
tu'a | le | vorme | lu'u | ki'a  
---|---|---|---|---  
something-to-do-with | the | door | [terminator] | [confusion!]  
  

which indicates that _tu'a le vorme_ cannot be understood. (The terminator for __tu'a__ is __lu'u__ , and is used in Example 11.68 to make clear just what is being questioned: the sumti-raising, rather than the word __vorme__ as such.) An example of a confusing raised sumti might be:
**Example 11.69. **
tu'a | la | djan. | cu | cafne  
---|---|---|---|---  
something-to-do-with | that-named | John |  | frequently-occurs  
  

This must mean that something which John does, or which happens to John, occurs frequently: but without more context there is no way to figure out what. Note that without the __tu'a__ , Example 11.69 would mean that John considered as an event frequently occurs – in other words, that John has some sort of on-and-off existence! Normally we do not think of people as events in English, but the x1 place of __cafne__ is an event, and if something that does not seem to be an event is put there, the Lojbanic listener will attempt to construe it as one. (Of course, this analysis assumes that _djan._ is the name of a person, and not the name of some event.)
Logically, a counterpart of some sort is needed to __tu'a__ which transposes an abstract sumti into a concrete one. This is achieved at the selbri level by the cmavo __jai__ (of selma'o JAI). This cmavo has more than one function, discussed in Section 9.12 and Section 10.22; for the purposes of this chapter, it operates as a conversion of selbri, similarly to the cmavo of selma'o SE. This conversion changes
**Example 11.70. **
tu'a | mi | rinka | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
something-to-do-with | me | causes | the | event-of | you | are-dead  
My action causes your death.  
---  
  

into
**Example 11.71. **
mi | jai | rinka | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-associated-with | causing | the | event-of | your | death.  
I cause your death.  
---  
  

In English, the subject of “cause” can either be the actual cause (an event), or else the agent of the cause (a person, typically); not so in Lojban, where the x1 of __rinka__ is always an event. Example 11.70 and Example 11.71 look equally convenient (or inconvenient), but in making descriptions, Example 11.71 can be altered to:
**Example 11.72. **
le | jai | rinka | be | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-which-is | associated-with | causing | ( | the | event-of | your | death | )  
the one who caused your death  
---  
  

because __jai__ modifies the selbri and can be incorporated into the description – not so for __tu'a__.
The weakness of __jai__ used in descriptions in this way is that it does not specify which argument of the implicit abstraction is being raised into the x1 place of the description selbri. One can be more specific by using the modal form of __jai__ explained in Section 9.12:
**Example 11.73. **
le | jai gau | rinka | be | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-which-is | agent-in | causing | ( | the | event-of | your | death | )

## 9.14. Sticky modals
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
ki |  KI |  stickiness flag  
---|---|---  
Like tenses, modals can be made persistent from the bridi in which they appear to all following bridi. The effect of this “stickiness” is to make the modal, along with its following sumti, act as if it appeared in every successive bridi. Stickiness is put into effect by following the modal (but not any following sumti) with the cmavo __ki__ of selma'o KI. For example,
**Example 9.88. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban. | bai  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban | compelled-by  
ki | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
| some-property-of | that-named | Frank.  
.ibabo | mi | tavla | bau | la | gliban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Afterward, | I | speak | in-language | that-named | English.  
  

means the same as:
**Example 9.89. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban. | bai  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban | compelled-by  
tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---  
some-property-of | that-named | Frank.  
.ibabo | mi | tavla | bau | la | gliban. | bai  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Afterward, | I | speak | in-language | that-named | English | compelled-by  
tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---  
some-property-of | that-named | Frank.  
  

In Example 9.88, __bai__ is made sticky, and so Frank's compelling is made applicable to every following bridi. __bau__ is not sticky, and so the language may vary from bridi to bridi, and if not specified in a particular bridi, no assumption can safely be made about its value.
To cancel stickiness, use the form _BAI ki ku_ , which stops any modal value for the specified BAI from being passed to the next bridi. To cancel stickiness for all modals simultaneously, and also for any sticky tenses that exist (__ki__ is used for both modals and tenses), use __ki__ by itself, either before the selbri or (in the form _ki ku_) anywhere in the bridi:
**Example 9.90. **
mi | ki | tavla  
---|---|---  
I speak (no implication about language or compulsion).  
---  
  

Note: Modals made with __fi'o__ -plus-selbri cannot be made sticky. This is an unfortunate, but unavoidable, restriction.

## 10.10. Event contours: ZAhO and _re'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
pu'o |  ZAhO |  inchoative  
---|---|---  
ca'o |  ZAhO |  continuitive  
ba'o |  ZAhO |  perfective  
co'a |  ZAhO |  initiative  
co'u |  ZAhO |  cessitive  
mo'u |  ZAhO |  completitive  
za'o |  ZAhO |  superfective  
co'i |  ZAhO |  achievative  
de'a |  ZAhO |  pausative  
di'a |  ZAhO |  resumptive  
re'u |  ROI |  ordinal tense  
The cmavo of selma'o ZAhO express the Lojban version of what is traditionally called “aspect”. This is not a notion well expressed by English tenses, but many languages (including Chinese and Russian among Lojban's six source languages) consider it more important than the specification of mere position in time.
The “event contours” of selma'o ZAhO, with their bizarre keywords, represent the natural portions of an event considered as a process, an occurrence with an internal structure including a beginning, a middle, and an end. Since the keywords are scarcely self-explanatory, each ZAhO will be explained in detail here. Note that from the viewpoint of Lojban syntax, ZAhOs are interval modifiers like TAhEs or ROI compounds; if both are found in a single tense, the TAhE/ROI comes first and the ZAhO afterward. The imaginary journey described by other tense cmavo moves us to the portion of the event-as-process which the ZAhO specifies.
It is important to understand that ZAhO cmavo, unlike the other tense cmavo, specify characteristic portions of the event, and are seen from an essentially timeless perspective. The “beginning” of an event is the same whether the event is in the speaker's present, past, or future. It is especially important not to confuse the speaker-relative viewpoint of the PU tenses with the event-relative viewpoint of the ZAhO tenses.
The cmavo __pu'o__ , __ca'o__ , and __ba'o__ (etymologically derived from the PU cmavo) refer to an event that has not yet begun, that is in progress, or that has ended, respectively:
**Example 10.51. **
mi | pu'o | damba  
---|---|---  
I | [inchoative] | fight.  
I'm on the verge of fighting.  
---  
  

**Example 10.52. **
la | stiv. | ca'o | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | Steve | [continuitive] | utters.  
Steve continues to talk.  
---  
  

**Example 10.53. **
le | verba | ba'o | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | child | [perfective] | walks-on | the | ice.  
The child is finished walking on the ice.  
---  
  

As discussed in Section 10.6, the simple PU cmavo make no assumptions about whether the scope of a past, present, or future event extends into one of the other tenses as well. Example 10.51 through Example 10.53 illustrate that these ZAhO cmavo do make such assumptions possible: the event in Example 10.51 has not yet begun, definitively; likewise, the event in Example 10.53 is definitely over.
Note that in Example 10.51 and Example 10.53, __pu'o__ and __ba'o__ may appear to be reversed: __pu'o__ , although etymologically connected with __pu__ , is referring to a future event; whereas __ba'o__ , connected with __ba__ , is referring to a past event. This is the natural result of the event-centered view of ZAhO cmavo. The inchoative, or __pu'o__ , part of an event, is in the “pastward” portion of that event, when seen from the perspective of the event itself. It is only by inference that we suppose that Example 10.51 refers to the speaker's future: in fact, no PU tense is given, so the inchoative part of the event need not be coincident with the speaker's present: __pu'o__ is not necessarily, though in fact often is, the same as _ca pu'o_.
The cmavo in Example 10.51 through Example 10.53 refer to spans of time. There are also two points of time that can be usefully associated with an event: the beginning, marked by __co'a__ , and the end, marked by __co'u__. Specifically, __co'a__ marks the boundary between the __pu'o__ and __ca'o__ parts of an event, and __co'u__ marks the boundary between the __ca'o__ and __ba'o__ parts:
**Example 10.54. **
mi | ba | co'a | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | [initiative] | eat | the | associated-with-me | meal.  
I will begin to eat my meal.  
---  
  

**Example 10.55. **
mi | pu | co'u | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [cessitive] | eat | the | associated-with-me | meal.  
I ceased eating my meal.  
---  
  

Compare Example 10.54 with:
**Example 10.56. **
mi | ba | di'i | co'a | bajra  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | [regularly] | [initiative] | run.  
I will regularly begin to run.  
---  
  

which illustrates the combination of a TAhE with a ZAhO.
A process can have two end points, one reflecting the “natural end” (when the process is complete) and the other reflecting the “actual stopping point” (whether complete or not). Example 10.55 may be contrasted with:
**Example 10.57. **
mi | pu | mo'u | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [completitive] | eat | the | associated-with-me | meal.  
I finished eating my meal.  
---  
  

In Example 10.57, the meal has reached its natural end; in Example 10.55, the meal has merely ceased, without necessarily reaching its natural end.
A process such as eating a meal does not necessarily proceed uninterrupted. If it is interrupted, there are two more relevant point events: the point just before the interruption, marked by __de'a__ , and the point just after the interruption, marked by __di'a__. Some examples:
**Example 10.58. **
mi | pu | de'a | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [pausative] | eat | the | associated-with-me | meal.  
I stopped eating my meal (with the intention of resuming).  
---  
  

**Example 10.59. **
mi | ba | di'a | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | [resumptive] | eat | the | associated-with-me | meal.  
I will resume eating my meal.  
---  
  

In addition, it is possible for a process to continue beyond its natural end. The span of time between the natural and the actual end points is represented by __za'o__ :
**Example 10.60. **
le | ctuca | pu | za'o | ciksi  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | teacher | [past] | [superfective] | explained  
le | cmaci | seldanfu | le | tadgri  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | mathematics | problem | to-the | student-group.  
The teacher kept on explaining the mathematics problem to the class too long.  
---  
  

That is, the teacher went on explaining after the class already understood the problem.
An entire event can be treated as a single moment using the cmavo __co'i__ :
**Example 10.61. **
la | djan. | pu | co'i | catra | la | djim  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | [achievative] | kills | that-named | Jim.  
John was at the point in time where he killed Jim.  
---  
  

Finally, since an activity is cyclical, an individual cycle can be referred to using a number followed by __re'u__ , which is the other cmavo of selma'o ROI:
**Example 10.62. **
mi | pare'u | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [first-time] | go-to | the | store.  
I go to the store for the first time (within a vague interval).  
---  
  

Note the difference between:
**Example 10.63. **
mi | pare'u | paroi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [first-time] | [one-time] | go-to | the | store.  
For the first time, I go to the store once.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.64. **
mi | paroi | pare'u | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [one-time] | [first-time] | go-to | the | store.  
There is one occasion on which I go to the store for the first time.

## 10.5. Interval sizes: VEhA and ZEhA
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ve'i |  VEhA |  short space interval  
---|---|---  
ve'a |  VEhA |  medium space interval  
ve'u |  VEhA |  long space interval  
ze'i |  ZEhA |  short time interval  
ze'a |  ZEhA |  medium time interval  
ze'u |  ZEhA |  long time interval  
So far, we have considered only events that are usually thought of as happening at a particular point in space and time: a man biting a dog at a specified place and time. But Lojbanic events may be much more “spread out” than that: _mi vasxu_ (I breathe) is something which is true during the whole of my life from birth to death, and over the entire part of the earth where I spend my life. The cmavo of VEhA (for space) and ZEhA (for time) can be added to any of the tense constructs we have already studied to specify the size of the space or length of the time over which the bridi is claimed to be true.
**Example 10.23. **
le | verba | ve'i | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | child | [small-space-interval] | walks-on | the | ice.  
In a small space, the child walks on the ice.  
---  
The child walks about a small area of the ice.  
  

means that her walking was done in a small area. Like the distances, the interval sizes are classified only roughly as “small, medium, large”, and are relative to the context: a small part of a room might be a large part of a table in that room.
Here is an example using a time interval:
**Example 10.24. **
le | verba | ze'a | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | child | [medium-time-interval] | walks-on | the | ice.  
For a medium time, the child walks/walked/will walk on the ice.  
---  
  

Note that with no time direction word, Example 10.24 does not say when the walking happened: that would be determined by context. It is possible to specify both directions or distances and an interval, in which case the interval always comes afterward:
**Example 10.25. **
le | verba | pu | ze'a | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | child | [past] | [medium-time-interval] | walks-on | the | ice.  
For a medium time, the child walked on the ice.  
---  
The child walked on the ice for a while.  
  

In Example 10.25, the relationship of the interval to the specified point in time or space is indeterminate. Does the interval start at the point, end at the point, or is it centered on the point? By adding an additional direction cmavo after the interval, this question can be conclusively answered:
**Example 10.26. **
mi | ca | ze'ica | cusku | dei  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | [short-time-interval-present] | express | this-utterance.  
I am now saying this sentence.  
---  
  

means that for an interval starting a short time in the past and extending to a short time in the future, I am expressing the utterance which is Example 10.26. Of course, “short” is relative, as always in tenses. Even a long sentence takes up only a short part of a whole day; in a geological context, the era of _Homo sapiens_ would only be a __ze'i__ interval.
By contrast,
**Example 10.27. **
mi | ca | ze'ipu | cusku | dei  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | [short-time-interval-past] | express | this-utterance.  
I have just been saying this sentence.  
---  
  

means that for a short time interval extending from the past to the present I have been expressing Example 10.27. Here the imaginary journey starts at the present, lays down one end point of the interval, moves into the past, and lays down the other endpoint. Another example:
**Example 10.28. **
mi | pu | ze'aba | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [medium-time-interval-future] | eat | the | of-me | meal.  
For a medium time afterward, I ate my meal.  
---  
I ate my meal for a while.  
  

With __ca__ instead of __ba__ , Example 10.28 becomes Example 10.29,
**Example 10.29. **
mi | pu | ze'aca | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [medium-time-interval-present] | eat | the | of-me | meal.  
For a medium time before and afterward, I ate my meal.  
---  
I ate my meal for a while.  
  

because the interval would then be centered on the past moment rather than oriented toward the future of that moment. The colloquial English translations are the same – English is not well-suited to representing this distinction.
Here are some examples of the use of space intervals with and without specified directions:
**Example 10.30. **
ta | ri'u | ve'i | finpe  
---|---|---|---  
That-there | [right] | [short-space-interval] | is-a-fish.  
That thing on my right is a fish.  
---  
  

In Example 10.30, there is no equivalent in the colloquial English translation of the “small interval” which the fish occupies. Neither the Lojban nor the English expresses the orientation of the fish. Compare Example 10.31:
**Example 10.31. **
ta | ri'u | ve'ica'u | finpe  
---|---|---|---  
That-there | [right] | [short-space-interval-front] | is-a-fish.  
That thing on my right extending forwards is a fish.  
---  
  

Here the space interval occupied by the fish extends from a point on my right to another point in front of the first point.

## 18.9. Approximation and inexact numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ji'i |  PA |  approximately  
---|---|---  
su'e |  PA |  at most  
su'o |  PA |  at least  
me'i |  PA |  less than  
za'u |  PA |  more than  
The cmavo __ji'i__ (of selma'o PA) is used in several ways to indicate approximate or rounded numbers. If it appears at the beginning of a number, the whole number is approximate:
**Example 18.60. **
ji'i | vo | no  
---|---|---  
approximation | four | zero  
approximately 40  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears in the middle of a number, all the digits following it are approximate:
**Example 18.61. **
vo | no | ji'i | mu | no  
---|---|---|---|---  
four | zero | approximation | five | zero  
roughly 4050 (where the “four thousand” is exact, but the “fifty” is approximate)  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears at the end of a number, it indicates that the number has been rounded. In addition, it can then be followed by a sign cmavo (__ma'u__ or __ni'u__), which indicate truncation towards positive or negative infinity respectively.
**Example 18.62. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation  
2.72 (rounded)  
---  
  

**Example 18.63. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i | ma'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation | positive-sign  
2.72 (rounded up)  
---  
  

**Example 18.64. **
re | pi | ze | pa | ji'i | ni'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | one | approximation | negative-sign  
2.71 (rounded down)  
---  
  

Example 18.62 through Example 18.64 are all approximations to __te'o__ (exponential e). __ji'i__ can also appear by itself, in which case it means “approximately the typical value in this context”.
The four cmavo __su'e__ , __su'o__ , __me'i__ , and __za'u__ , also of selma'o PA, express inexact numbers with upper or lower bounds:
**Example 18.65. **
mi | catlu | su'e | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-most | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.66. **
mi | catlu | su'o | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.67. **
mi | catlu | me'i | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | less-than | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.68. **
mi | catlu | za'u | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | more-than | two | persons  
  

Each of these is a subtly different claim: Example 18.66 is true of two or any greater number, whereas Example 18.68 requires three persons or more. Likewise, Example 18.65 refers to zero, one, or two; Example 18.67 to zero or one. (Of course, when the context allows numbers other than non-negative integers, _me'i re_ can be any number less than 2, and likewise with the other cases.) The exact quantifier, “exactly 2, neither more nor less” is just __re__. Note that _su'ore_ is the exact Lojban equivalent of English plurals.
If no number follows one of these cmavo, __pa__ is understood: therefore,
**Example 18.69. **
mi | catlu | su'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least-[one] | person  
  

is a meaningful claim.
Like the numbers in Section 18.8, all of these cmavo may be preceded by __pi__ to make the corresponding quantifiers for part of a whole. For example, __pisu'o__ means “at least some part of”. The quantifiers __ro__ , __su'o__ , __piro__ , and __pisu'o__ are particularly important in Lojban, as they are implicitly used in the descriptions introduced by the cmavo of selma'o LA and LE, as explained in Section 6.7. Descriptions in general are outside the scope of this chapter.

## 6.6. Quantified sumti
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ro |  PA |  all of/each of  
---|---|---  
su'o |  PA |  at least (one of)  
Quantifiers tell us how many: in the case of quantifiers with sumti, how many things we are talking about. In Lojban, quantifiers are expressed by numbers and mathematical expressions: a large topic discussed in some detail in Chapter 18. For the purposes of this chapter, a simplified treatment will suffice. Our examples will employ either the simple Lojban numbers __pa__ , __re__ , __ci__ , __vo__ , and __mu__ , meaning “one”, “two”, “three”, “four”, “five” respectively, or else one of four special quantifiers, two of which are discussed in this section and listed above. These four quantifiers are important because every Lojban sumti has either one or two of them implicitly present in it – which one or two depends on the particular kind of sumti. There is more explanation of implicit quantifiers later in this section. (The other two quantifiers, __piro__ and __pisu'o__ , are explained in Section 6.7.)
Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit quantifier. The purpose of this quantifier is to specify how many of the things referred to by the sumti are being talked about. Here are some simple examples contrasting sumti with and without explicit quantifiers:
**Example 6.30. **
do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---  
You | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

**Example 6.31. **
re | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
Two-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

The difference between Example 6.30 and Example 6.31 is the presence of the explicit quantifier __re__ in the latter example. Although __re__ by itself means “two”, when used as a quantifier it means “two-of”. Out of the group of listeners (the number of which isn't stated), two (we are not told which ones) are asserted to be “walkers on the ice”. Implicitly, the others (if any) are not walkers on the ice. In Lojban, you cannot say “I own three shoes” if in fact you own four shoes. Numbers need never be specified, but if they are specified they must be correct.
(This rule does not mean that there is no way to specify a number which is vague. The sentence
**Example 6.32. **
mi | ponse | su'o | ci | cutci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | at-least | three | shoes.  
  

is true if you own three shoes, or four, or indeed any larger number. More details on vague numbers appear in the discussion of mathematical expressions in Chapter 18.)
Now consider Example 6.30 again. How many of the listeners are claimed to walk on the ice? The answer turns out to be: all of them, however many that is. So Example 6.30 and Example 6.33:
**Example 6.33. **
ro | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
All-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

turn out to mean exactly the same thing. This is a safe strategy, because if one of my listeners doesn't turn out to be walking on the ice, I can safely claim that I didn't intend that person to be a listener! And in fact, all of the personal pro-sumti such as __mi__ and __mi'o__ and __ko__ obey the same rule. We say that personal pro-sumti have a so-called “implicit quantifier” of __ro__ (all). This just means that if no quantifier is given explicitly, the meaning is the same as if the implicit quantifier had been used.
Not all sumti have __ro__ as the implicit quantifier, however. Consider the quotation in:
**Example 6.34. **
mi | cusku | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say, “You walk on the ice.”  
---  
  

What is the implicit quantifier of the quotation _lu do cadzu le bisli li'u_? Surely not __ro__. If __ro__ were supplied explicitly, thus:
**Example 6.35. **
mi | cusku | ro | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | all-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

the meaning would be something like “I say every occurrence of the sentence 'You walk on the ice'”. Of course I don't say every occurrence of it, only some occurrences. One might suppose that Example 6.34 means that I express exactly one occurrence, but it is more Lojbanic to leave the number unspecified, as with other sumti. We can say definitely, however, that I say it at least once.
The Lojban cmavo meaning “at least” is __su'o__ , and if no ordinary number follows, __su'o__ means “at least once”. (See Example 6.32 for the use of __su'o__ with an ordinary number). Therefore, the explicitly quantified version of Example 6.34 is
**Example 6.36. **
mi | cusku | su'o | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | at-least-one-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say one or more instances of “You walk on the ice”.  
---  
I say “You walk on the ice”.  
  

If an explicit ordinary number such as __re__ were to appear, it would have to convey an exact expression, so
**Example 6.37. **
mi | cusku | re | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | two-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

means that I say the sentence exactly twice, neither more nor less.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 14.9. Compound bridi
So far we have seen how to handle two sentences that need have no similarity at all (bridi connection) and sentences that are identical except for a difference in one sumti (sumti connection). It would seem natural to ask how to logically connect sentences that are identical except for having different selbri.
Surprise! Lojban provides no logical connective that is designed to handle selbri and nothing else. Instead, selbri connection is provided as part of a more general-purpose mechanism called “compound bridi”. Compound bridi result from logically connecting sentences that differ in their selbri and possibly some of their sumti.
The simplest cases result when the x1 sumti is the only common point:
**Example 14.49. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | .ije | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market, | and | I | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to the compound bridi:
**Example 14.50. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

As Example 14.50 indicates, giheks are used in afterthought to create compound bridi; __gi'e__ is the gihek corresponding to “and”. The actual phrases _klama le zarci_ and _nelci la djan._ that the gihek connects are known as “bridi-tails”, because they represent (in this use) the “tail end” of a bridi, including the selbri and any following sumti, but excluding any sumti that precede the selbri:
**Example 14.51. **
mi | ricfu | gi'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-rich | and | go-to | the | market.  
  

In Example 14.51, the first bridi-tail is __ricfu__ , a simple selbri, and the second bridi-tail is _klama le zarci_ , a selbri with one following sumti.
Suppose that more than a single sumti is identical between the two sentences:
**Example 14.52. **
mi | dunda | le | cukta | do | .ije | mi | lebna | lo | rupnu | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | give | the | book | to-you, | and | I | take | some | currency-units | from-you.  
  

In Example 14.52, the first and last sumti of each bridi are identical; the selbri and the second sumti are different. By moving the final sumti to the beginning, a form analogous to Example 14.50 can be achieved:
**Example 14.53. **
fi | do | fa | mi | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
to/from | you |  | I | give | the | book  
gi'e | lebna | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---  
and | take | some | currency-units.  
  

where the __fi__ does not have an exact English translation because it merely places __do__ in the third place of both __lebna__ and __dunda__. However, a form that preserves natural sumti order also exists in Lojban. Giheks connect two bridi-tails, but also allow sumti to be added following the bridi-tail. These sumti are known as tail-terms, and apply to both bridi. The straightforward gihek version of Example 14.52 therefore is:
**Example 14.54. **
mi | dunda | le | cukta | gi'e | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | (give | the | book) | and | (take | some | currency-units) |  | to/from-you.  
  

The __vau__ (of selma'o VAU) serves to separate the bridi-tail from the tail-terms. Every bridi-tail is terminated by an elidable __vau__ , but only in connection with compound bridi is it ever necessary to express this __vau__. Thus:
**Example 14.55. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | [vau]  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market.  
  

has a single elided __vau__ , and Example 14.50 is equivalent to:
**Example 14.56. **
mi klama le zarci [vau] gi'e nelci la djan. [vau] [vau]
  

where the double __vau__ at the end of Example 14.56 terminates both the right-hand bridi-tail and the unexpressed tail-terms.
A final use of giheks is to combine bridi-tails used as complete sentences, the Lojban observative:
**Example 14.57. **
klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Since x1 is omitted in both of the bridi underlying Example 14.57, this compound bridi does not necessarily imply that the goer and the walker are the same. Only the presence of an explicit x1 (other than __zo'e__ , which is equivalent to omission) can force the goer and the walker to be identical.
A strong argument for this convention is provided by analysis of the following example:
**Example 14.58. **
klama | la | nu,IORK.  
---|---|---  
A-goer | to-that-named | New-York  
la | finyks.  
---|---  
from-that-named | Phoenix  
gi'e | klama | la | nu,IORK.  
---|---|---|---  
and | a-goer | to-that-named | New-York  
la | rom.  
---|---  
from-that-named | Rome.  
  

If the rule were that the x1 places of the two underlying bridi were considered identical, then (since there is nothing special about x1), the unspecified x4 (route) and x5 (means) places would also have to be the same, leading to the absurd result that the route from Phoenix to New York is the same as the route from Rome to New York. Inserting __da__ , meaning roughly “something”, into the x1 place cures the problem:
**Example 14.59. **
da | klama | la | nu,IORK. | la | finyks.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Something | is-a-goer | to-that-named | New-York | from-that-named | Phoenix  
gi'e | klama | la | nu,IORK. | la | rom.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | is-a-goer | to-that-named | New-York | from-that-named | Rome.  
  

The syntax of giheks is:
> [na] [se] GIhA [nai] 
which is exactly parallel to the syntax of eks.

## 16.8. The problem of “any”
Consider the English sentence 
**Example 16.47. **
Anyone who goes to the store, walks across the field.
  

Using the facilities already discussed, a plausible translation might be
**Example 16.48. **
ro | da | poi | klama | le | zarci | cu | cadzu | le | foldi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | X | such-that-it | goes-to | the | store |  | walks-on | the | field.  
Everyone who goes to the store walks across the field.  
---  
  

But there is a subtle difference between Example 16.47 and Example 16.48. Example 16.48 tells us that, in fact, there are people who go to the store, and that they walk across the field. A sumti of the type _ro da poi klama_ requires that there are things which __klama__ : Lojban universal claims always imply the corresponding existential claims as well. Example 16.47, on the other hand, does not require that there are any people who go to the store: it simply states, conditionally, that if there is anyone who goes to the store, he or she walks across the field as well. This conditional form mirrors the true Lojban translation of Example 16.47:
**Example 16.49. **
ro | da | zo'u | da | go | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X | : | X | if-and-only-if | it-is-a-goer-to | the | store  
gi | cadzu | le | foldi  
---|---|---|---  
| is-a-walker-on | the | field.  
  

Although Example 16.49 is a universal claim as well, its universality only implies that there are objects of some sort or another in the universe of discourse. Because the claim is conditional, nothing is implied about the existence of goers-to-the-store or of walkers-on-the-field, merely that any entity which is one is also the other.
There is another use of “any” in English that is not universal but existential. Consider
**Example 16.50. **
I need any box that is bigger than this one.
  

Example 16.50 does not at all mean that I need every box bigger than this one, for indeed I do not; I require only one box. But the naive translation
**Example 16.51. **
mi | nitcu | da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | some-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-one  
  

does not work either, because it asserts that there really is such a box, as the prenex paraphrase demonstrates:
**Example 16.52. **
da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti | zo'u | mi | nitcu | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this | : | I | need | X.  
  

What to do? Well, the x2 place of __nitcu__ can be filled with an event as well as an object, and in fact Example 16.51 can also be paraphrased as:
**Example 16.53. **
mi | nitcu | lo | nu | mi | ponse | lo | tanxe  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | an | event-of | I | possess | some | box(es)  
poi | bramau | ti  
---|---|---  
which-are | bigger-than | this-one.  
  

Rewritten using variables, Example 16.53 becomes
**Example 16.54. **
mi | nitcu | lo | nu | da | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | an | event-of | there-being-an-X | such-that:  
da | se | ponse | mi  
---|---|---|---  
X |  | is-possessed-by | me  
gi'e | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-thing.  
  

So we see that a prenex can be attached to a bridi that is within a sentence. By default, a variable always behaves as if it is bound in the prenex which (notionally) is attached to the smallest enclosing bridi, and its scope does not extend beyond that bridi. However, the variable may be placed in an outer prenex explicitly:
**Example 16.55. **
da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-one | such-that:  
mi | nitcu | le | nu | mi | ponse | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | the | event-of | my | possessing | X.  
  

But what are the implications of Example 16.53 and Example 16.55? The main difference is that in Example 16.55, the __da__ is said to exist in the real world of the outer bridi; but in Example 16.53, the existence is only within the inner bridi, which is a mere event that need not necessarily come to pass. So Example 16.55 means
**Example 16.56. **
There's a box, bigger than this one, that I need
  

which is what Example 16.52 says, whereas Example 16.53 turns out to be an effective translation of our original Example 16.47. So uses of “any” that aren't universal end up being reflected by variables bound in the prenex of a subordinate bridi.

## 9.4. Conversion: SE
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
se |  SE |  2nd place conversion  
---|---|---  
te |  SE |  3rd place conversion  
ve |  SE |  4th place conversion  
xe |  SE |  5th place conversion  
So far we have seen ways to move sumti around within a bridi, but the actual place structure of the selbri has always remained untouched. The conversion cmavo of selma'o SE are incorporated within the selbri itself, and produce a new selbri (called a converted selbri) with a different place structure. In particular, after the application of any SE cmavo, the number and purposes of the places remain the same, but two of them have been exchanged, the x1 place and another. Which place has been exchanged with x1 depends on the cmavo chosen. Thus, for example, when __se__ is used, the x1 place is swapped with the x2 place.
Note that the cmavo of SE begin with consecutive consonants in alphabetical order. There is no “1st place conversion” cmavo, because exchanging the x1 place with itself is a pointless maneuver.
Here are the place structures of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the destination of x2's going from x3 via x4 using x5
and _te klama_ :
> x1 is the origin and x2 the destination of x3 going via x4 using x5
and _ve klama_ :
> x1 is the route to x2 from x3 used by x4 going via x5
and _xe klama_ :
> x1 is the means in going to x2 from x3 via x4 employed by x5
Note that the place structure numbers in each case continue to be listed in the usual order, x1 to x5.
Consider the following pair of examples:
**Example 9.18. **
la | bastn. | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Boston |  | is-the-destination | of-me.  
Boston is my destination.  
---  
Boston is gone to by me.  
  

**Example 9.19. **
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I.  
To Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.18 and Example 9.19 mean the same thing, in the sense that there is a relationship of going with the speaker as the agent and Boston as the destination (and with unspecified origin, route, and means). Structurally, however, they are quite different. Example 9.18 has _la bastn._ in the x1 place and __mi__ in the x2 place of the selbri _se klama_ , and uses standard bridi order; Example 9.19 has __mi__ in the x1 place and _la bastn._ in the x2 place of the selbri __klama__ , and uses a non-standard order.
The most important use of conversion is in the construction of descriptions. A description is a sumti which begins with a cmavo of selma'o LA or LE, called the descriptor, and contains (in the simplest case) a selbri. We have already seen the descriptions _le dargu_ and _le karce_. To this we could add:
**Example 9.20. **
le | klama  
---|---  
the go-er, the one who goes  
---  
  

In every case, the description is about something which fits into the x1 place of the selbri. In order to get a description of a destination (that is, something fitting the x2 place of __klama__), we must convert the selbri to _se klama_ , whose x1 place is a destination. The result is
**Example 9.21. **
le | se | klama  
---|---|---  
the destination gone to by someone  
---  
  

Likewise, we can create three more converted descriptions:
**Example 9.22. **
le | te | klama  
---|---|---  
the origin of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.23. **
le | ve | klama  
---|---|---  
the route of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.24. **
le | xe | klama  
---|---|---  
the means by which someone goes  
---  
  

Example 9.23 does not mean “the route” plain and simple: that is _le pluta_ , using a different selbri. It means a route that is used by someone for an act of __klama__ ; that is, a journey with origin and destination. A “road” on Mars, on which no one has traveled or is ever likely to, may be called _le pluta_ , but it cannot be _le ve klama_ , since there exists no one for whom it is _le ve klama be fo da_ (the route taken in an actual journey by someone [da]).
When converting selbri that are more complex than a single brivla, it is important to realize that the scope of a SE cmavo is only the following brivla (or equivalent unit). In order to convert an entire tanru, it is necessary to enclose the tanru in __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets:
**Example 9.25. **
mi | se | ke | blanu | zdani | [ke'e] | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [2nd-conversion] | ( | blue | house | ) | this-thing  
  

The place structure of _blanu zdani_ (blue house) is the same as that of __zdani__ , by the rule given in Section 9.1. The place structure of __zdani__ is:
> _ _zdani_ _ x1 is a house/nest/lair/den for inhabitant x2
The place structure of _se ke blanu zdani [ke'e]_ is therefore:
> x1 is the inhabitant of the blue house (etc.) x2
Consequently, Example 9.25 means:
> I am the inhabitant of the blue house which is this thing.
Conversion applied to only part of a tanru has subtler effects which are explained in Section 5.11.
It is grammatical to convert a selbri more than once with SE; later (inner) conversions are applied before earlier (outer) ones. For example, the place structure of _se te klama_ is achieved by exchanging the x1 and x2 place of _te klama_ , producing:
> x1 is the destination and x2 is the origin of x3 going via x4 using x5
On the other hand, _te se klama_ has a place structure derived from swapping the x1 and x3 places of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the origin of x2's going to x3 via x4 using x5
which is quite different. However, multiple conversions like this are never necessary. Arbitrary scrambling of places can be achieved more easily and far more intelligibly with FA tags, and only a single conversion is ever needed in a description.
(Although no one has made any real use of it, it is perhaps worth noting that compound conversions of the form _setese_ , where the first and third cmavo are the same, effectively swap the two given places while leaving the others, including x1, alone: _setese_ (or equivalently _tesete_) swap the x2 and x3 places, whereas _texete_ (or _xetexe_) swap the x3 and x5 places.)

## 5.11. Conversion of simple selbri
Conversion is the process of changing a selbri so that its places appear in a different order. This is not the same as labeling the sumti with the cmavo of FA, as mentioned in Section 5.7, and then rearranging the order in which the sumti are spoken or written. Conversion transforms the selbri into a distinct, though closely related, selbri with renumbered places.
In Lojban, conversion is accomplished by placing a cmavo of selma'o SE before the selbri:
**Example 5.109. **
mi | prami | do  
---|---|---  
I love you.  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 5.110. **
do | se | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---  
You | [swap x1 and x2] | love | me.  
You are loved by me.  
---  
  

Conversion is fully explained in Section 9.4. For the purposes of this chapter, the important point about conversion is that it applies only to the following simple selbri. When trying to convert a tanru, therefore, it is necessary to be careful! Consider Example 5.111:
**Example 5.111. **
la | .alis. | cu | cadzu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | is-a-walker | type-of-goer-to | the | market.  
That-named | Alice |  | walkingly | goes-to | the | market.  
Alice walks to the market.  
---  
  

To convert this sentence so that _le zarci_ is in the x1 place, one correct way is:
**Example 5.112. **
le | zarci | cu | se  
---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-a-[swap x1/x2]  
The | market |  |   
ke | cadzu | klama | [ke'e] | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | walker | type-of-goer-to | ) | that-named | Alice.  
| is-walkingly | gone-to-by |  | that-named | Alice.  
  

The __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets cause the entire tanru to be converted by the __se__ , which would otherwise convert only __cadzu__ , leading to:
**Example 5.113. **
le | zarci | cu | se | cadzu  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | (is-a-[swap x1/x2] | walker)  
The | market |  |  | is-a-walking-surface  
klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
  

whatever that might mean. An alternative approach, since the place structure of _cadzu klama_ is that of __klama__ alone, is to convert only the latter:
**Example 5.114. **
le | zarci | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice.  
  

But the tanru in Example 5.114 may or may not have the same meaning as that in Example 5.111; in particular, because __cadzu__ is not converted, there is a suggestion that although Alice is the goer, the market is the walker. With a different sumti as x1, this seemingly odd interpretation might make considerable sense:
**Example 5.115. **
la | djan. | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice  
  

suggests that Alice is going to John, who is a moving target.
There is an alternative type of conversion, using the cmavo __jai__ of selma'o JAI optionally followed by a modal or tense construction. Grammatically, such a combination behaves exactly like conversion using SE. More details can be found in Section 9.12.

## 10.22. Conversion of sumti tcita: JAI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
jai |  JAI |  tense conversion  
---|---|---  
fai |  FA |  indefinite place  
Conversion is the regular Lojban process of moving around the places of a place structure. The cmavo of selma'o SE serve this purpose, exchanging the first place with one of the others:
**Example 10.162. **
mi | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | go-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.163. **
le | zarci | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-gone-to | by-me.  
  

It is also possible to bring a place that is specified by a sumti tcita (for the purposes of this chapter, a tense sumti tcita) to the front, by using __jai__ plus the tense as the grammatical equivalent of SE:
**Example 10.164. **
le | ratcu | cu | citka | le | cirla | vi | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | rat |  | eats | the | cheese | [short-distance] | the | park.  
The rat eats the cheese in the park.  
---  
  

**Example 10.165. **
le | panka | cu | jai vi | citka | le | cirla | fai | le | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | park |  | is-the-place-of | eating | the | cheese | by | the | rat.  
The park is where the rat eats the cheese.  
---  
  

In Example 10.165, the construction JAI+tense converts the location sumti into the first place. The previous first place has nowhere to go, since the location sumti is not a numbered place; however, it can be inserted back into the bridi with __fai__ , the indefinite member of selma'o FA.
(The other members of FA are used to mark the first, second, etc. places of a bridi explicitly:
**Example 10.166. **
fa mi cu klama fe le zarci
  

means the same as
**Example 10.167. **
fe le zarci cu klama fa mi
  

as well as the simple
**Example 10.168. **
mi cu klama le zarci
  

in which the place structure is determined by position.)
Like SE conversion, JAI+tense conversion is especially useful in descriptions with LE selma'o:
**Example 10.169. **
mi | viska | le | jai vi | citka | be | le | cirla  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | place-of | eating |  | the | cheese.  
  

Here the eater of the cheese is elided, so no __fai__ appears.
Of course, temporal tenses are also usable with JAI:
**Example 10.170. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | jai | ca | morsi | be | fai | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the |  | [present] | is-dead |  | of | that-named |  “John” | .  
I know the time of John's death.  
---  
I know when John died.

## 9.12. Modal conversion: JAI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
jai |  JAI |  modal conversion  
---|---|---  
fai |  FA |  modal place structure tag  
So far, conversion of numbered bridi places with SE and the addition of modal places with BAI have been two entirely separate operations. However, it is possible to convert a selbri in such a way that, rather than exchanging two numbered places, a modal place is made into a numbered place. For example,
**Example 9.82. **
mi | cusku |  | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | [something] | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

has an explicit x1 place occupied by __mi__ and an explicit __bau__ place occupied by _la lojban._ To exchange these two, we use a modal conversion operator consisting of __jai__ (of selma'o JAI) followed by the modal cmavo. Thus, the modal conversion of Example 9.82 is:
**Example 9.83. **
la | lojban. | jai bau cusku | fai | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Lojban | is-the-language-of-expression | used-by | me.  
  

In Example 9.83, the modal place _la lojban._ has become the x1 place of the new selbri _jai bau cusku_. What has happened to the old x1 place? There is no numbered place for it to move to, so it moves to a special “unnumbered place” marked by the tag __fai__ of selma'o FA.
Note: For the purposes of place numbering, __fai__ behaves like __fi'a__ ; it does not affect the numbering of the other places around it.
Like SE conversions, JAI conversions are especially convenient in descriptions. We may refer to “the language of an expression” as _le jai bau cusku_ , for example.
In addition, it is grammatical to use __jai__ without a following modal. This usage is not related to modals, but is explained here for completeness. The effect of __jai__ by itself is to send the x1 place, which should be an abstraction, into the __fai__ position, and to raise one of the sumti from the abstract sub-bridi into the x1 place of the main bridi. This feature is discussed in more detail in Section 11.10. The following two examples mean the same thing:
**Example 9.84. **
le | nu | mi | lebna | le | cukta | cu | se krinu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | (I | take | the | book) |  | is-justified-by  
le | nu | mi | viska | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | (I | see | the | book).  
My taking the book is justified by my seeing it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.85. **
mi | jai se krinu | le | nu | mi | viska | le | cukta | kei  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-justified-by | the | event-of | (I | see | the | book) |   
[fai | le | nu | mi | lebna | le | cukta]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[namely, | the | event-of | (I | take | the | book)]  
I am justified in taking the book by seeing the book.  
---  
  

Example 9.85, with the bracketed part omitted, allows us to say that “I am justified” whereas in fact it is my action that is justified. This construction is vague, but useful in representing natural-language methods of expression.
Note: The uses of modals discussed in this section are applicable both to BAI modals and to _fi'o-_ plus-selbri modals.

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  
I'm worn out by your continuous talking.  
---  
  

**Example 13.27. **
.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  
I'm putting you to bed.  
---  
  

**Example 13.28. **
.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.  
---  
  

**Example 13.29. **
.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  
I hope I feel better tomorrow!  
---  
  

**Example 13.30. **
.au | mi | sipna  
---|---|---  
[desire] | I | sleep.  
I want to sleep.  
---  
  

**Example 13.31. **
.a'ucu'i | do | pante  
---|---|---  
[no-interest] | you | complain.  
I have no interest in your complaints.  
---  
  

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  
I feel up to dealing with you.  
---  
  

**Example 13.34. **
.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  
I should fill the car's gas tank.  
---  
  

**Example 13.35. **
.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  
---|---|---|---  
[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  
Please take care of yourself!  
---  
  

**Example 13.36. **
.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  
I suggest going to the park.  
---  
  

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  
I can't believe you thought you could fool me.  
---  
  

**Example 13.38. **
do | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  
I blame you for not coming home.  
---  
  

**Example 13.39. **
.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  
le | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  
It's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  
---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  
---

## 2.12. The sumti _di'u_ and _la'e di'u_
In English, I might say “The dog is beautiful”, and you might reply “This pleases me.” How do you know what “this” refers to? Lojban uses different expressions to convey the possible meanings of the English:
**Example 2.50. **
le gerku |  [ku] |  cu |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
The dog is beautiful.  
---  
  

The following three sentences all might translate as “This pleases me.”
**Example 2.51. **
ti |  [cu] |  pluka |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This (the dog) pleases me.  
---  
  

**Example 2.52. **
di'u |  [cu] |  pluka |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This (the last sentence) pleases me (perhaps because it is grammatical or sounds nice).  
---  
  

**Example 2.53. **
la'e di'u |  [cu] |  pluka |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This (the meaning of the last sentence; i.e. that the dog is beautiful) pleases me.  
---  
  

Example 2.53 uses one sumti to point to or refer to another by inference. It is common to write __la'edi'u__ as a single word; it is used more often than __di'u__ by itself.

## 16.6. Variables with generalized quantifiers
So far, we have seen variables with either nothing in front, or with the cmavo __ro__ in front. Now __ro__ is a Lojban number, and means “all”; thus _ro prenu_ means “all persons”, just as _re prenu_ means “two persons”. In fact, unadorned __da__ is also taken to have an implicit number in front of it, namely __su'o__ , which means “at least one”. Why is this? Consider Example 16.9 again, this time with an explicit __su'o__ :
**Example 16.33. **
su'o | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-at-least-one | X | : | X | sees | me.  
Something sees me.  
---  
  

From this version of Example 16.9, we understand the speaker's claim to be that of all the things that there are, at least one of them sees him or her. The corresponding universal claim, Example 16.16, says that of all the things that exist, every one of them can see the speaker.
Any other number can be used instead of __ro__ or __su'o__ to precede a variable. Then we get claims like:
**Example 16.34. **
re | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-two | Xes | : | X | sees | me.  
Two things see me.  
---  
  

This means that exactly two things, no more or less, saw the speaker on the relevant occasion. In English, we might take “Two things see me” to mean that at least two things see the speaker, but there might be more; in Lojban, though, that claim would have to be made as:
**Example 16.35. **
su'ore | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-at-least-two | Xes | : | X | sees | me.  
  

which would be false if nothing, or only one thing, saw the speaker, but not otherwise. We note the __su'o__ here meaning “at least”; __su'o__ by itself is short for _su'opa_ where __pa__ means “one”, as is explained in Section 18.9.
The prenex may be removed from Example 16.34 and Example 16.35 as from the others, leading to:
**Example 16.36. **
re | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---  
Two | Xes | see | me.  
  

and
**Example 16.37. **
su'ore | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---  
At-least-two | Xes | see | me.  
  

respectively, subject to the rules prescribed in Section 16.5.
Now we can explain the constructions _ro prenu_ for “all persons” and _re prenu_ for “two persons” which were casually mentioned at the beginning of this Section. In fact, _ro prenu_ , a so-called “indefinite description”, is shorthand for _ro DA poi prenu_ , where “DA” represents a fictitious variable that hasn't been used yet and will not be used in future. (Even if all three of __da__ , __de__ , and __di__ have been used up, it does not matter, for there are ways of getting more variables, discussed in Section 16.14.) So in fact
**Example 16.38. **
re | prenu | cu | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
Two | persons |  | see | me.  
  

is short for
**Example 16.39. **
re | da | poi | prenu | cu | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | Xes | which | are-persons |  | see | me.  
  

which in turn is short for:
**Example 16.40. **
re | da | poi | prenu | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-two | Xes | which | are-persons | : | X | sees | me.  
  

Note that when we move more than one variable to the prenex (along with its attached relative clause), we must make sure that the variables are in the same order in the prenex as in the bridi proper.

## 14.7. More than two propositions
So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.
Of the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,
**Example 14.31. **
mi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,
**Example 14.32. **
mi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that one or more of the component sentences is true.
O, however, is different. Working out the truth table for
**Example 14.33. **
mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  
  

shows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:
> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.
Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.
In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.
There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: 
**Example 14.34. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  
.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

Does this mean:
**Example 14.35. **
I like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.
  

Or is the correct translation:
**Example 14.36. **
Either I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.
  

Example 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:
**Example 14.37. **
ga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | I | like | that-named | Martha)  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas
**Example 14.38. **
ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary).  
  

is not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.

## 14.8. Grouping of afterthought connectives
There are several ways in Lojban to render Example 14.35 using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo __bo__ (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with __bo__ are interpreted before connections not so marked. Example 14.39 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.38:
**Example 14.39. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John, | and | I | like | that-named | Martha  
.ijabo | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by __.i__ __ja__ first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by __.i__ __je__.
Eks can have __bo__ attached in exactly the same way, so that Example 14.40 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39:
**Example 14.40. **
mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with __bo__ , for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.
What happens if __bo__ is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in Example 14.41?
**Example 14.41. **
mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Does this wind up meaning the same as Example 14.34 and Example 14.36? Not at all. A second rule relating to __bo__ is that where several __bo__ -marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, Example 14.41 in fact means the same as Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with __bo__ should be avoided.
The use of __bo__ , therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of Example 14.37 and Example 14.38, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ are used with ijeks, and __ke__ and __ke'e__ with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (__ke__ and __ke'e__ are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.42. **
I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
  

where the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express Example 14.42 in afterthought, we can say:
**Example 14.43. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije[bo] | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me,  
.ijanai | mi | prami | do | .ijebo | do | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | I | love | you | and | you | love | me.  
  

marking two of the ijeks with __bo__ for high precedence. (The first __bo__ is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)
But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:
**Example 14.44. **
tu'e | mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me | )  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

where the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ pairs set off the structure. The cmavo __tu'u__ is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in Example 14.44 is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.
In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to __bo__ grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.
Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:
**Example 14.45. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider
**Example 14.46. **
I walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.
  

Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to Example 14.44, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with __ke__ , so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing Example 14.47, which is instead parallel to Example 14.45:
**Example 14.47. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | the | house  
.a | ke | le | ckule | .e | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | the | school | and | the | office | ).  
  

If sumti were allowed to begin with __ke__ , unavoidable ambiguities would result, so __ke__ grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to __tu'e__ grouping of bridi, as Example 14.44 shows.
Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of Example 14.33: “I am German, rich, and a man – or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:
**Example 14.48. **
[tu'e] | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-rich | )  
.ije | tu'e | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | nanmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | ( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-a-man | ).  
  

The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.

## 7.3. Demonstrative pro-sumti: the ti-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ti |  KOhA |  ti-series |  this here, a nearby object   
---|---|---|---  
ta |  KOhA |  ti-series |  that there, a medium-distant object  
tu |  KOhA |  ti-series |  that yonder, a far-distant object  
It is often useful to refer to things by pointing to them or by some related non-linguistic mechanism. In English, the words “this” and “that” serve this function among others: “this” refers to something pointed at that is near the speaker, and “that” refers to something further away. The Lojban pro-sumti of the ti-series serve the same functions, but more narrowly. The cmavo __ti__ , __ta__ , and __tu__ provide only the pointing function of “this” and “that”; they are not used to refer to things that cannot be pointed at.
There are three pro-sumti of the ti-series rather than just two because it is often useful to distinguish between objects that are at more than two different distances. Japanese, among other languages, regularly does this. Until the 16th century, English did too; the pronoun “that” referred to something at a medium distance from the speaker, and the now-archaic pronoun “yon” to something far away.
In conversation, there is a special rule about __ta__ and __tu__ that is often helpful in interpreting them. When used contrastingly, __ta__ refers to something that is near the listener, whereas __tu__ refers to something far from both speaker and listener. This makes for a parallelism between __ti__ and __mi__ , and __ta__ and __do__ , that is convenient when pointing is not possible; for example, when talking by telephone. In written text, on the other hand, the meaning of the ti-series is inherently vague; is the writer to be taken as pointing to something, and if so, to what? In all cases, what counts as “near” and “far away” is relative to the current situation.
It is important to distinguish between the English pronoun “this” and the English adjective “this” as in “this boat”. The latter is not represented in Lojban by __ti__ :
**Example 7.11. **
le | ti | bloti  
---|---|---  
the | this | boat  
  

does not mean “this boat” but rather “this one's boat”, “the boat associated with this thing”, as explained in Section 8.7. A correct Lojban translation of Example 7.11 is
**Example 7.12. **
le | vi | bloti  
---|---|---  
the | here | boat  
the nearby boat  
---  
  

using a spatial tense before the selbri __bloti__ to express that the boat is near the speaker. (Tenses are explained in full in Chapter 10.) Another correct translation would be:
**Example 7.13. **
ti | noi | bloti  
---|---|---  
this-thing | which-incidentally | is-a-boat  
  

There are no demonstrative pro-bridi to correspond to the ti-series: you can't point to a relationship.

## 2.7. Varying the order of sumti
For one reason or another you may want to change the order, placing one particular sumti at the front of the bridi. The cmavo __se__ , when placed before the last word of the selbri, will switch the meanings of the first and second sumti places. So
**Example 2.21. **
mi |  tavla |  do |  ti  
---|---|---|---  
I talk to you about this.  
---  
  

has the same meaning as
**Example 2.22. **
do |  se tavla |  mi |  ti  
---|---|---|---  
You are talked to by me about this.  
---  
  

The cmavo __te__ , when used in the same location, switches the meanings of the first and the third sumti places.
**Example 2.23. **
mi |  tavla |  do |  ti  
---|---|---|---  
I talk to you about this.  
---  
  

has the same meaning as
**Example 2.24. **
ti |  te tavla |  do |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This is talked about to you by me.  
---  
  

Note that only the first and third sumti have switched places; the second sumti has remained in the second place.
The cmavo __ve__ and __xe__ switch the first and fourth sumti places, and the first and fifth sumti places, respectively. These changes in the order of places are known as “conversions”, and the __se__ , __te__ , __ve__ , and __xe__ cmavo are said to convert the selbri.
More than one of these operators may be used on a given selbri at one time, and in such a case they are evaluated from left to right. However, in practice they are used one at a time, as there are better tools for complex manipulation of the sumti places. See Section 9.4 for details.
The effect is similar to what in English is called the “passive voice”. In Lojban, the converted selbri has a new place structure that is renumbered to reflect the place reversal, thus having effects when such a conversion is used in combination with other constructs such as _le selbri [ku]_ (see Section 2.10).

## 7.9. sumti and bridi questions: _ma_ and _mo_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ma |  KOhA |  sumti question  
---|---|---  
mo |  GOhA |  bridi question  
Lojban questions are more fully explained in Section 19.5, but __ma__ and __mo__ are listed in this chapter for completeness. The cmavo __ma__ asks for a sumti to make the bridi true:
**Example 7.63. **
do | klama | ma  
---|---|---  
You | go-to | what?  
Where are you going?  
---  
  

The cmavo __mo__ , on the other hand, asks for a selbri which makes the question bridi true. If the answer is a full bridi, then the arguments of the answer override the arguments in the question, in the same manner as the go'i-series cmavo. A simple example is:
**Example 7.64. **
do mo  
---  
What predicate is true as applied to you?  
---  
How are you?  
What are you doing?  
What are you?  
  

Example 7.65 is a truly pregnant question that will have several meanings depending on context.
(One thing it probably does not mean is “Who are you?” in the sense “What is your name/identity?”, which is better expressed by:
**Example 7.65. **
ma | cmene | do  
---|---|---  
What-sumti | is-the-name-of | you?  
What is your name?  
---  
  

or even
**Example 7.66. **
doi | ma  
---|---  
O | [what sumti?]  
  

which uses the vocative __doi__ to address someone, and simultaneously asks who the someone is.)
A further example of __mo__ :
**Example 7.67. **
lo | mo |  | prenu | cu | darxi | do | .i | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | [what selbri?] | type-of | person |  | hit | you? |  | A big thing.  
Which person hit you? The big one.  
---  
  

When __ma__ or __mo__ is repeated, multiple questions are being asked simultaneously:
**Example 7.68. **
ma | djuno | ma  
---|---|---  
[What-sumti] | knows | [what-sumti]?  
Who knows what?  
---

## 19.5. Questions and answers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
xu |  UI |  truth question  
---|---|---  
ma |  KOhA |  sumti question  
mo |  GOhA |  bridi question  
xo |  PA |  number question  
ji |  A |  sumti connective question  
ge'i |  GA |  forethought connective question  
gi'i |  GIhA |  bridi-tail connective question  
gu'i |  GUhA |  tanru forethought connective question  
je'i |  JA |  tanru connective question  
pei |  UI |  attitude question  
fi'a |  FA |  place structure question  
cu'e |  CUhE |  tense/modal question  
pau |  UI |  question premarker  
Lojban questions are not at all like English questions. There are two basic types: truth questions, of the form “Is it true that ...”, and fill-in-the-blank questions. Truth questions are marked by preceding the bridi, or following any part of it specifically questioned, with the cmavo __xu__ (of selma'o UI):
**Example 19.13. **
xu | do | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
[True-or-false?] | You | go-to | the | store  
Are you going to the store/Did you go to the store?  
---  
  

(Since the Lojban is tenseless, either colloquial translation might be correct.) Truth questions are further discussed in Section 15.8.
Fill-in-the-blank questions have a cmavo representing some Lojban word or phrase which is not known to the questioner, and which the answerer is to supply. There are a variety of cmavo belonging to different selma'o which provide different kinds of blanks.
Where a sumti is not known, a question may be formed with __ma__ (of selma'o KOhA), which is a kind of pro-sumti:
**Example 19.14. **
ma | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
[What-sumti?] | goes-to | the | store  
Who is going to the store?  
---  
  

Of course, the __ma__ need not be in the x1 place:
**Example 19.15. **
do | klama | ma  
---|---|---  
You | go-to | [what-sumti?]  
Where are you going?  
---  
  

The answer is a simple sumti:
**Example 19.16. **
le zarci  
---  
The store.  
---  
  

A sumti, then, is a legal utterance, although it does not by itself constitute a bridi – it does not claim anything, but merely completes the open-ended claim of the previous bridi.
There can be two __ma__ cmavo in a single question:
**Example 19.17. **
ma klama ma  
---  
Who goes where?  
---  
  

and the answer would be two sumti, which are meant to fill in the two __ma__ cmavo in order:
**Example 19.18. **
mi | le | zarci  
---|---|---  
I, | [to]-the | store.  
  

An even more complex example, depending on the non-logical connective __fa'u__ (of selma'o JOI), which is like the English “and ... respectively”:
**Example 19.19. **
ma | fa'u | ma | klama | ma | fa'u | ma  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Who and who goes where and where, -respectively?  
---  
  

An answer might be
**Example 19.20. **
la | djan. | la | marcas. | le | zarci | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John, |  | Marsha, | the | store, | the | office.  
John and Marsha go to the store and the office, respectively.  
---  
  

(Note: A mechanical substitution of Example 19.20 into Example 19.19 produces an ungrammatical result, because _* ... le zarci fa'u le briju_ is ungrammatical Lojban: the first _le zarci_ has to be closed with its proper terminator __ku__ , for reasons explained in Section 14.14. This effect is not important: Lojban behaves as if all elided terminators have been supplied in both question and answer before inserting the latter into the former. The exchange is grammatical if question and answer are each separately grammatical.)
Questions to be answered with a selbri are expressed with __mo__ of selma'o GOhA, which is a kind of pro-bridi:
**Example 19.21. **
la | lojban. | mo  
---|---|---  
| Lojban | [what-selbri?]  
What is Lojban?  
---  
  

Here the answerer is to supply some predicate which is true of Lojban. Such questions are extremely open-ended, due to the enormous range of possible predicate answers. The answer might be just a selbri, or might be a full bridi, in which case the sumti in the answer override those provided by the questioner. To limit the range of a __mo__ question, make it part of a tanru.
Questions about numbers are expressed with __xo__ of selma'o PA:
**Example 19.22. **
do | viska | xo | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
You | saw | [what-number?] | persons.  
How many people did you see?  
---  
  

The answer would be a simple number, another kind of non-bridi utterance:
**Example 19.23. **
vomu  
---  
Forty-five.  
  

Fill-in-the-blank questions may also be asked about: logical connectives (using cmavo __ji__ of A, __ge'i__ of GA, __gi'i__ of GIhA, __gu'i__ of GUhA, or __je'i__ of JA, and receiving an ek, gihek, ijek, or ijoik as an answer) – see Section 14.13; attitudes (using __pei__ of UI, and receiving an attitudinal as an answer) – see Section 13.10; place structures (using __fi'a__ of FA, and receiving a cmavo of FA as an answer) – see Section 9.3; tenses and modals (using __cu'e__ of CUhE, and receiving any tense or BAI cmavo as an answer) – see Section 9.6 and Chapter 10.
Questions can be marked by placing __pau__ (of selma'o UI) before the question bridi. See Section 13.13 for details.
The full list of non-bridi utterances suitable as answers to questions is:
  * any number of sumti (with elidable terminator __vau__ , see Chapter 6)
  * an ek or gihek (logical connectives, see Chapter 14)
  * a number, or any mathematical expression placed in parentheses (see Chapter 18)
  * a bare __na__ negator (to negate some previously expressed bridi), or corresponding __ja'a__ affirmer (see Chapter 15)
  * a relative clause (to modify some previously expressed sumti, see Chapter 8)
  * a prenex/topic (to modify some previously expressed bridi, see Chapter 16)
  * linked arguments (beginning with __be__ or __bei__ and attached to some previously expressed selbri, often in a description, see Section 5.7)


At the beginning of a text, the following non-bridi are also permitted:
  * one or more names (to indicate direct address without __doi__ , see Chapter 6)
  * indicators (to express a prevailing attitude, see Chapter 13)
  * __nai__ (to vaguely negate something or other, see Section 15.7)


Where not needed for the expression of answers, most of these are made grammatical for pragmatic reasons: people will say them in conversation, and there is no reason to rule them out as ungrammatical merely because most of them are vague.

## 7.6. Anaphoric pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the ri-series and the go'i-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ri |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats last sumti)   
---|---|---|---  
ra |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats previous sumti)  
ru |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats long-ago sumti)  
go'i |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last bridi)  
go'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats previous bridi)  
go'u |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats long-ago bridi)  
go'e |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last-but-one bridi)  
go'o |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats future bridi)  
nei |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats current bridi)  
no'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats outer bridi)  
ra'o |  RAhO |  |  pro-cmavo update  
The term “anaphora” literally means “repetition”, but is used in linguistics to refer to pronouns whose significance is the repetition of earlier words, namely their antecedents. Lojban provides three pro-sumti anaphora, __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ ; and three corresponding pro-bridi anaphora, __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__. These cmavo reveal the same vowel pattern as the ti-series, but the “distances” referred to are not physical distances, but distances from the anaphoric cmavo to its antecedent.
The cmavo __ri__ is the simplest of these; it has the same referent as the last complete sumti appearing before the __ri__ :
**Example 7.30. **
la | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | ri | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | [repeat-last-sumti] | room.  
Alice sleeps in her room.  
---  
  

The __ri__ in Example 7.30 is equivalent to repeating the last sumti, which is _la .alis._ , so Example 7.30 is equivalent to:
**Example 7.31. **
la | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | la | .alis. | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | that-named | Alice | room.  
Alice sleeps in Alice's room.  
---  
  

Note that __ri__ does not repeat _le ri kumfa_ , because that sumti is not yet complete when __ri__ appears. This prevents __ri__ from getting entangled in paradoxes of self-reference. (There are plenty of other ways to do that!) Note also that sumti within other sumti, as in quotations, abstractions, and the like, are counted in the order of their beginnings; thus a lower level sumti like _la alis._ in Example 7.31 is considered to be more recent than a higher level sumti that contains it.
Certain sumti are ignored by __ri__ ; specifically, most of the other cmavo of KOhA, and the almost-grammatically-equivalent lerfu words of selma'o BY. It is simpler just to repeat these directly:
**Example 7.32. **
mi | prami | mi  
---|---|---  
I | love | me.  
I love myself.  
---  
  

However, the cmavo of the ti-series can be picked up by __ri__ , because you might have changed what you are pointing at, so repeating __ti__ may not be effective. Likewise, __ri__ itself (or rather its antecedent) can be repeated by a later __ri__ ; in fact, a string of __ri__ cmavo with no other intervening sumti always all repeat the same sumti:
**Example 7.33. **
la | djan. | viska | le | tricu | .i  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | sees | the | tree. |   
ri | se jadni | le |  | ri | jimca  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[repeat-last] | is-adorned-by | the | of- | [repeat-last] | branch.  
John sees the tree. It is adorned by its branches.  
---  
  

Here the second __ri__ has as antecedent the first __ri__ , which has as antecedent _le tricu_. All three refer to the same thing: a tree.
To refer to the next-to-last sumti, the third-from-last sumti, and so on, __ri__ may be subscripted (subscripts are explained in Section 19.6):
**Example 7.34. **
lo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | rixire  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [repeat-next-to-last].  
.i | la | .alis. | pilno | riximu  
---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | uses | [repeat-fifth-from-last].  
  

Here _rixire_ , or “ri-sub-2”, skips _la rik._ to reach _lo forca_. In the same way, _riximu_ , or “ri-sub-5”, skips _la .alis._ , _rixire_ , _la rik._ , and _lo forca_ to reach _lo smuci_. As can clearly be seen, this procedure is barely practicable in writing, and would break down totally in speech.
Therefore, the vaguer __ra__ and __ru__ are also provided. The cmavo __ra__ repeats a recently used sumti, and __ru__ one that was further back in the speech or text. The use of __ra__ and __ru__ forces the listener to guess at the referent, but makes life easier for the speaker. Can __ra__ refer to the last sumti, like __ri__? The answer is no if __ri__ has also been used. If __ri__ has not been used, then __ra__ might be the last sumti. Likewise, if __ra__ has been used, then any use of __ru__ would repeat a sumti earlier than the one __ra__ is repeating. A more reasonable version of Example 7.34, but one that depends more on context, is:
**Example 7.35. **
lo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | ra  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [some-previous-thing].  
.i | la | .alis. | pilno | ru  
---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | uses | [some-more-remote-thing].  
  

In Example 7.35, the use of __ra__ tells us that something other than _la rik._ is the antecedent; _lo forca_ is the nearest sumti, so it is probably the antecedent. Similarly, the antecedent of __ru__ must be something even further back in the utterance than _lo forca_ , and _lo smuci_ is the obvious candidate.
The meaning of __ri__ must be determined every time it is used. Since __ra__ and __ru__ are more vaguely defined, they may well retain the same meaning for a while, but the listener cannot count on this behavior. To make a permanent reference to something repeated by __ri__ , __ra__ , or __ru__ , use __goi__ and a ko'a-series cmavo:
**Example 7.36. **
la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | goes-to | the | store  
.i | ri | goi | ko'a | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---  
. | It-last-mentioned | also-known-as | it-1 | is-blue.  
  

allows the store to be referred to henceforth as __ko'a__ without ambiguity. Example 7.36 is equivalent to Example 7.21 and eliminates any possibility of __ko'a__ being interpreted by the listener as referring to Alice.
The cmavo __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__ follow exactly the same rules as __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ , except that they are pro-bridi, and therefore repeat bridi, not sumti – specifically, main sentence bridi. Any bridi that are embedded within other bridi, such as relative clauses or abstractions, are not counted. Like the cmavo of the broda-series, the cmavo of the go'i-series copy all sumti with them. This makes __go'i__ by itself convenient for answering a question affirmatively, or for repeating the last bridi, possibly with new sumti:
**Example 7.37. **
xu | zo | .djan. | cmene | do | .i | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True-false?] | The-word |  “John” | is-the-name-of | you? |  | [repeat last bridi].  
Is John your name? Yes.  
---  
  

**Example 7.38. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | .i | do | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store | . | You | [repeat last bridi].  
I go to the store . You, too.  
---  
  

Note that Example 7.38 means the same as Example 7.26, but without the bother of assigning an actual broda-series word to the first bridi. For long-term reference, use _go'i cei broda_ or the like, analogously to _ri goi ko'a_ in Example 7.36.
The remaining four cmavo of the go'i-series are provided for convenience or for achieving special effects. The cmavo __go'e__ means the same as _go'ixire_ : it repeats the last bridi but one. This is useful in conversation:
**Example 7.39. **
A: | mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
A: | I | [future] | go-to | the | store.  
A: I am going to the store.  
---  
B: | mi | nelci | le | si'o | mi | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
B: | I | like | the | concept-of | I | [repeat-last-bridi].  
B: I like the idea of my going.  
---  
A: | do | go'e  
---|---|---  
A: | You | [repeat-last-bridi-but-one].  
A: You'll go, too.  
---  
  

Here B's sentence repeats A's within an abstraction (explained in Chapter 11): _le si'o mi go'i_ means _le si'o mi klama le zarci_. Why must B use the word __mi__ explicitly to replace the x1 of _mi klama le zarci_ , even though it looks like __mi__ is replacing __mi__? Because B's __mi__ refers to B, whereas A's __mi__ refers to A. If B said:
**Example 7.40. **
mi nelci le si'o go'i
  

that would mean:
> I like the idea of your going to the store.
The repetition signalled by __go'i__ is not literally of words, but of concepts. Finally, A repeats her own sentence, but with the x1 changed to __do__ , meaning B. Note that in Example 7.39, the tense __ba__ (future time) is carried along by both __go'i__ and __go'e__.
Descriptions based on go'i-series cmavo can be very useful for repeating specific sumti of previous bridi:
**Example 7.41. **
le | xekri | mlatu | cu | klama | le | zarci | .i | le  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | black | cat |  | goes-to | the | store. |  | That-described-as-the-x1-place-of  
go'i | cu | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
[repeat-last-bridi] |  | walks-on | the | ice.  
The black cat goes to the store. It walks on the ice.  
---  
  

Here the __go'i__ repeats _le xekri mlatu cu klama le zarci_ , and since __le__ makes the x1 place into a description, and the x1 place of this bridi is _le xekri mlatu_ , _le go'i_ means _le xekri mlatu_.
The cmavo __go'o__ , __nei__ , and __no'a__ have been little used so far. They repeat respectively some future bridi, the current bridi, and the bridi that encloses the current bridi (__no'a__ , unlike the other members of the go'i- series, can repeat non-sentence bridi). Here are a few examples:
**Example 7.42. **
mi | nupre | le | nu | mi | go'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | promise | the | event-of | I | [repeat-future-bridi].  
.i | ba | dunda | le | djini |  | le | bersa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [Future] | give | the | money | to | the | son  
.i | ba | dunda | le | zdani |  | le | tixnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [Future] | give | the | house | to | the | daughter  
I promise to do the following: Give the money to my son. Give the house to my daughter.  
---  
  

(Note: The Lojban does not contain an equivalent of the __my__ in the colloquial English; it leaves the fact that it is the speaker's son and daughter that are referred to implicit. To make the fact explicit, use _le bersa_ /_tixnu be mi_.)
For good examples of __nei__ and __no'a__ , we need nested bridi contexts:
**Example 7.43. **
mi | se | pluka | le | nu | do | pensi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | am-pleased-by | the | event-of | (you | think-about | the | (event-of  
nei | kei | pu | le | nu | do | zukte  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[main-bridi] | ) | before | the | (event-of | your | acting).  
I am pleased that you thought about whether I would be pleased (about ...) before you acted.  
---  
  

**Example 7.44. **
mi | ba | klama | ca | le | nu | do | no'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | go | [present] | the | event-of | you | [repeats outer bridi]  
I will go when you do.  
---  
  

Finally, __ra'o__ is a cmavo that can be appended to any go'i-series cmavo, or indeed any cmavo of selma'o GOhA, to signal that pro-sumti or pro-bridi cmavo in the antecedent are to be repeated literally and reinterpreted in their new context. Normally, any pro-sumti used within the antecedent of the pro-bridi keep their meanings intact. In the presence of __ra'o__ , however, their meanings must be reinterpreted with reference to the new environment. If someone says to you:
**Example 7.45. **
mi ba lumci le mi karce  
---  
I will wash my car.  
---  
  

you might reply either:
**Example 7.46. **
mi go'i  
---  
I will wash your car.  
---  
  

or:
**Example 7.47. **
mi go'i ra'o  
---  
I will wash my car.  
---  
  

The __ra'o__ forces the second __mi__ from the original bridi to mean the new speaker rather than the former speaker. This means that _go'e ra'o_ would be an acceptable alternative to _do go'e_ in B's statement in Example 7.39.
The anaphoric pro-sumti of this section can be used in quotations, but never refer to any of the supporting text outside the quotation, since speakers presumably do not know that they may be quoted by someone else.
However, a _ri-_ series or _go'a-_ series reference within a quotation can refer to something mentioned in an earlier quotation if the two quotations are closely related in time and context. This allows a quotation to be broken up by narrative material without interfering with the pro-sumti within it. Here's an example:
**Example 7.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | lu | mi | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | says | [quote] | I | go-to | the | store | [unquote].  
.i | la | .alis. | cusku | lu | mi | go'i | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | says | [quote] | I | [repeat] | [unquote].  
John says, “I am going to the store.” Alice says, “Me too.”  
---  
  

Of course, there is no problem with narrative material referring to something within a quotation: people who quote, unlike people who are quoted, are aware of what they are doing.

## 6.10. sumti qualifiers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
la'e |  LAhE |  something referred to by  
---|---|---  
lu'e |  LAhE |  a reference to  
tu'a |  LAhE |  an abstraction involving  
lu'a |  LAhE |  an individual/member/component of  
lu'i |  LAhE |  a set formed from  
lu'o |  LAhE |  a mass formed from  
vu'i |  LAhE |  a sequence formed from  
na'ebo |  NAhE+BO |  something other than  
to'ebo |  NAhE+BO |  the opposite of  
no'ebo |  NAhE+BO |  the neutral form of  
je'abo |  NAhE+BO |  that which indeed is  
lu'u |  LUhU |  elidable terminator for LAhE and NAhE+BO  
Well, that's quite a list of cmavo. What are they all about?
The above cmavo and compound cmavo are called the “sumti qualifiers”. All of them are either single cmavo of selma'o LAhE, or else compound cmavo involving a scalar negation cmavo of selma'o NAhE immediately followed by __bo__ of selma'o BO. Syntactically, you can prefix a sumti qualifier to any sumti and produce another simple sumti. (You may need to add the elidable terminator __lu'u__ to show where the qualified sumti ends.)
Semantically, sumti qualifiers represent short forms of certain common special cases. Suppose you want to say “I see 'The Red Pony'”, where “The Red Pony” is the title of a book. How about:
**Example 6.51. **
mi | viska | lu | le | xunre | cmaxirma | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | [quote] | the | red | small-horse | [unquote].  
  

But Example 6.51 doesn't work: it says that you see a piece of text “The Red Pony”. That might be all right if you were looking at the cover of the book, where the words “The Red Pony” are presumably written. (More precisely, where the words _le xunre cmaxirma_ are written – but we may suppose the book has been translated into Lojban.)
What you really want to say is:
**Example 6.52. **
mi | viska | le | selsinxa  
---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | thing-represented-by  
be | lu | le | xunre | cmaxirma | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [quote] | the | red | small-horse | [unquote].  
  

The x2 place of _selsinxa_ (the x1 place of __sinxa__) is a sign or symbol, and the x1 place of _selsinxa_ (the x2 place of __sinxa__) is the thing represented by the sign. Example 6.52 allows us to use a symbol (namely the title of a book) to represent the thing it is a symbol of (namely the book itself).
This operation turns out to be needed often enough that it's useful to be able to say:
**Example 6.53. **
mi | viska | la'e | lu | le | xunre | cmaxirma | li'u | [lu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the-referent-of | [quote] | the | red | small-horse | [unquote] | -.  
  

So when __la'e__ is prefixed to a sumti referring to a symbol, it produces a sumti referring to the referent of that symbol. (In computer jargon, __la'e__ dereferences a pointer.)
By introducing a sumti qualifier, we correct a false sentence (Example 6.51), which too closely resembles its literal English equivalent, into a true sentence (Example 6.53), without having to change it overmuch; in particular, the structure remains the same. Most of the uses of sumti qualifiers are of this general kind.
The sumti qualifier __lu'e__ provides the converse operation: it can be prefixed to a sumti referring to some thing to produce a sumti referring to a sign or symbol for the thing. For example,
**Example 6.54. **
mi | pu | cusku | lu'e | le | vi | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | express | a-symbol-for | the | nearby | book.  
I said the title of this book.  
---  
  

The equivalent form not using a sumti qualifier would be:
**Example 6.55. **
mi | pu | cusku | le | sinxa | be | le | vi | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | express | the | symbol-for |  | the | nearby | book.  
  

which is equivalent to Example 6.54, but longer.
The other sumti qualifiers follow the same rules. The cmavo __tu'a__ is used in forming abstractions, and is explained more fully in Section 11.11. The triplet __lu'a__ , __lu'i__ , and __lu'o__ convert between individuals, sets, and masses; __vu'i__ belongs to this group as well, but creates a sequence, which is similar to a set but has a definite order. (The set of John and Charles is the same as the set of Charles and John, but the sequences are different.) Here are some examples:
**Example 6.56. **
mi | troci | tu'a | le | vorme  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | try | some-abstraction-about | the | door.  
I try (to open) the door.  
---  
  

Example 6.56 might mean that I try to do something else involving the door; the form is deliberately vague.
Most of the following examples make use of the cmavo __ri__ , belonging to selma'o KOhA. This cmavo means “the thing last mentioned”; it is equivalent to repeating the immediately previous sumti (but in its original context). It is explained in more detail in Section 7.6.
**Example 6.57. **
lo'i | ratcu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---  
The-set-of | rats |  | is-large.  
.iku'i | lu'a | ri | cmalu  
---|---|---|---  
But | some-members-of | it-last-mentioned | are-small.  
The set of rats is large, but some of its members are small.  
---  
  

**Example 6.58. **
lo | ratcu | cu | cmalu | .iku'i | lu'i | ri | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | rats |  | are-small. | But | the-set-of | them-last-mentioned | is-large.  
Some rats are small, but the set of rats is large.  
---  
  

**Example 6.59. **
mi | ce | do | girzu  
---|---|---|---  
I | in-a-set-with | you | are-a-set.  
.i | lu'o | ri | gunma  
---|---|---|---  
| The-mass-of | it-last-mentioned | is-a-mass.  
.i | vu'i | ri | porsi  
| The-sequence-of | it-last-mentioned | is-a-sequence  
The set of you and me is a set. The mass of you and me is a mass. The sequence of you and me is a sequence.  
---  
  

(Yes, I know these examples are a bit silly. This set was introduced for completeness, and practical examples are as yet hard to come by.)
Finally, the four sumti qualifiers formed from a cmavo of NAhE and __bo__ are all concerned with negation, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 15. Here are a few examples of negation sumti qualifiers:
**Example 6.60. **
mi | viska | na'ebo | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | something-other-than | the | dog.  
  

This compound, _na'ebo_ , is the most common of the four negation sumti qualifiers. The others usually only make sense in the context of repeating, with modifications, something already referred to:
**Example 6.61. **
mi | nelci | loi | glare | cidja  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | part-of-the-mass-of | hot-type-of | food.  
.ije | do | nelci | to'ebo | ri  
---|---|---|---|---  
And | you | like | the-opposite-of | the-last-mentioned.  
.ije | la | djein. | nelci | no'ebo | ra  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
And | that-named | Jane | likes | the-neutral-value-of | something-mentioned.  
I like hot food, and you like cold food, and Jane likes lukewarm food.  
---  
  

(In Example 6.61, the sumti __ra__ refers to some previously mentioned sumti other than that referred to by __ri__. We cannot use __ri__ here, because it would signify _la djein._ , that being the most recent sumti available to __ri__. See more detailed explanations in Section 7.6.)

## 5.13. Tenses and bridi negation
A bridi can have cmavo associated with it which specify the time, place, or mode of action. For example, in
**Example 5.127. **
mi | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | go-to | the | market.  
I went to the market.  
---  
  

the cmavo __pu__ specifies that the action of the speaker going to the market takes place in the past. Tenses are explained in full detail in Chapter 10. Tense is semantically a property of the entire bridi; however, the usual syntax for tenses attaches them at the front of the selbri, as in Example 5.127. There are alternative ways of expressing tense information as well. Modals, which are explained in Chapter 9, behave in the same way as tenses.
Similarly, a bridi may have the particle __na__ (of selma'o NA) attached to the beginning of the selbri to negate the bridi. A negated bridi expresses what is false without saying anything about what is true. Do not confuse this usage with the scalar negation of Section 5.12. For example:
**Example 5.128. **
la | djonz. | na | pamoi | cusku  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Jones | (Not!) | is-the-first | speaker  
It is not true that Jones is the first speaker.  
---  
Jones isn't the first speaker.  
  

Jones may be the second speaker, or not a speaker at all; Example 5.128 doesn't say. There are other ways of expressing bridi negation as well; the topic is explained fully in Chapter 15.
Various combinations of tense and bridi negation cmavo are permitted. If both are expressed, either order is permissible with no change in meaning:
**Example 5.129. **
mi | na | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is false that I went to the market.  
---  
I didn't go to the market.  
  

It is also possible to have more than one __na__ , in which case pairs of __na__ cmavo cancel out:
**Example 5.130. **
mi | na | na | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is false that it is false that I go to the market.  
---  
I go to the market.  
  

It is even possible, though somewhat pointless, to have multiple __na__ cmavo and tense cmavo mixed together, subject to the limitation that two adjacent tense cmavo will be understood as a compound tense, and must fit the grammar of tenses as explained in Chapter 10.
**Example 5.131. **
mi | na | pu | na | ca | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [not] | [past] | [not] | [present] | go-to | the | market  
It is not the case that in the past it was not the case that in the present I went to the market.  
---  
I didn't not go to the market.  
I went to the market.  
  

Tense, modal, and negation cmavo can appear only at the beginning of the selbri. They cannot be embedded within it.

## 15.2. bridi negation
In discussing Lojban negation, we will call the form of logical negation that simply denies the truth of a statement “bridi negation”. Using bridi negation, we can say the equivalent of “I haven't stopped beating my wife” without implying that I ever started, nor even that I have a wife, meaning simply “It isn't true that I have stopped beating my wife.” Since Lojban uses bridi as smaller components of complex sentences, bridi negation is permitted in these components as well at the sentence level.
For the bridi negation of a sentence to be true, the sentence being negated must be false. A major use of bridi negation is in making a negative response to a yes/no question; such responses are usually contradictory, denying the truth of the entire sentence. A negative answer to
**Example 15.11. **
Did you go to the store?
  

is taken as a negation of the entire sentence, equivalent to
**Example 15.12. **
No, I didn't go to the store.
  

The most important rule about bridi negation is that if a bridi is true, its negation is false, and vice versa.
The simplest way to express a bridi negation is to use the cmavo __na__ of selma'o NA before the selbri of the affirmative form of the bridi (but after the __cu__ , if there is one):
**Example 15.13. **
mi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store.  
  

when negated becomes:
**Example 15.14. **
mi | na | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [false] | go-to | the | store.  
  

Note that we have used a special convention to show in the English that a bridi negation is present. We would like to use the word “not”, because this highlights the naturalness of putting the negation marker just before the selbri, and makes the form easier to learn. But there is a major difference between Lojban's bridi negation with __na__ and natural language negation with “not”. In English, the word “not” can apply to a single word, to a phrase, to an English predicate, or to the entire sentence. In addition, “not” may indicate either contradictory negation or another form of negation, depending on the sentence. Lojban's internal bridi negation, on the other hand, always applies to an entire bridi, and is always a contradictory negation; that is, it contradicts the claim of the whole bridi.
Because of the ambiguity of English “not”, we will use “[false]” in the translation of Lojban examples to remind the reader that we are expressing a contradictory negation. Here are more examples of bridi negation:
**Example 15.15. **
mi | [cu] | na | ca | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | [false] | now | am-a-go-er-to | the | market.  
I am not going to the market now.  
---  
  

**Example 15.16. **
lo | ca | nolraitru | be  
---|---|---|---  
The-actual | present | noblest-governor | of  
le | fasygu'e | cu | na | krecau  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | French-country |  | [false] | is-hair-without.  
The current king of France isn't bald.  
---  
  

**Example 15.17. **
ti | na | barda | prenu | co | melbi | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | [false] | is-a-big | person | of-type | (beautiful-to | me).  
This isn't a big person who is beautiful to me.  
---  
  

Although there is this fundamental difference between Lojban's internal bridi negation and English negation, we note that in many cases, especially when there are no existential or quantified variables (the cmavo __da__ , __de__ , and __di__ of selma'o KOhA, explained in Chapter 16) in the bridi, you can indeed translate Lojban __na__ as “not” (or “isn't” or “doesn't”, as appropriate).
The most important rule about bridi negation is that if a bridi is true, its negation is false, and vice versa.
In Lojban, there are several structures that implicitly contain bridi, so that Lojban sentences may contain more than one occurrence of __na__. For example:
**Example 15.18. **
mi | na | gleki | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [false] | am-happy-about | the | event-of  
na | klama | le | nu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---  
([false] | going-to | the | event-of | dancing).  
It is not the case that I am happy about it not being the case that I am going to the dance.  
---  
I am not happy about not going to the dance.  
  

In the previous example, we used internal negations in abstraction bridi; bridi negation may also be found in descriptions within sumti. For example:
**Example 15.19. **
mi | nelci | le | na | melbi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-fond-of | the-one-described-as | ([false] | beautiful).  
I am fond of the one who isn't beautiful.  
---  
  

A more extreme (and more indefinite) example is:
**Example 15.20. **
mi | nelci | lo | na  
---|---|---|---  
I | am-fond-of | one-who-is | ([false]  
ca | nolraitru | be | le | frasygu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
the-current | king | of | the | French-country).  
I am fond of one who isn't the current king of France.  
---  
  

The claim of Example 15.20 could apply to anyone except a person who is fond of no one at all, since the relation within the description is false for everyone. You cannot readily express these situations in colloquial English.
Negation with __na__ applies to an entire bridi, and not to just part of a selbri. Therefore, you won't likely have reason to put __na__ inside a tanru. In fact, the grammar currently does not allow you to do so (except in a lujvo and in elaborate constructs involving GUhA, the forethought connector for selbri). Any situation where you might want to do so can be expressed in a less-compressed non-tanru form. This grammatical restriction helps ensure that bridi negation is kept separate from other forms of negation.
The grammar of __na__ allows multiple adjacent negations, which cancel out, as in normal logic:
**Example 15.21. **
ti | na | na | barda | prenu | co | melbi | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | [false] | [false] | is-a-big | person | that | is-(beautiful-to | me).  
  

which is the same as:
**Example 15.22. **
ti | barda | prenu | co | melbi | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-big | person | that | is-(beautiful-to | me).  
  

When a selbri is tagged with a tense or a modal, negation with __na__ is permitted in two positions: before or after the tag. No semantic difference between these forms has yet been defined, but this is not finally determined, since the interactions between tenses/modals and bridi negation have not been fully explored. In particular, it remains to be seen whether sentences using less familiar tenses, such as:
**Example 15.23. **
mi | [cu] | ta'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | habitually | go-to | the | market.  
  

mean the same thing with __na__ before the __ta'e__ , as when the negation occurs afterwards; we'll let future, Lojban-speaking, logicians decide on how they relate to each other.
A final caution on translating English negations into Lojban: if you translate the English literally, you'll get the wrong one. With English causal statements, and other statements with auxiliary clauses, this problem is more likely.
Thus, if you translate the English:
**Example 15.24. **
I do not go to the market because the car is broken.
  

as:
**Example 15.25. **
mi | na | klama | le | zarci | ki'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [false] | go-to | the | market | because-of  
lenu | le | karce | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---  
the-event-of | the | car |  | is-broken.  
It is false that: I go to the market because the car is broken.  
---  
  

you end up negating too much.
Such mistranslations result from the ambiguity of English compounded by the messiness of natural language negation. A correct translation of the normal interpretation of Example 15.24 is:
**Example 15.26. **
le | nu | mi | na | klama | le | zarci | cu | se | krinu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | (my | [false] | going-to | the | market) |  |  | is-justified-by  
le | nu | le | karce | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | (the | car |  | being-broken).  
My not going to the market is because the car is broken.

In Example 15.26, the negation is clearly confined to the event abstraction in the x1 sumti, and does not extend to the whole sentence. The English could also have been expressed by two separate sentences joined by a causal connective (which we'll not go into here).
The problem is not confined to obvious causals. In the English:
**Example 15.27. **
I was not conscripted into the Army with the help of my uncle the Senator.
  

we do not intend the uncle's help to be part of the negation. We must thus move the negation into an event clause or use two separate sentences. The event-clause version would look like:
**Example 15.28. **
The event-of (my [false] being-conscripted-into the Army) was aided by my uncle the Senator.
  

It is possible that someone will want to incorporate bridi negations into lujvo. For this reason, the rafsi _-nar-_ has been reserved for __na__. However, before using this rafsi, make sure that you intend the contradictory bridi negation, and not the scalar negation described in Section 15.3, which will be much more common in tanru and lujvo.
