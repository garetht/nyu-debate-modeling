## 15.9. Affirmations
There is an explicit positive form for both selma'o NA (__ja'a__) and selma'o NAhE (__je'a__), each of which would supplant the corresponding negator in the grammatical position used, allowing one to assert the positive in response to a negative question or statement without confusion. Assuming the same context as in Section 15.8:
**Example 15.89. **
xu | na | go'i  
---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that | [false] | [repeat-previous]?  
  

or equivalently
**Example 15.90. **
xu | la | djan. | [cu] | na | pu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that: | that-named | John |  | [false] | previously  
klama | la | paris. | .e | la | rom.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
went-to | that-name | Paris | and | that-named | Rome.  
  

The obvious, but incorrect, positive response to this negative question is:
**Example 15.91. **
go'i  
---  
[repeat-previous]  
---  
  

A plain __go'i__ does not mean “Yes it is”; it merely abbreviates repeating the previous statement unmodified, including any negators present; and Example 15.91 actually states that it is false that John went to both Paris and Rome.
When considering:
**Example 15.92. **
na | go'i  
---|---  
[false] | [repeat-previous]  
  

as a response to a negative question like Example 15.90, Lojban designers had to choose between two equally plausible interpretations with opposite effects. Does Example 15.92 create a double negative in the sentence by adding a new __na__ to the one already there (forming a double negative and hence a positive statement), or does the __na__ replace the previous one, leaving the sentence unchanged?
It was decided that substitution, the latter alternative, is the preferable choice, since it is then clear whether we intend a positive or a negative sentence without performing any manipulations. This is the way English usually works, but not all languages work this way – Russian, Japanese, and Navajo all interpret a negative reply to a negative question as positive.
The positive assertion cmavo of selma'o NA, which is "ja'a", can also replace the __na__ in the context, giving:
**Example 15.93. **
ja'a | go'i  
---|---  
[true] | [repeat-previous]  
John did go to Paris and Rome.  
---  
  

__ja'a__ can replace __na__ in a similar manner wherever the latter is used:
**Example 15.94. **
mi | ja'a | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [true] | go-to | the | store  
I indeed go to the store.  
---  
  

__je'a__ can replace __na'e__ in exactly the same way, stating that scalar negation does not apply, and that the relation indeed holds as stated. In the absence of a negation context, it emphasizes the positive:
**Example 15.95. **
ta | je'a | melbi  
---|---|---  
that | is-indeed | beautiful.

## 8.2. Incidental relative clauses
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
noi |  NOI |  incidental relative clause introducer  
---|---|---  
There are two basic kinds of relative clauses: restrictive relative clauses introduced by __poi__ , and incidental (sometimes called simply “non-restrictive”) relative clauses introduced by __noi__. The difference between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide information that is essential to identifying the referent of the sumti to which they are attached, whereas incidental relative clauses provide additional information which is helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying the referent of the sumti. All of the examples in Section 8.1 are restrictive relative clauses: the information in the relative clause is essential to identification. (The title of this chapter, though, uses an incidental relative clause.)
Consider the following examples:
**Example 8.12. **
le | gerku | poi | blanu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which | is-blue |  | is-large.  
The dog which is blue is large.  
---  
  

**Example 8.13. **
le | gerku | noi | blanu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | incidentally-which | is-blue |  | is-large.  
The dog, which is blue, is large.  
---  
  

In Example 8.12, the information conveyed by _poi blanu_ is essential to identifying the dog in question: it restricts the possible referents from dogs in general to dogs that are blue. This is why __poi__ relative clauses are called restrictive. In Example 8.13, on the other hand, the dog which is referred to has presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative clause _noi blanu_ just provides additional information about it. (If in fact the dog hasn't been identified clearly, then the relative clause does not help identify it further.)
In English, the distinction between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is expressed in writing by surrounding incidental, but not restrictive, clauses with commas. These commas are functioning as parentheses, because incidental relative clauses are essentially parenthetical. This distinction in punctuation is represented in speech by a difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive relative clauses can be introduced by “that” as well as “which” and “who”, whereas incidental relative clauses cannot begin with “that”. Lojban, however, always uses the cmavo __poi__ and __noi__ rather than punctuation or intonation to make the distinction.
Here are more examples of incidental relative clauses:
**Example 8.14. **
mi | noi | pajni | cu | zvati  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | who-incidentally | am-a-judge |  | am-at | [some-place].  
I, a judge, am present.  
---  
  

In this example, __mi__ is already sufficiently restricted, and the additional information that I am a judge is being provided solely for the listener's edification.
**Example 8.15. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | karce | noi | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | car | incidentally-which | is-white.  
Do you see my car, which is white?  
---  
  

In Example 8.15, the speaker is presumed to have only one car, and is providing incidental information that it is white. (Alternatively, he or she might have more than one car, since _le karce_ can be plural, in which case the incidental information is that each of them is white.) Contrast Example 8.16 with a restrictive relative clause:
**Example 8.16. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | karce | poi | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | car | which | is-white.  
Do you see my car that is white?  
---  
Do you see my white car?  
  

Here the speaker probably has several cars, and is restricting the referent of the sumti _le mi karce_ (and thereby the listener's attention) to the white one only. Example 8.16 means much the same as Example 8.17, which does not use a relative clause:
**Example 8.17. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | blabi | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | white | car.  
Do you see my car, the white one?  
---  
  

So a restrictive relative clause attached to a description can often mean the same as a description involving a tanru. However, _blabi karce_ , like all tanru, is somewhat vague: in principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things, or even express some more complicated concept involving whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative clause of Example 8.16 can only refer to a car which is white, not to any more complex or extended concept.

## 10.19. Actuality, potentiality, capability: CAhA
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ca'a |  CAhA |  actually is  
---|---|---  
ka'e |  CAhA |  is innately capable of  
nu'o |  CAhA |  can but has not  
pu'i |  CAhA |  can and has  
Lojban bridi without tense markers may not necessarily refer to actual events: they may also refer to capabilities or potential events. For example:
**Example 10.138. **
ro | datka | cu | flulimna  
---|---|---|---  
All | ducks |  | are-float-swimmers.  
All ducks swim by floating.  
---  
  

is a Lojban truth, even though the colloquial English translation is false or at best ambiguous. This is because the tenseless Lojban bridi doesn't necessarily claim that every duck is swimming or floating now or even at a specific time or place. Even if we add a tense marker to Example 10.138,
**Example 10.139. **
ro | datka | ca | flulimna  
---|---|---|---  
All | ducks | [present] | are-float-swimmers.  
All ducks are now swimming by floating.  
---  
  

the resulting Example 10.139 might still be considered a truth, even though the colloquial English seems even more likely to be false. All ducks have the potential of swimming even if they are not exercising that potential at present. To get the full flavor of “All ducks are now swimming”, we must append a marker from selma'o CAhA to the tense, and say:
**Example 10.140. **
ro | datka | ca | ca'a | flulimna  
---|---|---|---|---  
All | ducks | [present] | [actual] | are-float-swimmers.  
All ducks are now actually swimming by floating.  
---  
  

A CAhA cmavo is always placed after any other tense cmavo, whether for time or for space. However, a CAhA cmavo comes before __ki__ , so that a CAhA condition can be made sticky.
Example 10.140 is false in both Lojban and English, since it claims that the swimming is an actual, present fact, true of every duck that exists, whereas in fact there is at least one duck that is not swimming now.
Furthermore, some ducks are dead (and therefore sink); some ducks have just hatched (and do not know how to swim yet), and some ducks have been eaten by predators (and have ceased to exist as separate objects at all). Nevertheless, all these ducks have the innate capability of swimming – it is part of the nature of duckhood. The cmavo __ka'e__ expresses this notion of innate capability:
**Example 10.141. **
ro | datka | ka'e | flulimna  
---|---|---|---  
All | ducks | [capable] | are-float-swimmers.  
All ducks are innately capable of swimming.  
---  
  

Under some epistemologies, innate capability can be extended in order to apply the innate properties of a mass to which certain individuals belong to the individuals themselves, even if those individuals are themselves not capable of fulfilling the claim of the bridi. For example:
**Example 10.142. **
la | djan. | ka'e | viska  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [capable] | sees.  
John is innately capable of seeing.  
---  
John can see.  
  

might be true about a human being named John, even though he has been blind since birth, because the ability to see is innately built into his nature as a human being. It is theoretically possible that conditions might occur that would enable John to see (a great medical discovery, for example). On the other hand,
**Example 10.143. **
le | cukta | ka'e | viska  
---|---|---|---  
The | book | [capable] | sees.  
The book can see.  
---  
  

is not true in most epistemologies, since the ability to see is not part of the innate nature of a book.
Consider once again the newly hatched ducks mentioned earlier. They have the potential of swimming, but have not yet demonstrated that potential. This may be expressed using __nu'o__ , the cmavo of CAhA for undemonstrated potential:
**Example 10.144. **
ro | cifydatka | nu'o | flulimna  
---|---|---|---  
All | infant-ducks | [can-but-has-not] | are-float-swimmers.  
All infant ducks have an undemonstrated potential for swimming by floating.  
---  
Baby ducks can swim but haven't yet.  
  

Contrariwise, if Frank is not blind from birth, then __pu'i__ is appropriate:
**Example 10.145. **
la | frank. | pu'i | viska  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | [can-and-has] | sees.  
Frank has demonstrated a potential for seeing.  
---  
Frank can see and has seen.  
  

Note that the glosses given at the beginning of this section for __ca'a__ , __nu'o__ , and __pu'i__ incorporate __ca__ into their meaning, and are really correct for _ca ca'a_ , _ca nu'o_ , and _ca pu'i_. However, the CAhA cmavo are perfectly meaningful with other tenses than the present:
**Example 10.146. **
mi | pu | ca'a | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [actual] | go-to | the | store.  
I actually went to the store.  
---  
  

**Example 10.147. **
la | frank. | ba | nu'o | klama | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | [future] | [can-but-has-not] | goes-to | the | store.  
Frank could have, but will not have, gone to the store (at some understood moment in the future).  
---  
  

As always in Lojban tenses, a missing CAhA can have an indeterminate meaning, or the context can be enough to disambiguate it. Saying
**Example 10.148. **
ta | jelca  
---|---  
That | burns/is-burning/might-burn/will-burn.  
  

with no CAhA specified can translate the two very different English sentences “That is on fire” and “That is inflammable.” The first demands immediate action (usually), whereas the second merely demands caution. The two cases can be disambiguated with:
**Example 10.149. **
ta | ca | ca'a | jelca  
---|---|---|---  
That | [present] | [actual] | burns.  
That is on fire.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.150. **
ta | ka'e | jelca  
---|---|---  
That | [capable] | burns.  
That is capable of burning.  
---  
That is inflammable.  
  

When no indication is given, as in the simple observative
**Example 10.151. **
jelca  
---  
It burns!  
---  
  

the prudent Lojbanist will assume the meaning “Fire!”

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  
I'm worn out by your continuous talking.  
---  
  

**Example 13.27. **
.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  
I'm putting you to bed.  
---  
  

**Example 13.28. **
.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.  
---  
  

**Example 13.29. **
.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  
I hope I feel better tomorrow!  
---  
  

**Example 13.30. **
.au | mi | sipna  
---|---|---  
[desire] | I | sleep.  
I want to sleep.  
---  
  

**Example 13.31. **
.a'ucu'i | do | pante  
---|---|---  
[no-interest] | you | complain.  
I have no interest in your complaints.  
---  
  

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  
I feel up to dealing with you.  
---  
  

**Example 13.34. **
.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  
I should fill the car's gas tank.  
---  
  

**Example 13.35. **
.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  
---|---|---|---  
[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  
Please take care of yourself!  
---  
  

**Example 13.36. **
.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  
I suggest going to the park.  
---  
  

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  
I can't believe you thought you could fool me.  
---  
  

**Example 13.38. **
do | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  
I blame you for not coming home.  
---  
  

**Example 13.39. **
.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  
le | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  
It's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  
---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  
---

## 14.6. sumti connection
Geks and ijeks are sufficient to state every possible logical connection between two bridi. However, it is often the case that two bridi to be logically connected have one or more portions in common:
**Example 14.25. **
la | djan. | klama | le | zarci | .ije | la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
John goes to the market, and Alice goes to the market.  
---  
  

Here only a single sumti differs between the two bridi. Lojban does not require that both bridi be expressed in full. Instead, a single bridi can be given which contains both of the different sumti and uses a logical connective from a different selma'o to combine the two sumti:
**Example 14.26. **
la | djan | .e | la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | and | that-named | Alice | go-to | the | market.  
  

Example 14.26 means exactly the same thing as Example 14.25: one may be rigorously transformed into the other without any change of logical meaning. This rule is true in general for every different kind of logical connection in Lojban; all of them, with one exception (see Section 14.12), can always be transformed into a logical connection between sentences that expresses the same truth function.
The afterthought logical connectives between sumti are eks, which contain a connective cmavo of selma'o A. If ijeks were used in Example 14.26, the meaning would be changed:
**Example 14.27. **
la | djan. |  | .ije  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [is/does-something]. | And  
la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Alices | goes-to | the | market.  
  

leaving the reader uncertain why John is mentioned at all.
Any ek may be used between sumti, even if there is no direct English equivalent:
**Example 14.28. **
la | djan. | .o | la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | if-and-only-if | that-named | Alice | goes-to | the | market.  
John goes to the market if, and only if, Alice does.  
---  
  

The second line of Example 14.27 is highly stilted English, but the first line (of which it is a literal translation) is excellent Lojban.
What about forethought sumti connection? As is the case for bridi connection, geks are appropriate. They are not the only selma'o of forethought logical-connectives, but are the most commonly used ones.
**Example 14.29. **
ga | la | djan. | gi | la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either John or Alice (or both) goes to the market.  
---  
  

Of course, eks include all the same patterns of compound cmavo that ijeks do. When __na__ or __se__ is part of an ek, a special writing convention is invoked, as in the following example:
**Example 14.30. **
la | djan. | na.a | la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | only-if | that-named | Alice | goes-to | the | market.  
John goes to the market only if Alice does.  
---  
  

Note the period in __na__ __.a__. The cmavo of A begin with vowels, and therefore must always be preceded by a pause. It is conventional to write all connective compounds as single words (with no spaces), but this pause must still be marked in writing as in speech; otherwise, the __na__ and __a__ would tend to run together.

## 10.20. Logical and non-logical connections between tenses
Like many things in Lojban, tenses may be logically connected; logical connection is explained in more detail in Chapter 14. Some of the terminology in this section will be clear only if you already understand logical connectives.
The appropriate logical connectives belong to selma'o JA. A logical connective between tenses can always be expanded to one between sentences:
**Example 10.152. **
mi | pu | je | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | and | [future] | go-to | the | market.  
I went and will go to the market.  
---  
  

means the same as:
**Example 10.153. **
mi | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | go-to | the | market.  
.ije | mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
And | I | [future] | go-to | the | market.  
I went to the market, and I will go to the market.  
---  
  

Tense connection and tense negation are combined in:
**Example 10.154. **
mi | punai | je | canai | je | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past-not] | and | [present-not] | and | [future] | go-to | the | market.  
I haven't yet gone to the market, but I will in future.  
---  
  

Example 10.154 is far more specific than
**Example 10.155. **
mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | go-to | the | market.  
  

which only says that I will go, without claiming anything about my past or present. __ba__ does not imply _punai_ or _canai_ ; to compel that interpretation, either a logical connection or a ZAhO is needed.
Tense negation can often be removed in favor of negation in the logical connective itself. The following examples are equivalent in meaning:
**Example 10.156. **
mi | mo'izu'anai | je | mo'iri'u | cadzu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [motion-left-not] | and | [motion-right] | walk.  
I walk not leftward but rightward.  
---  
  

**Example 10.157. **
mi | mo'izu'a | naje | mo'iri'u | cadzu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [motion-left] | not-and | [motion-right] | walk.  
I walk not leftward but rightward.  
---  
  

There are no forethought logical connections between tenses allowed by the grammar, to keep tenses simpler. Nor is there any way to override simple left-grouping of the connectives, the Lojban default.
The non-logical connectives of selma'o JOI, BIhI, and GAhO are also permitted between tenses. One application is to specify intervals not by size, but by their end-points (__bi'o__ belongs to selma'o BIhI, and connects the end-points of an ordered interval, like English “from ... to”):
**Example 10.158. **
mi | puza | bi'o | bazu | vasxu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past-medium] | from…to | [future-long] | breathe.  
I breathe from a medium time ago till a long time to come.  
---  
  

(It is to be hoped that I have a long life ahead of me.)
One additional use of non-logical connectives within tenses is discussed in Section 10.21. Other uses will probably be identified in future.
