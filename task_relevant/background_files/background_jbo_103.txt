## 13.16. Tentative conclusion
The exact ramifications of the indicator system in actual usage are unknown. There has never been anything like it in natural language before. The system provides great potential for emotional expression and transcription, from which significant Sapir-Whorf effects can be anticipated. When communicating across cultural boundaries, where different indicators are often used for the same emotion, accidental offense can be avoided. If we ever ran into an alien race, a culturally neutral language of emotion could be vital. (A classic example, taken from the science fiction of Larry Niven, is to imagine speaking Lojban to the carnivorous warriors called Kzinti, noting that a human smile bares the teeth, and could be seen as an intent to attack.) And for communicating emotions to computers, when we cannot identify all of the signals involved in subliminal human communication (things like body language are also cultural), a system like this is needed.
We have tried to err on the side of overkill. There are distinctions possible in this system that no one may care to make in any culture. But it was deemed more neutral to overspecify and let usage decide, than to choose a limited set and constrain emotional expression. For circumstances in which even the current indicator set is not enough, it is possible using the cmavo __sei__ , explained in Section 19.12, to create metalinguistic comments that act like indicators.
We envision an evolutionary development. At this point, the system is little more than a mental toy. Many of you who read this will try playing around with various combinations of indicators, trying to figure out what emotions they express and when the expressions might be useful. You may even find an expression for which there currently is no good English word and start using it. Why not, if it helps you express your feelings?
There will be a couple dozen of these used pretty much universally – mostly just simple attitudinals with, at most, intensity markers. These are the ones that will quickly be expressed at the subconscious level. But every Lojbanist who plays with the list will bring in a couple of new words. Poets will paint emotional pictures, and people who identify with those pictures will use the words so created for their own experiences.
Just as a library of tanru is built up, so will a library of attitudes be built. Unlike the tanru, though, the emotional expressions are built on some fairly nebulous root emotions – words that cannot be defined with the precision of the gismu. The emotion words of Lojban will very quickly take on a life of their own, and the outline given here will evolve into a true system of emotions.
There are several theories as to the nature of emotion, and they change from year to year as we learn more about ourselves. Whether or not Lojban's additive/scalar emotional model is an accurate model for human emotions, it does support the linguistic needs for expressing those emotions. Researchers may learn more about the nature of human emotions by exploring the use of the system by Lojban speakers. They also may be able to use the Lojban system as a means for more clearly recording emotions.
The full list of scales and attitudes will probably not be used until someone speaks the language from birth. Until then, people will use the attitudes that are important to them. In this way, we counter cultural bias – if a culture is prone to recognizing and/or expressing certain emotions more than others, its members will use only those out of the enormous set available. If a culture hides certain emotions, its members simply won't express them.
Perhaps native Lojban speakers will be more expressively clear about their emotions than others. Perhaps they will feel some emotions more strongly than others in ways that can be correlated with the word choices; any difference from the norms of other cultures could be significant. Psychologists have devised elaborate tests for measuring attitudes and personality; this may be the easiest area in which to detect any systematic cultural effect of the type sought to confirm Sapir-Whorf, simply because we already have tools in existence to test it. Because Lojban is unique among languages in having such extensive and expressive indicators, it is likely that a Sapir-Whorf effect will occur and will be recognized.
It is unlikely that we will know the true potential of a system like this one until and unless we have children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking environment. We learn too many cultural habits in the realm of emotional communication “at our mother's knee”. Such children will have a Lojban system that has stronger reinforcement than any typical culture system. The second generation of such children, then, could be said to be the start of a true Lojbanic culture.
We shouldn't need to wait that long to detect significant effects. Emotion is so basic to our lives that even a small change or improvement in emotional communication would have immediately noticeable effects. Perhaps it will be the case that the most important contribution of our “logical language” will be in the non-logical realm of emotion!

## 7.15. lujvo based on pro-sumti
There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See Section 7.16 for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.
Thus __donta'a__ , meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted as _tavla be do_ , and would have the place structure
**Example 7.76. **
> t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
  

since `t2` (the addressee) is already known to be __do__.
On the other hand, the lujvo __donma'o__ , literally “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal pronoun”, would be interpreted as _cmavo be zo do_ , and have the place structure:
**Example 7.77. **
> c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
  

since both the `c2` place (the grammatical class) and the `c3` place (the meaning) are obvious from the context __do__.
An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the __fo'a__ series is to express lujvo which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An example would be:
**Example 7.78. **
fo'a | goi | le | kulnrsu,omi | .i | lo | fo'arselsanga  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x6 | stands-for | the | Finnish-culture | . | An | x6-song.  
  

Finally, lujvo involving __zi'o__ are also possible, and are fully discussed in Chapter 12. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for __zi'o__ as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a _se pinxe be zi'o_ , the lujvo corresponding to this is _zilrelselpinxe_ (deleting the second place of _se pinxe_). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that _zilpavypinxe_ has the same place structure as _zilrelselpinxe_ , and _lo zilpavypinxe_ , like _lo zilrelselpinxe_ , refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ , __du__ , and __bu'a__ also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for _du-_ based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.

## 18.17. Logical and non-logical connectives within mekso
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
.abu |  BY |  letter “a”  
---|---|---  
by |  BY |  letter “b”  
cy |  BY |  letter “c”  
fe'a |  VUhU |  nth root of (default square root)  
lo'o |  LOhO |  terminator for LI  
As befits a logical language, Lojban has extensive provision for logical connectives within both operators and operands. Full details on logical and non-logical connectives are provided in Chapter 14. Operands are connected in afterthought with selma'o A and in forethought with selma'o GA, just like sumti. Operators are connected in afterthought with selma'o JA and in forethought with selma'o GUhA, just like tanru components. This parallelism is no accident.
In addition, A+BO and A+KE constructs are allowed for grouping logically connected operands, and __ke__ … __ke'e__ is allowed for grouping logically connected operators, although there are no analogues of tanru among the operators.
Despite the large number of rules required to support this feature, it is of relatively minor importance in the mekso scheme of things. Example 18.114 exhibits afterthought logical connection between operands:
**Example 18.114. **
vei | ci | .a | vo | ve'o | prenu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | Three | or | four | ) | people |  | go | to-the | market.  
  

Example 18.115 is equivalent in meaning, but uses forethought connection:
**Example 18.115. **
vei | ga | ci | gi | vo | ve'o | prenu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | Either | 3 | or | 4 | ) | people |  | go | to-the | market.  
  

Note that the mekso here are being used as quantifiers. Lojban requires that any mekso other than a simple number be enclosed in parentheses when used as a quantifier. This rule prevents ambiguities that do not exist when using __li__.
By the way, __li__ has an elidable terminator, __lo'o__ , which is needed when a __li__ sumti is followed by a logical connective that could seem to be within the mekso. For example:
**Example 18.116. **
li | re | su'i | re | du  
---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | two | plus | two | equals  
li | vo | lo'o | .onai | lo | nalseldjuno | namcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | four |  | or-else | a | non-known | number.  
  

Omitting the __lo'o__ would cause the parser to assume that another operand followed the __.onai__ and reject __lo__ as an invalid operand.
Simple examples of logical connection between operators are hard to come by. A contrived example is:
**Example 18.117. **
li | re | su'i | je | pi'i | re | du | li | vo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | two | plus | and | times | two | equals | the-number | four.  
2 + 2 = 4 and 2 × 2 = 4.  
  

The forethought-connection form of Example 18.117 is:
**Example 18.118. **
li | re | ge | su'i | gi | pi'i | re | du | li | vo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | two | both | plus | and | times | two | equals | the-number | four.  
Both 2 + 2 = 4 and 2 × 2 = 4.  
  

Here is a classic example of operand logical connection:
**Example 18.119. **
go | li | .abu | bi'epi'i | vei | xy. | te'a | re | ve'o | su'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
If-and-only-if | the-number |  “a” | times | ( |  “x” | power | two | ) | plus  
by. | bi'epi'i | xy. | su'i | cy. | du | li | no  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
“b” | times |  “x” | plus |  “c” | equals | the-number | zero  
gi | li | xy. | du | li | vei | va'a | by. | ku'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | the-number | x | equals | the-number | [ | the-negation-of( | b | )  
su'i | ja | vu'u | fe'a  
---|---|---|---  
plus | or | minus | the-root-of  
vei | by. | bi'ete'a | re | vu'u | vo | bi'epi'i | .abu | bi'epi'i | cy.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( |  “b” | power | 2 | minus | four | times |  “a” | times |  “c”  
ve'o | [ku'e] | ve'o | fe'i | re | bi'epi'i | .abu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
) |  | ] | divided-by | two | times |  “a”  
Iff  a x 2 + b x + c = 0 , then  x = - b ± b 2 - 4 a c 2 a  
  

Note the mixture of styles in Example 18.119: the negation of b and the square root are represented by forethought and most of the operator precedence by prefixed __bi'e__ , but explicit parentheses had to be added to group the numerator properly. In addition, the square root parentheses cannot be removed here in favor of simple __fe'a__ and __ku'e__ bracketing, because infix operators are present in the operand. Getting Example 18.119 to parse perfectly using the current parser took several tries: a more relaxed style would dispense with most of the __bi'e__ cmavo and just let the standard precedence rules be understood.
Non-logical connection with JOI and BIhI is also permitted between operands and between operators. One use for this construct is to connect operands with __bi'o__ to create intervals:
**Example 18.120. **
li | no | ga'o | bi'o | ke'i | pa  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | zero | (inclusive) | from-to | (exclusive) | one  
[0,1)  
the numbers from zero to one, including zero but not including one  
---  
  

Intervals defined by a midpoint and range rather than beginning and end points can be expressed by __mi'i__ :
**Example 18.121. **
li | pimu | ga'o | mi'i | ke'i | pimu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 0.5 | (inclusive) | centered-with-range | (exclusive) | 0.5  
  

which expresses the same interval as Example 18.120. Note that the __ga'o__ and __ke'i__ still refer to the endpoints, although these are now implied rather than expressed. Another way of expressing the same thing:
**Example 18.122. **
li | pimu | su'i | ni'upimu | bi'o | ke'i | ma'upimu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 0.5 | plus | [-0.5 | from-to | (exclusive) | +0.5]  
  

Here we have the sum of a number and an interval, which produces another interval centered on the number. As Example 18.122 shows, non-logical (or logical) connection of operands has higher precedence than any mekso operator.
You can also combine two operands with __ce'o__ , the sequence connective of selma'o JOI, to make a compound subscript:
**Example 18.123. **
xy. | xi | vei | by. | ce'o | dy. | [ve'o]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
“x” | sub | ( |  “b” | sequence |  “d” | )  
xb,d

## 18.5. Simple infix expressions and equations
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
du |  GOhA |  equals  
---|---|---  
su'i |  VUhU |  plus  
vu'u |  VUhU |  minus  
pi'i |  VUhU |  times  
te'a |  VUhU |  raised to the power  
ny. |  BY |  letter “n”  
vei |  VEI |  left parenthesis  
ve'o |  VEhO |  right parenthesis  
Let us begin at the beginning: one plus one equals two. In Lojban, that sentence translates to:
**Example 18.22. **
li | pa | su'i | pa | du | li | re  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | one | plus | one | equals | the-number | two.  
1 + 1 = 2  
  

Example 18.22, a mekso sentence, is a regular Lojban bridi that exploits mekso features. __du__ is the predicate meaning “x1 is mathematically equal to x2”. It is a cmavo for conciseness, but it has the same grammatical uses as any brivla. Outside mathematical contexts, __du__ means “x1 is identical with x2” or “x1 is the same object as x2”.
The cmavo __li__ is the number article. It is required whenever a sentence talks about numbers as numbers, as opposed to using numbers to quantify things. For example:
**Example 18.23. **
le | ci | prenu  
---|---|---  
the three persons  
---  
  

requires no __li__ article, because the __ci__ is being used to specify the number of __prenu__. However, the sentence
**Example 18.24. **
levi | sfani | cu | grake | li | ci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | fly |  | masses-in-grams | the-number | three.  
This fly has a mass of 3 grams.  
---  
  

requires __li__ because __ci__ is being used as a sumti. Note that this is the way in which measurements are stated in Lojban: all the predicates for units of length, mass, temperature, and so on have the measured object as the first place and a number as the second place. Using __li__ for __le__ in Example 18.23 would produce
**Example 18.25. **
li | ci | prenu  
---|---|---  
The-number | 3 | is-a-person.  
  

which is grammatical but nonsensical: numbers are not persons.
The cmavo __su'i__ belongs to selma'o VUhU, which is composed of mathematical operators, and means “addition”. As mentioned before, it is distinct from __ma'u__ which means the positive sign as an indication of a positive number:
**Example 18.26. **
li | ma'u | pa | su'i  
---|---|---|---  
The-number | positive-sign | one | plus  
ni'u | pa | du | li | no  
---|---|---|---|---  
negative-sign | one | equals | the-number | zero.  
+1 + -1 = 0  
  

Of course, it is legal to have complex mekso on both sides of __du__ :
**Example 18.27. **
li | mu | su'i | pa | du | li | ci | su'i | ci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | five | plus | one | equals | the-number | three | plus | three.  
5 + 1 = 3 + 3  
  

Why don't we say _li mu su'i li pa_ rather than just _li mu su'i pa_? The answer is that VUhU operators connect mekso operands (numbers, in Example 18.27), not general sumti. __li__ is used to make the entire mekso into a sumti, which then plays the roles applicable to other sumti: in Example 18.27, filling the places of a bridi
By default, Lojban mathematics is like simple calculator mathematics: there is no notion of “operator precedence”. Consider the following example, where __pi'i__ means “times”, the multiplication operator:
**Example 18.28. **
li | ci | su'i | vo | pi'i | mu | du | li | reci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | three | plus | four | times | five | equals | the-number | two-three.  
3 + 4 × 5 = 23  
  

Is the Lojban version of Example 18.28 true? No! “3 + 4 × 5” is indeed 23, because the usual conventions of mathematics state that multiplication takes precedence over addition; that is, the multiplication “4 × 5” is done first, giving 20, and only then the addition “3 + 20”. But VUhU operators by default are done left to right, like other Lojban grouping, and so a truthful bridi would be:
**Example 18.29. **
li | ci | su'i | vo | pi'i | mu | du | li | cimu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | three | plus | four | times | five | equals | the-number | three-five.  
3 + 4 × 5 = 35  
  

Here we calculate 3 + 4 first, giving 7, and then calculate 7 × 5 second, leading to the result 35. While possessing the advantage of simplicity, this result violates the design goal of matching the standards of mathematics. What can be done?
There are three solutions, all of which will probably be used to some degree. The first solution is to ignore the problem. People will say _li ci su'i vo pi'i mu_ and mean 23 by it, because the notion that multiplication takes precedence over addition is too deeply ingrained to be eradicated by Lojban parsing, which totally ignores semantics. This convention essentially allows semantics to dominate syntax in this one area.
(Why not hard-wire the precedences into the grammar, as is done in computer programming languages? Essentially because there are too many operators, known and unknown, with levels of precedence that vary according to usage. The programming language 'C' has 13 levels of precedence, and its list of operators is not even extensible. For Lojban this approach is just not practical. In addition, hard-wired precedence could not be overridden in mathematical systems such as spreadsheets where the conventions are different.)
The second solution is to use explicit means to specify the precedence of operators. This approach is fully general, but clumsy, and will be explained in Section 18.20.
The third solution is simple but not very general. When an operator is prefixed with the cmavo __bi'e__ (of selma'o BIhE), it becomes automatically of higher precedence than other operators not so prefixed. Thus,
**Example 18.30. **
li | ci | su'i | vo | bi'e | pi'i | mu | du | li | reci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | three | plus | four | times | five | equals | the-number | two-three.  
3 + 4 × 5 = 23  
  

is a truthful Lojban bridi. If more than one operator has a __bi'e__ prefix, grouping is from the right; multiple __bi'e__ prefixes on a single operator are not allowed.
In addition, of course, Lojban has the mathematical parentheses __vei__ and __ve'o__ , which can be used just like their written equivalents “(” and “)” to group expressions in any way desired:
**Example 18.31. **
li | vei | ny. | su'i | pa | ve'o | pi'i | vei | ny. | su'i | pa | [ve'o]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | ( |  `n` | plus | one | ) | times | ( |  `n` | plus | one | )  
du | li | ny. | [bi'e] | te'a | re  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
equals | the-number | n |  | to-the-power | two  
su'i | re | bi'e | pi'i | ny. | su'i | pa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
plus | two |  | times |  `n` | plus | 1.  
(n+1)(n+1) = n2 \+ 2n + 1  
  

There are several new usages in Example 18.31: __te'a__ means “raised to the power”, and we also see the use of the lerfu word __ny__ , representing the letter “n”. In mekso, letters stand for just what they do in ordinary mathematics: variables. The parser will accept a string of lerfu words (called a “lerfu string”) as the equivalent of a single lerfu word, in agreement with computer-science conventions; “abc” is a single variable, not the equivalent of “a × b × c”. (Of course, a local convention could state that the value of a variable like “abc”, with a multi-lerfu name, was equal to the values of the variables “a”, “b”, and “c” multiplied together.)
The explicit operator __pi'i__ is required in the Lojban verbal form whereas multiplication is implicit in the symbolic form. Note that __ve'o__ (the right parenthesis) is an elidable terminator: the first use of it in Example 18.31 is required, but the second use (marked by square brackets) could be elided. Additionally, the first __bi'e__ (also marked by square brackets) is not necessary to get the proper grouping, but it is included here for symmetry with the other one.

ni'i |  BAI |  nibli modal: logical entailment  
This section has two purposes. On the one hand, it explains the grammatical construct called “modal sentence connection”. On the other, it exemplifies some of the more useful BAI cmavo: the causals. (There are other BAI cmavo which have causal implications: __ja'e__ means “with result”, and so __seja'e__ means “with cause of unspecified nature”; likewise, __gau__ means “with agent” and __tezu'e__ means “with purpose”. These other modal cmavo will not be further discussed here, as my purpose is to explain modal sentence connection rather than Lojbanic views of causation.)
There are four causal gismu in Lojban, distinguishing different versions of the relationships lumped in English as “causal”:
_ _rinka_ _ |  event x1 physically causes event x2  
---|---  
_ _krinu_ _ |  event x1 is the justification for event x2  
_ _mukti_ _ |  event x1 is the (human) motive for event x2  
_ _nibli_ _ |  event x1 logically entails event x2  
Each of these gismu has a related modal: __ri'a__ , __ki'u__ , __mu'i__ , and __ni'i__ respectively. Using these gismu and these modals, we can create various causal sentences with different implications:
**Example 9.35. **
le | spati | cu | banro | ri'a | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | plant |  | grows | with-physical-cause | the | event-of  
do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
you | water | give | to | the | plant.  
The plant grows because you water it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.36. **
la | djan. | cpacu | le | pamoi | se jinga  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John | gets | the | first | prize  
ki'u | le | nu | la | djan. | jinga  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
with-justification | the | event-of | that-named | John | wins.  
John got the first prize because he won.  
---  
  

**Example 9.37. **
mi | lebna | le | cukta | mu'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | took | the | book | with-motivation  
le | nu | mi | viska | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | I | saw | the | book.  
I took the book because I saw it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.38. **
la | sokrates. | morsi | binxo | ni'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
| Socrates | dead | became | with-logical-justification  
le | nu | la | sokrates. | remna  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | that-named | Socrates | is-human.  
Socrates died because Socrates is human.  
---  
  

In Example 9.35 through Example 9.38, the same English word “because” is used to translate all four modals, but the types of cause being expressed are quite different. Let us now focus on Example 9.35, and explore some variations on it.
As written, Example 9.35 claims that the plant grows, but only refers to the event of watering it in an abstraction bridi (abstractions are explained in Chapter 11) without actually making a claim. If I express Example 9.35, I have said that the plant in fact grows, but I have not said that you actually water it, merely that there is a causal relationship between watering and growing. This is semantically asymmetrical. Suppose I wanted to claim that the plant was being watered, and only mention its growth as ancillary information? Then we could reverse the main bridi and the abstraction bridi, saying:
**Example 9.39. **
do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | water | give | to | the | plant  
seri'a | le | nu | ri | banro  
---|---|---|---|---  
with-physical-effect | the | event-of | it | grows.  
You water the plant; therefore, it grows.  
---  
  

with the __ri'a__ changed to __seri'a__. In addition, there are also symmetrical forms:
**Example 9.40. **
le | nu | do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati | cu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | (you | water | give | to | the | plant) |   
rinka | le | nu | le | spati | cu | banro  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
causes | the | event-of | (the | plant |  | grows).  
Your watering the plant causes its growth.  
---  
If you water the plant, then it grows.  
  

does not claim either event, but asserts only the causal relationship between them. So in Example 9.40, I am not saying that the plant grows nor that you have in fact watered it. The second colloquial translation shows a form of “if-then” in English quite distinct from the logical connective “if-then” explained in Chapter 14.
Suppose we wish to claim both events as well as their causal relationship? We can use one of two methods:
**Example 9.41. **
le | spati | cu | banro | .iri'abo | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | plant |  | grows. | Because | you  
djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---  
water | give | to | the | plant.  
The plant grows because you water it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.42. **
do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | water | give | to | the | plant.  
.iseri'abo | le | spati | cu | banro  
---|---|---|---|---  
Therefore | the | plant |  | grows.  
You water the plant; therefore, it grows.  
---  
  

The compound cmavo _.iri'abo_ and _.iseri'abo_ serve to connect two bridi, as the initial __i__ indicates. The final __bo__ is necessary to prevent the modal from “taking over” the following sumti. If the __bo__ were omitted from Example 9.41 we would have:
**Example 9.43. **
le | spati | cu | banro | .i | ri'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | plant |  | grows. |  | Because-of | you,  
| djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[something] | water | gives | to | the | plant.  
The plant grows. Because of you, water is given to the plant.  
---  
  

Because _ri'a do_ is a modal sumti in Example 9.43, there is no longer an explicit sumti in the x1 place of _djacu dunda_ , and the translation must be changed.
The effect of sentences like Example 9.41 and Example 9.42 is that the modal, __ri'a__ in this example, no longer modifies an explicit sumti. Instead, the sumti is implicit, the event given by a full bridi. Furthermore, there is a second implication: that the first bridi fills the x2 place of the gismu __rinka__ ; it specifies an event which is the effect. I am therefore claiming three things: that the plant grows, that you have watered it, and that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the two.
In principle, any modal tag can appear in a sentence connective of the type exemplified by Example 9.41 and Example 9.42. However, it makes little sense to use any modals which do not expect events or other abstractions to fill the places of the corresponding gismu. The sentence connective _.ibaubo_ is perfectly grammatical, but it is hard to imagine any two sentences which could be connected by an “in-language” modal. This is because a sentence describes an event, and an event can be a cause or an effect, but not a language.

## 9.8. Other modal connections
Like many Lojban grammatical constructions, sentence modal connection has both forethought and afterthought forms. (See Chapter 14 for a more detailed discussion of Lojban connectives.) Section 9.7 exemplifies only afterthought modal connection, illustrated here by:
**Example 9.44. **
mi | jgari | lei | djacu  
---|---|---|---  
I | grasp | the-mass-of | water  
.iri'abo | mi | jgari | le | kabri  
---|---|---|---|---  
with-physical-cause | I | grasp | the | cup.  
Causing the mass of water to be grasped by me, I grasped the cup.  
---  
I grasp the water because I grasp the cup.  
  

An afterthought connection is one that is signaled only by a cmavo (or a compound cmavo, in this case) between the two constructs being connected. Forethought connection uses a signal both before the first construct and between the two: the use of “both” and “and” in the first half of this sentence represents a forethought connection (though not a modal one).
To make forethought modal sentence connections in Lojban, place the modal plus __gi__ before the first bridi, and __gi__ between the two. No __i__ is used within the construct. The forethought equivalent of Example 9.44 is:
**Example 9.45. **
ri'agi | mi | jgari | le | kabri | gi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
With-physical-cause | I | grasp | the | cup | ,  
mi | jgari | lei | djacu  
---|---|---|---  
I | grasp | the-mass-of | water.  
Because I grasp the cup, I grasp the water.  
---  
  

Note that the cause, the x1 of __rinka__ is now placed first. To keep the two bridi in the original order of Example 9.44, we could say:
**Example 9.46. **
seri'agi | mi | jgari | lei | djacu | gi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
With-physical-effect | I | grasp | the-mass-of | water | ,  
mi | jgari | le | kabri  
---|---|---|---  
I | grasp | the | cup.  
  

In English, the sentence “Therefore I grasp the water, I grasp the cup” is ungrammatical, because “therefore” is not grammatically equivalent to “because”. In Lojban, _seri'agi_ can be used just like _ri'agi_.
When the two bridi joined by a modal connection have one or more elements (selbri or sumti or both) in common, there are various condensed forms that can be used in place of full modal sentence connection with both bridi completely stated.
When the bridi are the same except for a single sumti, as in Example 9.44 through Example 9.46, then a sumti modal connection may be employed:
**Example 9.47. **
mi | jgari | ri'agi | le | kabri | gi | lei | djacu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | grasp | because | the | cup | , | the-mass-of | water.  
  

Example 9.47 means exactly the same as Example 9.44 through Example 9.46, but there is no idiomatic English translation that will distinguish it from them.
If the two connected bridi are different in more than one sumti, then a termset may be employed. Termsets are explained more fully in Section 14.11, but are essentially a mechanism for creating connections between multiple sumti simultaneously.
**Example 9.48. **
mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | gave | the | book | to-that-named | John.  
.imu'ibo | la | djan. | dunda | lei | jdini | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Motivated-by | that-named | John | gave | the-mass-of | money | to-me.  
I gave the book to John, because John gave money to me.  
---  
  

means the same as:
**Example 9.49. **
nu'i | mu'igi | la | djan. | lei | jdini | mi | gi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[start] | because | that-named | John, | the-mass-of | money, | me | ;  
mi | le | cukta | la | djan. | nu'u | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I, | the | book, | that-named | John | [end] | gives.  
  

Here there are three sumti in each half of the termset, because the two bridi share only their selbri.
There is no modal connection between selbri as such: bridi which differ only in the selbri can be modally connected using bridi-tail modal connection. The bridi-tail construct is more fully explained in Section 14.9, but essentially it consists of a selbri with optional sumti following it. Example 9.37 is suitable for bridi-tail connection, and could be shortened to:
**Example 9.50. **
mi | mu'igi | viska | le | cukta | gi | lebna | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I, | because | saw | the | book, |  | took | the | book.  
  

Again, no straightforward English translation exists. It is even possible to shorten Example 9.50 further to:
**Example 9.51. **
mi | mu'igi | viska | gi | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | because | saw, | therefore | took, |  | the | book.  
  

where _le cukta_ is set off by the non-elidable __vau__ and is made to belong to both bridi-tails – see Section 14.9 for more explanations.
Since this is a chapter on rearranging sumti, it is worth pointing out that Example 9.51 can be further rearranged to:
**Example 9.52. **
mi | le | cukta | mu'igi | viska | gi | lebna  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I, | the | book, | because | saw, | therefore | took.  
  

which doesn't require the extra __vau__ ; all sumti before a conjunction of bridi-tails are shared.
Finally, mathematical operands can be modally connected.
**Example 9.53. **
li | ny. | du | li | vo  
---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | n | = | the-number | 4.  
.ini'ibo | li | ny. | du | li | re | su'i | re  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Entailed-by | the-number | n | = | the-number | 2 | + | 2.  
n = 4 because n = 2 + 2.  
---  
  

can be reduced to:
**Example 9.54. **
li | ny. | du | li  
---|---|---|---  
the-number | n | = | the-number  
ni'igi | vei | re | su'i | re | [ve'o] | gi | vo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
because | ( | 2 | + | 2 | ) | therefore | 4.  
n is 2 + 2, and is thus 4.  
---  
  

The cmavo __vei__ and __ve'o__ represent mathematical parentheses, and are required so that _ni'igi_ affects more than just the immediately following operand, namely the first __re__. (The right parenthesis, __ve'o__ , is an elidable terminator.) As usual, no English translation does Example 9.54 justice.
Note: Due to restrictions on the Lojban parsing algorithm, it is not possible to form modal connectives using the _fi'o-_ plus-selbri form of modal. Only the predefined modals of selma'o BAI can be compounded as shown in Section 9.7 and Section 9.8.

## 6.5. Descriptors for typical objects
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
lo'e |  LE |  the typical  
---|---|---  
le'e |  LE |  the stereotypical  
As promised in Section 6.3, Lojban has a method for discriminating between “the lion” who lives in Africa and “the Englishman” who, generally speaking, doesn't live in Africa even though some Englishmen do. The descriptor __lo'e__ means “the typical”, as in
**Example 6.26. **
lo'e | cinfo | cu | xabju | le | fi'ortu'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-typical | lion |  | dwells-in | the | African-land.  
The lion dwells in Africa.  
---  
  

What is this “typical lion”? Surely it is not any particular lion, because no lion has all of the “typical” characteristics, and (worse yet) some characteristics that all real lions have can't be viewed as typical. For example, all real lions are either male or female, but it would be bizarre to suppose that the typical lion is either one. So the typical lion has no particular sex, but does have a color (golden brown), a residence (Africa), a diet (game), and so on. Likewise we can say that
**Example 6.27. **
lo'e | glipre | cu | xabju  
---|---|---|---  
The-typical | English-person |  | dwells-in  
le | fi'ortu'a | na.e | le | gligugde  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | African-land | (Not!) and | the | English-country.  
The typical English person dwells not in Africa but in England.  
---  
  

The relationship between _lo'e cinfo_ and _lo'i cinfo_ may be explained thus: the typical lion is an imaginary lion-abstraction which best exemplifies the set of lions. There is a similar relationship between __le'e__ and __le'i__ :
**Example 6.28. **
le'e | xelso | merko | cu | gusta | ponse  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-stereotypical | Greek-type-of | American |  | is-a-restaurant-type-of | owner.  
Lots of Greek-Americans own restaurants.  
---  
  

Here we are concerned not with the actual set of Greek-Americans, but with the set of those the speaker has in mind, which is typified by one (real or imaginary) who owns a restaurant. The word “stereotypical” is often derogatory in English, but __le'e__ need not be derogatory in Lojban: it simply suggests that the example is typical in the speaker's imagination rather than in some objectively agreed-upon way. Of course, different speakers may disagree about what the features of “the typical lion” are (some would include having a short intestine, whereas others would know nothing of lions' intestines), so the distinction between _lo'e cinfo_ and _le'e cinfo_ may be very fine.
Furthermore,
**Example 6.29. **
le'e | skina | cu | se finti | ne'i | la | xali,uyd.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-stereotypical | movie |  | is-invented | in | that-named | Hollywood.  
  

is probably true to an American, but might be false (not the stereotype) to someone living in India or Russia.
Note that there is no naming equivalent of __lo'e__ and __le'e__ , because there is no need, as a rule, for a “typical George” or a “typical Smith”. People or things who share a common name do not, in general, have any other common attributes worth mentioning.

## 18.18. Using Lojban resources within mekso
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
na'u |  NAhU |  selbri to operator  
---|---|---  
ni'e |  NIhE |  selbri to operand  
mo'e |  MOhE |  sumti to operand  
te'u |  TEhU |  terminator for all three  
One of the mekso design goals requires the ability to make use of Lojban's vocabulary resources within mekso to extend the built-in cmavo for operands and operators. There are three relevant constructs: all three share the elidable terminator __te'u__ (which is also used to terminate vectors marked with __jo'i__)
The cmavo __na'u__ makes a selbri into an operator. In general, the first place of the selbri specifies the result of the operator, and the other unfilled places specify the operands:
**Example 18.124. **
li | na'u | tanjo | te'u  
---|---|---|---  
The-number | the-operator | tangent | [end-operator]  
vei | pai | fe'i | re | [ve'o] | du | li | ci'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | π | / | 2 | ) | = | the-number | infinity.  
tan(π/2) = ∞  
  

__tanjo__ is the gismu for “x1 is the tangent of x2”, and the __na'u__ here makes it into an operator which is then used in forethought
The cmavo __ni'e__ makes a selbri into an operand. The x1 place of the selbri generally represents a number, and therefore is often a __ni__ abstraction, since __ni__ abstractions represent numbers. The __ni'e__ makes that number available as a mekso operand. A common application is to make equations relating pure dimensions:
**Example 18.125. **
li | ni'e | ni | clani | [te'u]  
---|---|---|---|---  
The-number |  | quantity-of | length |   
pi'i | ni'e | ni | ganra | [te'u]  
---|---|---|---|---  
times |  | quantity-of | width |   
pi'i | ni'e | ni | condi | te'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
times |  | quantity-of | depth |   
du | li | ni'e | ni | canlu  
---|---|---|---|---  
equals | the-number |  | quantity-of | volume.  
Length × Width × Depth = Volume  
  

The cmavo __mo'e__ operates similarly to __ni'e__ , but makes a sumti (rather than a selbri) into an operand. This construction is useful in stating equations involving dimensioned numbers:
**Example 18.126. **
li | mo'e | re | ratcu | su'i | mo'e | re | ractu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number |  | two | rats | plus |  | two | rabbits  
du | li | mo'e | vo | danlu  
---|---|---|---|---  
equals | the-number |  | four | animals.  
2 rats + 2 rabbits = 4 animals.  
  

Another use is in constructing Lojbanic versions of so-called “folk quantifiers”, such as “a pride of lions”:
**Example 18.127. **
mi | viska | vei | mo'e | lo'e | lanzu | ve'o | cinfo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | ( |  | the-typical | family | )-number-of | lions.  
I see a pride of lions.  
---

## 14.7. More than two propositions
So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.
Of the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,
**Example 14.31. **
mi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,
**Example 14.32. **
mi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that one or more of the component sentences is true.
O, however, is different. Working out the truth table for
**Example 14.33. **
mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  
  

shows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:
> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.
Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.
In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.
There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: 
**Example 14.34. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  
.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

Does this mean:
**Example 14.35. **
I like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.
  

Or is the correct translation:
**Example 14.36. **
Either I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.
  

Example 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:
**Example 14.37. **
ga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | I | like | that-named | Martha)  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas
**Example 14.38. **
ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary).  
  

is not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.

## 14.8. Grouping of afterthought connectives
There are several ways in Lojban to render Example 14.35 using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo __bo__ (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with __bo__ are interpreted before connections not so marked. Example 14.39 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.38:
**Example 14.39. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John, | and | I | like | that-named | Martha  
.ijabo | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by __.i__ __ja__ first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by __.i__ __je__.
Eks can have __bo__ attached in exactly the same way, so that Example 14.40 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39:
**Example 14.40. **
mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with __bo__ , for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.
What happens if __bo__ is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in Example 14.41?
**Example 14.41. **
mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Does this wind up meaning the same as Example 14.34 and Example 14.36? Not at all. A second rule relating to __bo__ is that where several __bo__ -marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, Example 14.41 in fact means the same as Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with __bo__ should be avoided.
The use of __bo__ , therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of Example 14.37 and Example 14.38, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ are used with ijeks, and __ke__ and __ke'e__ with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (__ke__ and __ke'e__ are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.42. **
I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
  

where the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express Example 14.42 in afterthought, we can say:
**Example 14.43. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije[bo] | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me,  
.ijanai | mi | prami | do | .ijebo | do | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | I | love | you | and | you | love | me.  
  

marking two of the ijeks with __bo__ for high precedence. (The first __bo__ is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)
But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:
**Example 14.44. **
tu'e | mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me | )  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

where the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ pairs set off the structure. The cmavo __tu'u__ is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in Example 14.44 is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.
In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to __bo__ grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.
Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:
**Example 14.45. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider
**Example 14.46. **
I walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.
  

Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to Example 14.44, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with __ke__ , so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing Example 14.47, which is instead parallel to Example 14.45:
**Example 14.47. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | the | house  
.a | ke | le | ckule | .e | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | the | school | and | the | office | ).  
  

If sumti were allowed to begin with __ke__ , unavoidable ambiguities would result, so __ke__ grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to __tu'e__ grouping of bridi, as Example 14.44 shows.
Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of Example 14.33: “I am German, rich, and a man – or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:
**Example 14.48. **
[tu'e] | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-rich | )  
.ije | tu'e | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | nanmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | ( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-a-man | ).  
  

The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.

## 18.9. Approximation and inexact numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ji'i |  PA |  approximately  
---|---|---  
su'e |  PA |  at most  
su'o |  PA |  at least  
me'i |  PA |  less than  
za'u |  PA |  more than  
The cmavo __ji'i__ (of selma'o PA) is used in several ways to indicate approximate or rounded numbers. If it appears at the beginning of a number, the whole number is approximate:
**Example 18.60. **
ji'i | vo | no  
---|---|---  
approximation | four | zero  
approximately 40  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears in the middle of a number, all the digits following it are approximate:
**Example 18.61. **
vo | no | ji'i | mu | no  
---|---|---|---|---  
four | zero | approximation | five | zero  
roughly 4050 (where the “four thousand” is exact, but the “fifty” is approximate)  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears at the end of a number, it indicates that the number has been rounded. In addition, it can then be followed by a sign cmavo (__ma'u__ or __ni'u__), which indicate truncation towards positive or negative infinity respectively.
**Example 18.62. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation  
2.72 (rounded)  
---  
  

**Example 18.63. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i | ma'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation | positive-sign  
2.72 (rounded up)  
---  
  

**Example 18.64. **
re | pi | ze | pa | ji'i | ni'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | one | approximation | negative-sign  
2.71 (rounded down)  
---  
  

Example 18.62 through Example 18.64 are all approximations to __te'o__ (exponential e). __ji'i__ can also appear by itself, in which case it means “approximately the typical value in this context”.
The four cmavo __su'e__ , __su'o__ , __me'i__ , and __za'u__ , also of selma'o PA, express inexact numbers with upper or lower bounds:
**Example 18.65. **
mi | catlu | su'e | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-most | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.66. **
mi | catlu | su'o | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.67. **
mi | catlu | me'i | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | less-than | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.68. **
mi | catlu | za'u | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | more-than | two | persons  
  

Each of these is a subtly different claim: Example 18.66 is true of two or any greater number, whereas Example 18.68 requires three persons or more. Likewise, Example 18.65 refers to zero, one, or two; Example 18.67 to zero or one. (Of course, when the context allows numbers other than non-negative integers, _me'i re_ can be any number less than 2, and likewise with the other cases.) The exact quantifier, “exactly 2, neither more nor less” is just __re__. Note that _su'ore_ is the exact Lojban equivalent of English plurals.
If no number follows one of these cmavo, __pa__ is understood: therefore,
**Example 18.69. **
mi | catlu | su'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least-[one] | person  
  

is a meaningful claim.
Like the numbers in Section 18.8, all of these cmavo may be preceded by __pi__ to make the corresponding quantifiers for part of a whole. For example, __pisu'o__ means “at least some part of”. The quantifiers __ro__ , __su'o__ , __piro__ , and __pisu'o__ are particularly important in Lojban, as they are implicitly used in the descriptions introduced by the cmavo of selma'o LA and LE, as explained in Section 6.7. Descriptions in general are outside the scope of this chapter.

## 6.6. Quantified sumti
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ro |  PA |  all of/each of  
---|---|---  
su'o |  PA |  at least (one of)  
Quantifiers tell us how many: in the case of quantifiers with sumti, how many things we are talking about. In Lojban, quantifiers are expressed by numbers and mathematical expressions: a large topic discussed in some detail in Chapter 18. For the purposes of this chapter, a simplified treatment will suffice. Our examples will employ either the simple Lojban numbers __pa__ , __re__ , __ci__ , __vo__ , and __mu__ , meaning “one”, “two”, “three”, “four”, “five” respectively, or else one of four special quantifiers, two of which are discussed in this section and listed above. These four quantifiers are important because every Lojban sumti has either one or two of them implicitly present in it – which one or two depends on the particular kind of sumti. There is more explanation of implicit quantifiers later in this section. (The other two quantifiers, __piro__ and __pisu'o__ , are explained in Section 6.7.)
Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit quantifier. The purpose of this quantifier is to specify how many of the things referred to by the sumti are being talked about. Here are some simple examples contrasting sumti with and without explicit quantifiers:
**Example 6.30. **
do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---  
You | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

**Example 6.31. **
re | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
Two-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

The difference between Example 6.30 and Example 6.31 is the presence of the explicit quantifier __re__ in the latter example. Although __re__ by itself means “two”, when used as a quantifier it means “two-of”. Out of the group of listeners (the number of which isn't stated), two (we are not told which ones) are asserted to be “walkers on the ice”. Implicitly, the others (if any) are not walkers on the ice. In Lojban, you cannot say “I own three shoes” if in fact you own four shoes. Numbers need never be specified, but if they are specified they must be correct.
(This rule does not mean that there is no way to specify a number which is vague. The sentence
**Example 6.32. **
mi | ponse | su'o | ci | cutci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | at-least | three | shoes.  
  

is true if you own three shoes, or four, or indeed any larger number. More details on vague numbers appear in the discussion of mathematical expressions in Chapter 18.)
Now consider Example 6.30 again. How many of the listeners are claimed to walk on the ice? The answer turns out to be: all of them, however many that is. So Example 6.30 and Example 6.33:
**Example 6.33. **
ro | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
All-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

turn out to mean exactly the same thing. This is a safe strategy, because if one of my listeners doesn't turn out to be walking on the ice, I can safely claim that I didn't intend that person to be a listener! And in fact, all of the personal pro-sumti such as __mi__ and __mi'o__ and __ko__ obey the same rule. We say that personal pro-sumti have a so-called “implicit quantifier” of __ro__ (all). This just means that if no quantifier is given explicitly, the meaning is the same as if the implicit quantifier had been used.
Not all sumti have __ro__ as the implicit quantifier, however. Consider the quotation in:
**Example 6.34. **
mi | cusku | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say, “You walk on the ice.”  
---  
  

What is the implicit quantifier of the quotation _lu do cadzu le bisli li'u_? Surely not __ro__. If __ro__ were supplied explicitly, thus:
**Example 6.35. **
mi | cusku | ro | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | all-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

the meaning would be something like “I say every occurrence of the sentence 'You walk on the ice'”. Of course I don't say every occurrence of it, only some occurrences. One might suppose that Example 6.34 means that I express exactly one occurrence, but it is more Lojbanic to leave the number unspecified, as with other sumti. We can say definitely, however, that I say it at least once.
The Lojban cmavo meaning “at least” is __su'o__ , and if no ordinary number follows, __su'o__ means “at least once”. (See Example 6.32 for the use of __su'o__ with an ordinary number). Therefore, the explicitly quantified version of Example 6.34 is
**Example 6.36. **
mi | cusku | su'o | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | at-least-one-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say one or more instances of “You walk on the ice”.  
---  
I say “You walk on the ice”.  
  

If an explicit ordinary number such as __re__ were to appear, it would have to convey an exact expression, so
**Example 6.37. **
mi | cusku | re | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | two-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

means that I say the sentence exactly twice, neither more nor less.

## 16.11. Using _naku_ outside a prenex
Let us consider the English sentence
**Example 16.79. **
Some children do not go to school.
  

We cannot express this directly with __na__ ; the apparently obvious translation
**Example 16.80. **
su'oda | poi | verba  
---|---|---  
At-least-one-X | which-are | child(ren)  
na | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
[false] | go-to | at-least-one-Y | which-are | school(s).  
  

when converted to the external negation form produces:
**Example 16.81. **
naku | zo'u | su'oda | poi | verba | cu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-false | that | some-which | are | children |   
klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---  
go-to | some-which | are | schools.  
All children don't go to some school (not just some children).  
---  
  

Lojban provides a negation form which more closely emulates natural language negation. This involves putting _naku_ before the selbri, instead of a __na__. _naku_ is clearly a contradictory negation, given its parallel with prenex bridi negation. Using _naku_ , Example 16.79 can be expressed as:
**Example 16.82. **
su'oda | poi | verba | naku | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | which-are | children | don't | go-to | some | which-are | schools.  
Some children don't go to a school.  
---  
  

Although it is not technically a sumti, _naku_ can be used in most of the places where a sumti may appear. We'll see what this means in a moment.
When you use _naku_ within a bridi, you are explicitly creating a negation boundary. As explained in Section 16.9, when a prenex negation boundary expressed by _naku_ moves past a quantifier, the quantifier has to be inverted. The same is true for _naku_ in the bridi proper. We can move _naku_ to any place in the sentence where a sumti can go, inverting any quantifiers that the negation boundary crosses. Thus, the following are equivalent to Example 16.82 (no good English translations exist):
**Example 16.83. **
su'oda | poi | verba | cu | klama | rode | poi | ckule | naku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For some children, for every school, they don't go to it.  
---  
  

**Example 16.84. **
su'oda | poi | verba | cu | klama | naku | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some children don't go to (some) school(s).  
---  
  

**Example 16.85. **
naku | roda | poi | verba | cu | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is false that all children go to some school(s).  
---  
  

In Example 16.83, we moved the negation boundary rightward across the quantifier of __de__ , forcing us to invert it. In Example 16.85 we moved the negation boundary across the quantifier of __da__ , forcing us to invert it instead. Example 16.84 merely switched the selbri and the negation boundary, with no effect on the quantifiers.
The same rules apply if you rearrange the sentence so that the quantifier crosses an otherwise fixed negation. You can't just convert the selbri of Example 16.82 and rearrange the sumti to produce
**Example 16.86. **
su'ode | poi | ckule | ku'o | naku | se | klama | roda | poi | verba  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some schools aren't gone-to-by every child.  
---  
  

or rather, Example 16.86 means something completely different from Example 16.82. Conversion with __se__ under _naku_ negation is not symmetric; not all sumti are treated identically, and some sumti are not invariant under conversion. Thus, internal negation with _naku_ is considered an advanced technique, used to achieve stylistic compatibility with natural languages.
It isn't always easy to see which quantifiers have to be inverted in a sentence. Example 16.82 is identical in meaning to:
**Example 16.87. **
su'o | verba | naku | klama | su'o | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | children | don't | go-to | some | school.  
  

but in Example 16.87, the bound variables __da__ and __de__ have been hidden.
It is trivial to export an internal bridi negation expressed with __na__ to the prenex, as we saw in Section 16.9; you just move it to the left end of the prenex. In comparison, it is non-trivial to export a _naku_ to the prenex because of the quantifiers. The rules for exporting _naku_ require that you export all of the quantified variables (implicit or explicit) along with _naku_ , and you must export them from left to right, in the same order that they appear in the sentence. Thus Example 16.82 goes into prenex form as:
**Example 16.88. **
su'oda | poi | verba | ku'o | naku  
---|---|---|---|---  
For-some-X | which | is-a-child, |  | it-is-not-the-case-that  
su'ode | poi | ckule | zo'u | da | klama | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-is-a-Y | which | is-a-school | such-that: | X | goes | to | Y.  
  

We can now move the _naku_ to the left end of the prenex, getting a contradictory negation that can be expressed with __na__ :
**Example 16.89. **
naku | roda | poi | verba  
---|---|---|---  
It-is-not-the-case-that | for-all-X's | which-are | children,  
su'ode | poi | ckule | zo'u | da | klama | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-is-a-Y | which-is | a-school | such-that: | X | goes-to | Y.  
  

from which we can restore the quantified variables to the sentence, giving:
**Example 16.90. **
naku | zo'u | roda | poi | verba | cu | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is not the case that all children go to some school.  
---  
  

or more briefly
**Example 16.91. **
ro | verba | cu | na | klama | su'o | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | children |  | [false] | go-to | some | school(s).  
  

As noted in Section 16.5, a sentence with two different quantified variables, such as Example 16.91, cannot always be converted with __se__ without first exporting the quantified variables. When the variables have been exported, the sentence proper can be converted, but the quantifier order in the prenex must remain unchanged:
**Example 16.92. **
roda | poi | verba | su'ode  
---|---|---|---  
for-all-X's | which-are | children, | there-is-a-Y  
poi | ckule | zo'u | de | na | se | klama | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
which | is-a-school | such-that: | Y |  |  | is-gone-to-by | X.  
  

While you can't freely convert with __se__ when you have two quantified variables in a sentence, you can still freely move sumti to either side of the selbri, as long as the order isn't changed. If you use __na__ negation in such a sentence, nothing special need be done. If you use _naku_ negation, then quantified variables that cross the negation boundary must be inverted.
Clearly, if all of Lojban negation was built on _naku_ negation instead of __na__ negation, logical manipulation in Lojban would be as difficult as in natural languages. In Section 16.12, for example, we'll discuss DeMorgan's Law, which must be used whenever a sumti with a logical connection is moved across a negation boundary.
Since _naku_ has the grammar of a sumti, it can be placed almost anywhere a sumti can go, including __be__ and __bei__ clauses; it isn't clear what these mean, and we recommend avoiding such constructs.
You can put multiple _naku_ compounds in a sentence, each forming a separate negation boundary. Two adjacent _naku_ compounds in a bridi are a double negative and cancel out:
**Example 16.93. **
mi naku naku le zarci cu klama
  

Other expressions using two _naku_ compounds may or may not cancel out. If there is no quantified variable between them, then the _naku_ compounds cancel.
Negation with internal _naku_ is clumsy and non-intuitive for logical manipulations, but then, so are the natural language features it is emulating.

## 8.10. Relative clauses within relative clauses
For the most part, these are straightforward and uncomplicated: a sumti that is part of a relative clause bridi may itself be modified by a relative clause:
**Example 8.81. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | blanu | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | is-blue |  | is-slow.  
  

However, an ambiguity can exist if __ke'a__ is used in a relative clause within a relative clause: does it refer to the outermost sumti, or to the sumti within the outer relative clause to which the inner relative clause is attached? The latter. To refer to the former, use a subscript on __ke'a__ :
**Example 8.82. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'axire | zbasu | ke'a | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | IT-sub-2 | built | IT |  | is-slow.  
The person who is in the room which he built is slow.  
---  
  

Here, the meaning of “IT-sub-2” is that sumti attached to the second relative clause, counting from the innermost, is used. Therefore, _ke'axipa_ (IT-sub-1) means the same as plain __ke'a__.
Alternatively, you can use a prenex (explained in full in Chapter 16), which is syntactically a series of sumti followed by the special cmavo __zo'u__ , prefixed to the relative clause bridi:
**Example 8.83. **
le | prenu | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'a | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | who | (IT | = | it1 | :  
ko'a | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'e | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | is-in | the | room | which | (IT | = | it2 | :  
ko'a | zbasu | ko'e | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | built | it2) |  | is-slow.  
  

Example 8.83 is more verbose than Example 8.82, but may be clearer, since it explicitly spells out the two __ke'a__ cmavo, each on its own level, and assigns them to the assignable cmavo __ko'a__ and __ko'e__ (explained in Section 7.5).

## 7.15. lujvo based on pro-sumti
There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See Section 7.16 for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.
Thus __donta'a__ , meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted as _tavla be do_ , and would have the place structure
**Example 7.76. **
> t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
  

since `t2` (the addressee) is already known to be __do__.
On the other hand, the lujvo __donma'o__ , literally “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal pronoun”, would be interpreted as _cmavo be zo do_ , and have the place structure:
**Example 7.77. **
> c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
  

since both the `c2` place (the grammatical class) and the `c3` place (the meaning) are obvious from the context __do__.
An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the __fo'a__ series is to express lujvo which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An example would be:
**Example 7.78. **
fo'a | goi | le | kulnrsu,omi | .i | lo | fo'arselsanga  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x6 | stands-for | the | Finnish-culture | . | An | x6-song.  
  

Finally, lujvo involving __zi'o__ are also possible, and are fully discussed in Chapter 12. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for __zi'o__ as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a _se pinxe be zi'o_ , the lujvo corresponding to this is _zilrelselpinxe_ (deleting the second place of _se pinxe_). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that _zilpavypinxe_ has the same place structure as _zilrelselpinxe_ , and _lo zilpavypinxe_ , like _lo zilrelselpinxe_ , refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ , __du__ , and __bu'a__ also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for _du-_ based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.

## 18.2. Lojban numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
|  pa |  PA |  1  
---|---|---  
re |  PA |  2  
ci |  PA |  3  
vo |  PA |  4  
mu |  PA |  5  
|  xa |  PA |  6  
---|---|---  
ze |  PA |  7  
bi |  PA |  8  
so |  PA |  9  
no |  PA |  0  
The simplest kind of mekso are numbers, which are cmavo or compound cmavo. There are cmavo for each of the 10 decimal digits, and numbers greater than 9 are made by stringing together the cmavo. Some examples:
**Example 18.2. **
pa | re | ci  
---|---|---  
one | two | three  
123  
one hundred and twenty three  
---  
  

**Example 18.3. **
pa | no  
---|---  
one | zero  
10  
ten  
---  
  

**Example 18.4. **
pa | re | ci | vo | mu | xa | ze | bi | so | no  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
one | two | three | four | five | six | seven | eight | nine | zero  
1234567890  
one billion, two hundred and thirty-four million, five hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and ninety.  
---  
  

Therefore, there are no separate cmavo for “ten”, “hundred”, etc.
There is a pattern to the digit cmavo (except for __no__ , 0) which is worth explaining. The cmavo from 1 to 5 end in the vowels _a_ , _e_ , _i_ , _o_ , _u_ respectively; and the cmavo from 6 to 9 likewise end in the vowels _a_ , _e_ , _i_ , and _o_ respectively. None of the digit cmavo begin with the same consonant, to make them easy to tell apart in noisy environments.

## 18.8. Indefinite numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ro |  PA |  all  
---|---|---  
so'a |  PA |  almost all  
so'e |  PA |  most  
so'i |  PA |  many  
so'o |  PA |  several  
so'u |  PA |  a few  
no'o |  PA |  the typical number of  
da'a |  PA |  all but (one) of  
piro |  PA+PA |  the whole of/all of  
piso'a |  PA+PA |  almost the whole of  
piso'e |  PA+PA |  most of  
piso'i |  PA+PA |  much of  
piso'o |  PA+PA |  a small part of  
piso'u |  PA+PA |  a tiny part of  
pino'o |  PA+PA |  the typical portion of  
rau |  PA |  enough  
du'e |  PA |  too many  
mo'a |  PA |  too few  
pirau |  PA+PA |  enough of  
pidu'e |  PA+PA |  too much of  
pimo'a |  PA+PA |  too little of  
Not all the cmavo of PA represent numbers in the usual mathematical sense. For example, the cmavo __ro__ means “all” or “each”. This number does not have a definite value in the abstract: _li ro_ is undefined. But when used to count or quantify something, the parallel between __ro__ and __pa__ is clearer:
**Example 18.41. **
mi | catlu | pa | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | one | person  
  

**Example 18.42. **
mi | catlu | ro | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all | persons  
  

Example 18.41 might be true, whereas Example 18.42 is almost certainly false.
The cmavo __so'a__ , __so'e__ , __so'i__ , __so'o__ , and __so'u__ represent a set of indefinite numbers less than __ro__. As you go down an alphabetical list, the magnitude decreases:
**Example 18.43. **
mi | catlu | so'a | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | almost-all | persons  
  

**Example 18.44. **
mi | catlu | so'e | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | most | persons  
  

**Example 18.45. **
mi | catlu | so'i | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | many | persons  
  

**Example 18.46. **
mi | catlu | so'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | several | persons  
  

**Example 18.47. **
mi | catlu | so'u | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | a-few | persons  
  

The English equivalents are only rough: the cmavo provide space for up to five indefinite numbers between __ro__ and __no__ , with a built-in ordering. In particular, __so'e__ does not mean “most” in the sense of “a majority” or “more than half”.
Each of these numbers, plus __ro__ , may be prefixed with __pi__ (the decimal point) in order to make a fractional form which represents part of a whole rather than some elements of a totality. __piro__ therefore means “the whole of”:
**Example 18.48. **
mi | citka | piro | lei | nanba  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | eat | the-whole-of | the-mass-of | bread  
  

Similarly, __piso'a__ means “almost the whole of”; and so on down to __piso'u__ , “a tiny part of”. These numbers are particularly appropriate with masses, which are usually measured rather than counted, as Example 18.48 shows.
In addition to these cmavo, there is __no'o__ , meaning “the typical value”, and _pino'o_ , meaning “the typical portion”: Sometimes __no'o__ can be translated “the average value”, but the average in question is not, in general, a mathematical mean, median, or mode; these would be more appropriately represented by operators.
**Example 18.49. **
mi | catlu | no'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | a-typical-number-of | persons  
  

**Example 18.50. **
mi | citka | pino'o | lei | nanba  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | eat | a-typical-amount-of | the-mass-of | bread.  
  

__da'a__ is a related cmavo meaning “all but”:
**Example 18.51. **
mi | catlu | da'a | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all-but | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.52. **
mi | catlu | da'a | so'u | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all-but | a-few | persons  
  

Example 18.52 is similar in meaning to Example 18.43.
If no number follows __da'a__ , then __pa__ is assumed; __da'a__ by itself means “all but one”, or in ordinal contexts “all but the last”:
**Example 18.53. **
ro | ratcu | ka'e | citka | da'a | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | rats | can | eat | all-but-one | rats.  
All rats can eat all other rats.  
---  
  

(The use of __da'a__ means that Example 18.53 does not require that all rats can eat themselves, but does allow it. Each rat has one rat it cannot eat, but that one might be some rat other than itself. Context often dictates that “itself” is, indeed, the “other” rat.)
As mentioned in Section 18.3, __ma'u__ and __ni'u__ are also legal numbers, and they mean “some positive number” and “some negative number” respectively.
**Example 18.54. **
li | ci | vu'u | re | du | li | ma'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 3 | − | 2 | = |  | some-positive-number  
  

**Example 18.55. **
li | ci | vu'u | vo | du | li | ni'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 3 | − | 4 | = |  | some-negative-number  
  

**Example 18.56. **
mi | ponse | ma'u | rupnu  
---|---|---|---  
I | possess | a-positive-number-of | currency-units.  
  

All of the numbers discussed so far are objective, even if indefinite. If there are exactly six superpowers (_rairgugde_ , “superlative-states”) in the world, then _ro rairgugde_ means the same as _xa rairgugde_. It is often useful, however, to express subjective indefinite values. The cmavo __rau__ (enough), __du'e__ (too many), and __mo'a__ (too few) are then appropriate:
**Example 18.57. **
mi | ponse | rau | rupnu  
---|---|---|---  
I | possess | enough | currency-units.  
  

Like the __so'a__ -series, __rau__ , __du'e__ , and __mo'a__ can be preceded by __pi__ ; for example, _pirau_ means “a sufficient part of.”
Another possibility is that of combining definite and indefinite numbers into a single number. This usage implies that the two kinds of numbers have the same value in the given context:
**Example 18.58. **
mi | viska | le | rore | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | all-of/two | dogs.  
I saw both dogs.  
---  
  

**Example 18.59. **
mi | speni | so'ici | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | am-married-to | many/three | persons.  
I am married to three persons (which is “many” in the circumstances).  
---  
  

Example 18.59 assumes a mostly monogamous culture by stating that three is “many”.
