## 10.19. Actuality, potentiality, capability: CAhA
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ca'a |  CAhA |  actually is  
---|---|---  
ka'e |  CAhA |  is innately capable of  
nu'o |  CAhA |  can but has not  
pu'i |  CAhA |  can and has  
Lojban bridi without tense markers may not necessarily refer to actual events: they may also refer to capabilities or potential events. For example:
**Example 10.138. **
ro | datka | cu | flulimna  
---|---|---|---  
All | ducks |  | are-float-swimmers.  
All ducks swim by floating.  
---  
  

is a Lojban truth, even though the colloquial English translation is false or at best ambiguous. This is because the tenseless Lojban bridi doesn't necessarily claim that every duck is swimming or floating now or even at a specific time or place. Even if we add a tense marker to Example 10.138,
**Example 10.139. **
ro | datka | ca | flulimna  
---|---|---|---  
All | ducks | [present] | are-float-swimmers.  
All ducks are now swimming by floating.  
---  
  

the resulting Example 10.139 might still be considered a truth, even though the colloquial English seems even more likely to be false. All ducks have the potential of swimming even if they are not exercising that potential at present. To get the full flavor of “All ducks are now swimming”, we must append a marker from selma'o CAhA to the tense, and say:
**Example 10.140. **
ro | datka | ca | ca'a | flulimna  
---|---|---|---|---  
All | ducks | [present] | [actual] | are-float-swimmers.  
All ducks are now actually swimming by floating.  
---  
  

A CAhA cmavo is always placed after any other tense cmavo, whether for time or for space. However, a CAhA cmavo comes before __ki__ , so that a CAhA condition can be made sticky.
Example 10.140 is false in both Lojban and English, since it claims that the swimming is an actual, present fact, true of every duck that exists, whereas in fact there is at least one duck that is not swimming now.
Furthermore, some ducks are dead (and therefore sink); some ducks have just hatched (and do not know how to swim yet), and some ducks have been eaten by predators (and have ceased to exist as separate objects at all). Nevertheless, all these ducks have the innate capability of swimming – it is part of the nature of duckhood. The cmavo __ka'e__ expresses this notion of innate capability:
**Example 10.141. **
ro | datka | ka'e | flulimna  
---|---|---|---  
All | ducks | [capable] | are-float-swimmers.  
All ducks are innately capable of swimming.  
---  
  

Under some epistemologies, innate capability can be extended in order to apply the innate properties of a mass to which certain individuals belong to the individuals themselves, even if those individuals are themselves not capable of fulfilling the claim of the bridi. For example:
**Example 10.142. **
la | djan. | ka'e | viska  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [capable] | sees.  
John is innately capable of seeing.  
---  
John can see.  
  

might be true about a human being named John, even though he has been blind since birth, because the ability to see is innately built into his nature as a human being. It is theoretically possible that conditions might occur that would enable John to see (a great medical discovery, for example). On the other hand,
**Example 10.143. **
le | cukta | ka'e | viska  
---|---|---|---  
The | book | [capable] | sees.  
The book can see.  
---  
  

is not true in most epistemologies, since the ability to see is not part of the innate nature of a book.
Consider once again the newly hatched ducks mentioned earlier. They have the potential of swimming, but have not yet demonstrated that potential. This may be expressed using __nu'o__ , the cmavo of CAhA for undemonstrated potential:
**Example 10.144. **
ro | cifydatka | nu'o | flulimna  
---|---|---|---  
All | infant-ducks | [can-but-has-not] | are-float-swimmers.  
All infant ducks have an undemonstrated potential for swimming by floating.  
---  
Baby ducks can swim but haven't yet.  
  

Contrariwise, if Frank is not blind from birth, then __pu'i__ is appropriate:
**Example 10.145. **
la | frank. | pu'i | viska  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | [can-and-has] | sees.  
Frank has demonstrated a potential for seeing.  
---  
Frank can see and has seen.  
  

Note that the glosses given at the beginning of this section for __ca'a__ , __nu'o__ , and __pu'i__ incorporate __ca__ into their meaning, and are really correct for _ca ca'a_ , _ca nu'o_ , and _ca pu'i_. However, the CAhA cmavo are perfectly meaningful with other tenses than the present:
**Example 10.146. **
mi | pu | ca'a | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [actual] | go-to | the | store.  
I actually went to the store.  
---  
  

**Example 10.147. **
la | frank. | ba | nu'o | klama | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | [future] | [can-but-has-not] | goes-to | the | store.  
Frank could have, but will not have, gone to the store (at some understood moment in the future).  
---  
  

As always in Lojban tenses, a missing CAhA can have an indeterminate meaning, or the context can be enough to disambiguate it. Saying
**Example 10.148. **
ta | jelca  
---|---  
That | burns/is-burning/might-burn/will-burn.  
  

with no CAhA specified can translate the two very different English sentences “That is on fire” and “That is inflammable.” The first demands immediate action (usually), whereas the second merely demands caution. The two cases can be disambiguated with:
**Example 10.149. **
ta | ca | ca'a | jelca  
---|---|---|---  
That | [present] | [actual] | burns.  
That is on fire.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.150. **
ta | ka'e | jelca  
---|---|---  
That | [capable] | burns.  
That is capable of burning.  
---  
That is inflammable.  
  

When no indication is given, as in the simple observative
**Example 10.151. **
jelca  
---  
It burns!  
---  
  

the prudent Lojbanist will assume the meaning “Fire!”

## 9.16. CV'V cmavo of selma'o BAI with irregular forms
There are 65 cmavo of selma'o BAI, of which all but one (__do'e__ , discussed in Section 9.6), are derived directly from selected gismu. Of these 64 cmavo, 36 are entirely regular and have the form CV'V, where C is the first consonant of the corresponding gismu, and the Vs are the two vowels of the gismu. The remaining BAI cmavo, which are irregular in one way or another, are listed in the table below. The table is divided into sub-tables according to the nature of the exception; some cmavo appear in more than one sub-table, and are so noted.

## 9.17. Complete table of BAI cmavo with rough English equivalents
The following table shows all the cmavo belonging to selma'o BAI, and has five columns. The first column is the cmavo itself; the second column is the gismu linked to it. The third column gives an English phrase which indicates the meaning of the cmavo; and the fourth column indicates its meaning when preceded by __se__.
For those cmavo with meaningful __te__ , __ve__ , and even __xe__ conversions (depending on the number of places of the underlying gismu), the meanings of these are shown on one or two extra rows following the primary row for that cmavo.
It should be emphasized that the place structures of the gismu control the meanings of the BAI cmavo. The English phrases shown here are only suggestive, and are often too broad or too narrow to correctly specify what the acceptable range of uses for the modal tag are.

This lujvo is employed because __tarmi__ does not have a place structure useful for the modal's purpose.

## 14.7. More than two propositions
So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.
Of the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,
**Example 14.31. **
mi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,
**Example 14.32. **
mi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that one or more of the component sentences is true.
O, however, is different. Working out the truth table for
**Example 14.33. **
mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  
  

shows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:
> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.
Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.
In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.
There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: 
**Example 14.34. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  
.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

Does this mean:
**Example 14.35. **
I like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.
  

Or is the correct translation:
**Example 14.36. **
Either I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.
  

Example 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:
**Example 14.37. **
ga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | I | like | that-named | Martha)  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas
**Example 14.38. **
ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary).  
  

is not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.

## 14.8. Grouping of afterthought connectives
There are several ways in Lojban to render Example 14.35 using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo __bo__ (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with __bo__ are interpreted before connections not so marked. Example 14.39 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.38:
**Example 14.39. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John, | and | I | like | that-named | Martha  
.ijabo | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by __.i__ __ja__ first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by __.i__ __je__.
Eks can have __bo__ attached in exactly the same way, so that Example 14.40 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39:
**Example 14.40. **
mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with __bo__ , for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.
What happens if __bo__ is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in Example 14.41?
**Example 14.41. **
mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Does this wind up meaning the same as Example 14.34 and Example 14.36? Not at all. A second rule relating to __bo__ is that where several __bo__ -marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, Example 14.41 in fact means the same as Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with __bo__ should be avoided.
The use of __bo__ , therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of Example 14.37 and Example 14.38, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ are used with ijeks, and __ke__ and __ke'e__ with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (__ke__ and __ke'e__ are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.42. **
I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
  

where the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express Example 14.42 in afterthought, we can say:
**Example 14.43. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije[bo] | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me,  
.ijanai | mi | prami | do | .ijebo | do | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | I | love | you | and | you | love | me.  
  

marking two of the ijeks with __bo__ for high precedence. (The first __bo__ is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)
But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:
**Example 14.44. **
tu'e | mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me | )  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

where the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ pairs set off the structure. The cmavo __tu'u__ is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in Example 14.44 is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.
In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to __bo__ grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.
Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:
**Example 14.45. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider
**Example 14.46. **
I walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.
  

Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to Example 14.44, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with __ke__ , so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing Example 14.47, which is instead parallel to Example 14.45:
**Example 14.47. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | the | house  
.a | ke | le | ckule | .e | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | the | school | and | the | office | ).  
  

If sumti were allowed to begin with __ke__ , unavoidable ambiguities would result, so __ke__ grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to __tu'e__ grouping of bridi, as Example 14.44 shows.
Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of Example 14.33: “I am German, rich, and a man – or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:
**Example 14.48. **
[tu'e] | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-rich | )  
.ije | tu'e | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | nanmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | ( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-a-man | ).  
  

The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 7.6. Anaphoric pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the ri-series and the go'i-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ri |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats last sumti)   
---|---|---|---  
ra |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats previous sumti)  
ru |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats long-ago sumti)  
go'i |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last bridi)  
go'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats previous bridi)  
go'u |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats long-ago bridi)  
go'e |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last-but-one bridi)  
go'o |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats future bridi)  
nei |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats current bridi)  
no'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats outer bridi)  
ra'o |  RAhO |  |  pro-cmavo update  
The term “anaphora” literally means “repetition”, but is used in linguistics to refer to pronouns whose significance is the repetition of earlier words, namely their antecedents. Lojban provides three pro-sumti anaphora, __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ ; and three corresponding pro-bridi anaphora, __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__. These cmavo reveal the same vowel pattern as the ti-series, but the “distances” referred to are not physical distances, but distances from the anaphoric cmavo to its antecedent.
The cmavo __ri__ is the simplest of these; it has the same referent as the last complete sumti appearing before the __ri__ :
**Example 7.30. **
la | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | ri | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | [repeat-last-sumti] | room.  
Alice sleeps in her room.  
---  
  

The __ri__ in Example 7.30 is equivalent to repeating the last sumti, which is _la .alis._ , so Example 7.30 is equivalent to:
**Example 7.31. **
la | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | la | .alis. | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | that-named | Alice | room.  
Alice sleeps in Alice's room.  
---  
  

Note that __ri__ does not repeat _le ri kumfa_ , because that sumti is not yet complete when __ri__ appears. This prevents __ri__ from getting entangled in paradoxes of self-reference. (There are plenty of other ways to do that!) Note also that sumti within other sumti, as in quotations, abstractions, and the like, are counted in the order of their beginnings; thus a lower level sumti like _la alis._ in Example 7.31 is considered to be more recent than a higher level sumti that contains it.
Certain sumti are ignored by __ri__ ; specifically, most of the other cmavo of KOhA, and the almost-grammatically-equivalent lerfu words of selma'o BY. It is simpler just to repeat these directly:
**Example 7.32. **
mi | prami | mi  
---|---|---  
I | love | me.  
I love myself.  
---  
  

However, the cmavo of the ti-series can be picked up by __ri__ , because you might have changed what you are pointing at, so repeating __ti__ may not be effective. Likewise, __ri__ itself (or rather its antecedent) can be repeated by a later __ri__ ; in fact, a string of __ri__ cmavo with no other intervening sumti always all repeat the same sumti:
**Example 7.33. **
la | djan. | viska | le | tricu | .i  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | sees | the | tree. |   
ri | se jadni | le |  | ri | jimca  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[repeat-last] | is-adorned-by | the | of- | [repeat-last] | branch.  
John sees the tree. It is adorned by its branches.  
---  
  

Here the second __ri__ has as antecedent the first __ri__ , which has as antecedent _le tricu_. All three refer to the same thing: a tree.
To refer to the next-to-last sumti, the third-from-last sumti, and so on, __ri__ may be subscripted (subscripts are explained in Section 19.6):
**Example 7.34. **
lo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | rixire  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [repeat-next-to-last].  
.i | la | .alis. | pilno | riximu  
---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | uses | [repeat-fifth-from-last].  
  

Here _rixire_ , or “ri-sub-2”, skips _la rik._ to reach _lo forca_. In the same way, _riximu_ , or “ri-sub-5”, skips _la .alis._ , _rixire_ , _la rik._ , and _lo forca_ to reach _lo smuci_. As can clearly be seen, this procedure is barely practicable in writing, and would break down totally in speech.
Therefore, the vaguer __ra__ and __ru__ are also provided. The cmavo __ra__ repeats a recently used sumti, and __ru__ one that was further back in the speech or text. The use of __ra__ and __ru__ forces the listener to guess at the referent, but makes life easier for the speaker. Can __ra__ refer to the last sumti, like __ri__? The answer is no if __ri__ has also been used. If __ri__ has not been used, then __ra__ might be the last sumti. Likewise, if __ra__ has been used, then any use of __ru__ would repeat a sumti earlier than the one __ra__ is repeating. A more reasonable version of Example 7.34, but one that depends more on context, is:
**Example 7.35. **
lo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | ra  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [some-previous-thing].  
.i | la | .alis. | pilno | ru  
---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | uses | [some-more-remote-thing].  
  

In Example 7.35, the use of __ra__ tells us that something other than _la rik._ is the antecedent; _lo forca_ is the nearest sumti, so it is probably the antecedent. Similarly, the antecedent of __ru__ must be something even further back in the utterance than _lo forca_ , and _lo smuci_ is the obvious candidate.
The meaning of __ri__ must be determined every time it is used. Since __ra__ and __ru__ are more vaguely defined, they may well retain the same meaning for a while, but the listener cannot count on this behavior. To make a permanent reference to something repeated by __ri__ , __ra__ , or __ru__ , use __goi__ and a ko'a-series cmavo:
**Example 7.36. **
la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | goes-to | the | store  
.i | ri | goi | ko'a | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---  
. | It-last-mentioned | also-known-as | it-1 | is-blue.  
  

allows the store to be referred to henceforth as __ko'a__ without ambiguity. Example 7.36 is equivalent to Example 7.21 and eliminates any possibility of __ko'a__ being interpreted by the listener as referring to Alice.
The cmavo __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__ follow exactly the same rules as __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ , except that they are pro-bridi, and therefore repeat bridi, not sumti – specifically, main sentence bridi. Any bridi that are embedded within other bridi, such as relative clauses or abstractions, are not counted. Like the cmavo of the broda-series, the cmavo of the go'i-series copy all sumti with them. This makes __go'i__ by itself convenient for answering a question affirmatively, or for repeating the last bridi, possibly with new sumti:
**Example 7.37. **
xu | zo | .djan. | cmene | do | .i | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True-false?] | The-word |  “John” | is-the-name-of | you? |  | [repeat last bridi].  
Is John your name? Yes.  
---  
  

**Example 7.38. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | .i | do | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store | . | You | [repeat last bridi].  
I go to the store . You, too.  
---  
  

Note that Example 7.38 means the same as Example 7.26, but without the bother of assigning an actual broda-series word to the first bridi. For long-term reference, use _go'i cei broda_ or the like, analogously to _ri goi ko'a_ in Example 7.36.
The remaining four cmavo of the go'i-series are provided for convenience or for achieving special effects. The cmavo __go'e__ means the same as _go'ixire_ : it repeats the last bridi but one. This is useful in conversation:
**Example 7.39. **
A: | mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
A: | I | [future] | go-to | the | store.  
A: I am going to the store.  
---  
B: | mi | nelci | le | si'o | mi | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
B: | I | like | the | concept-of | I | [repeat-last-bridi].  
B: I like the idea of my going.  
---  
A: | do | go'e  
---|---|---  
A: | You | [repeat-last-bridi-but-one].  
A: You'll go, too.  
---  
  

Here B's sentence repeats A's within an abstraction (explained in Chapter 11): _le si'o mi go'i_ means _le si'o mi klama le zarci_. Why must B use the word __mi__ explicitly to replace the x1 of _mi klama le zarci_ , even though it looks like __mi__ is replacing __mi__? Because B's __mi__ refers to B, whereas A's __mi__ refers to A. If B said:
**Example 7.40. **
mi nelci le si'o go'i
  

that would mean:
> I like the idea of your going to the store.
The repetition signalled by __go'i__ is not literally of words, but of concepts. Finally, A repeats her own sentence, but with the x1 changed to __do__ , meaning B. Note that in Example 7.39, the tense __ba__ (future time) is carried along by both __go'i__ and __go'e__.
Descriptions based on go'i-series cmavo can be very useful for repeating specific sumti of previous bridi:
**Example 7.41. **
le | xekri | mlatu | cu | klama | le | zarci | .i | le  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | black | cat |  | goes-to | the | store. |  | That-described-as-the-x1-place-of  
go'i | cu | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
[repeat-last-bridi] |  | walks-on | the | ice.  
The black cat goes to the store. It walks on the ice.  
---  
  

Here the __go'i__ repeats _le xekri mlatu cu klama le zarci_ , and since __le__ makes the x1 place into a description, and the x1 place of this bridi is _le xekri mlatu_ , _le go'i_ means _le xekri mlatu_.
The cmavo __go'o__ , __nei__ , and __no'a__ have been little used so far. They repeat respectively some future bridi, the current bridi, and the bridi that encloses the current bridi (__no'a__ , unlike the other members of the go'i- series, can repeat non-sentence bridi). Here are a few examples:
**Example 7.42. **
mi | nupre | le | nu | mi | go'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | promise | the | event-of | I | [repeat-future-bridi].  
.i | ba | dunda | le | djini |  | le | bersa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [Future] | give | the | money | to | the | son  
.i | ba | dunda | le | zdani |  | le | tixnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [Future] | give | the | house | to | the | daughter  
I promise to do the following: Give the money to my son. Give the house to my daughter.  
---  
  

(Note: The Lojban does not contain an equivalent of the __my__ in the colloquial English; it leaves the fact that it is the speaker's son and daughter that are referred to implicit. To make the fact explicit, use _le bersa_ /_tixnu be mi_.)
For good examples of __nei__ and __no'a__ , we need nested bridi contexts:
**Example 7.43. **
mi | se | pluka | le | nu | do | pensi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | am-pleased-by | the | event-of | (you | think-about | the | (event-of  
nei | kei | pu | le | nu | do | zukte  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[main-bridi] | ) | before | the | (event-of | your | acting).  
I am pleased that you thought about whether I would be pleased (about ...) before you acted.  
---  
  

**Example 7.44. **
mi | ba | klama | ca | le | nu | do | no'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | go | [present] | the | event-of | you | [repeats outer bridi]  
I will go when you do.  
---  
  

Finally, __ra'o__ is a cmavo that can be appended to any go'i-series cmavo, or indeed any cmavo of selma'o GOhA, to signal that pro-sumti or pro-bridi cmavo in the antecedent are to be repeated literally and reinterpreted in their new context. Normally, any pro-sumti used within the antecedent of the pro-bridi keep their meanings intact. In the presence of __ra'o__ , however, their meanings must be reinterpreted with reference to the new environment. If someone says to you:
**Example 7.45. **
mi ba lumci le mi karce  
---  
I will wash my car.  
---  
  

you might reply either:
**Example 7.46. **
mi go'i  
---  
I will wash your car.  
---  
  

or:
**Example 7.47. **
mi go'i ra'o  
---  
I will wash my car.  
---  
  

The __ra'o__ forces the second __mi__ from the original bridi to mean the new speaker rather than the former speaker. This means that _go'e ra'o_ would be an acceptable alternative to _do go'e_ in B's statement in Example 7.39.
The anaphoric pro-sumti of this section can be used in quotations, but never refer to any of the supporting text outside the quotation, since speakers presumably do not know that they may be quoted by someone else.
However, a _ri-_ series or _go'a-_ series reference within a quotation can refer to something mentioned in an earlier quotation if the two quotations are closely related in time and context. This allows a quotation to be broken up by narrative material without interfering with the pro-sumti within it. Here's an example:
**Example 7.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | lu | mi | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | says | [quote] | I | go-to | the | store | [unquote].  
.i | la | .alis. | cusku | lu | mi | go'i | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | says | [quote] | I | [repeat] | [unquote].  
John says, “I am going to the store.” Alice says, “Me too.”  
---  
  

Of course, there is no problem with narrative material referring to something within a quotation: people who quote, unlike people who are quoted, are aware of what they are doing.

## 6.10. sumti qualifiers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
la'e |  LAhE |  something referred to by  
---|---|---  
lu'e |  LAhE |  a reference to  
tu'a |  LAhE |  an abstraction involving  
lu'a |  LAhE |  an individual/member/component of  
lu'i |  LAhE |  a set formed from  
lu'o |  LAhE |  a mass formed from  
vu'i |  LAhE |  a sequence formed from  
na'ebo |  NAhE+BO |  something other than  
to'ebo |  NAhE+BO |  the opposite of  
no'ebo |  NAhE+BO |  the neutral form of  
je'abo |  NAhE+BO |  that which indeed is  
lu'u |  LUhU |  elidable terminator for LAhE and NAhE+BO  
Well, that's quite a list of cmavo. What are they all about?
The above cmavo and compound cmavo are called the “sumti qualifiers”. All of them are either single cmavo of selma'o LAhE, or else compound cmavo involving a scalar negation cmavo of selma'o NAhE immediately followed by __bo__ of selma'o BO. Syntactically, you can prefix a sumti qualifier to any sumti and produce another simple sumti. (You may need to add the elidable terminator __lu'u__ to show where the qualified sumti ends.)
Semantically, sumti qualifiers represent short forms of certain common special cases. Suppose you want to say “I see 'The Red Pony'”, where “The Red Pony” is the title of a book. How about:
**Example 6.51. **
mi | viska | lu | le | xunre | cmaxirma | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | [quote] | the | red | small-horse | [unquote].  
  

But Example 6.51 doesn't work: it says that you see a piece of text “The Red Pony”. That might be all right if you were looking at the cover of the book, where the words “The Red Pony” are presumably written. (More precisely, where the words _le xunre cmaxirma_ are written – but we may suppose the book has been translated into Lojban.)
What you really want to say is:
**Example 6.52. **
mi | viska | le | selsinxa  
---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | thing-represented-by  
be | lu | le | xunre | cmaxirma | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [quote] | the | red | small-horse | [unquote].  
  

The x2 place of _selsinxa_ (the x1 place of __sinxa__) is a sign or symbol, and the x1 place of _selsinxa_ (the x2 place of __sinxa__) is the thing represented by the sign. Example 6.52 allows us to use a symbol (namely the title of a book) to represent the thing it is a symbol of (namely the book itself).
This operation turns out to be needed often enough that it's useful to be able to say:
**Example 6.53. **
mi | viska | la'e | lu | le | xunre | cmaxirma | li'u | [lu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the-referent-of | [quote] | the | red | small-horse | [unquote] | -.  
  

So when __la'e__ is prefixed to a sumti referring to a symbol, it produces a sumti referring to the referent of that symbol. (In computer jargon, __la'e__ dereferences a pointer.)
By introducing a sumti qualifier, we correct a false sentence (Example 6.51), which too closely resembles its literal English equivalent, into a true sentence (Example 6.53), without having to change it overmuch; in particular, the structure remains the same. Most of the uses of sumti qualifiers are of this general kind.
The sumti qualifier __lu'e__ provides the converse operation: it can be prefixed to a sumti referring to some thing to produce a sumti referring to a sign or symbol for the thing. For example,
**Example 6.54. **
mi | pu | cusku | lu'e | le | vi | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | express | a-symbol-for | the | nearby | book.  
I said the title of this book.  
---  
  

The equivalent form not using a sumti qualifier would be:
**Example 6.55. **
mi | pu | cusku | le | sinxa | be | le | vi | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | express | the | symbol-for |  | the | nearby | book.  
  

which is equivalent to Example 6.54, but longer.
The other sumti qualifiers follow the same rules. The cmavo __tu'a__ is used in forming abstractions, and is explained more fully in Section 11.11. The triplet __lu'a__ , __lu'i__ , and __lu'o__ convert between individuals, sets, and masses; __vu'i__ belongs to this group as well, but creates a sequence, which is similar to a set but has a definite order. (The set of John and Charles is the same as the set of Charles and John, but the sequences are different.) Here are some examples:
**Example 6.56. **
mi | troci | tu'a | le | vorme  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | try | some-abstraction-about | the | door.  
I try (to open) the door.  
---  
  

Example 6.56 might mean that I try to do something else involving the door; the form is deliberately vague.
Most of the following examples make use of the cmavo __ri__ , belonging to selma'o KOhA. This cmavo means “the thing last mentioned”; it is equivalent to repeating the immediately previous sumti (but in its original context). It is explained in more detail in Section 7.6.
**Example 6.57. **
lo'i | ratcu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---  
The-set-of | rats |  | is-large.  
.iku'i | lu'a | ri | cmalu  
---|---|---|---  
But | some-members-of | it-last-mentioned | are-small.  
The set of rats is large, but some of its members are small.  
---  
  

**Example 6.58. **
lo | ratcu | cu | cmalu | .iku'i | lu'i | ri | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | rats |  | are-small. | But | the-set-of | them-last-mentioned | is-large.  
Some rats are small, but the set of rats is large.  
---  
  

**Example 6.59. **
mi | ce | do | girzu  
---|---|---|---  
I | in-a-set-with | you | are-a-set.  
.i | lu'o | ri | gunma  
---|---|---|---  
| The-mass-of | it-last-mentioned | is-a-mass.  
.i | vu'i | ri | porsi  
| The-sequence-of | it-last-mentioned | is-a-sequence  
The set of you and me is a set. The mass of you and me is a mass. The sequence of you and me is a sequence.  
---  
  

(Yes, I know these examples are a bit silly. This set was introduced for completeness, and practical examples are as yet hard to come by.)
Finally, the four sumti qualifiers formed from a cmavo of NAhE and __bo__ are all concerned with negation, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 15. Here are a few examples of negation sumti qualifiers:
**Example 6.60. **
mi | viska | na'ebo | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | something-other-than | the | dog.  
  

This compound, _na'ebo_ , is the most common of the four negation sumti qualifiers. The others usually only make sense in the context of repeating, with modifications, something already referred to:
**Example 6.61. **
mi | nelci | loi | glare | cidja  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | part-of-the-mass-of | hot-type-of | food.  
.ije | do | nelci | to'ebo | ri  
---|---|---|---|---  
And | you | like | the-opposite-of | the-last-mentioned.  
.ije | la | djein. | nelci | no'ebo | ra  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
And | that-named | Jane | likes | the-neutral-value-of | something-mentioned.  
I like hot food, and you like cold food, and Jane likes lukewarm food.  
---  
  

(In Example 6.61, the sumti __ra__ refers to some previously mentioned sumti other than that referred to by __ri__. We cannot use __ri__ here, because it would signify _la djein._ , that being the most recent sumti available to __ri__. See more detailed explanations in Section 7.6.)

## 11.2. Event abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
nu |  NU |  event abstractor  
---|---|---  
The examples in Section 11.1 made use of __nu__ as the abstractor, and it is certainly the most common abstractor in Lojban text. Its purpose is to capture the event or state of the bridi considered as a whole. Do not confuse the __le__ description built on a __nu__ abstraction with ordinary descriptions based on __le__ alone. The following sumti are quite distinct:
**Example 11.5. **
le | klama  
---|---  
the comer, that which comes  
---  
  

**Example 11.6. **
le | se | klama  
---|---|---  
the destination  
---  
  

**Example 11.7. **
le | te | klama  
---|---|---  
the origin  
---  
  

**Example 11.8. **
le | ve | klama  
---|---|---  
the route  
---  
  

**Example 11.9. **
le | xe | klama  
---|---|---  
the means of transportation  
---  
  

**Example 11.10. **
le | nu | klama  
---|---|---  
the event of someone coming to somewhere from somewhere by some route using some means  
---  
  

Example 11.5 through Example 11.9 are descriptions that isolate the five individual sumti places of the selbri __klama__. Example 11.10 describes something associated with the bridi as a whole: the event of it.
In Lojban, the term “event” is divorced from its ordinary English sense of something that happens over a short period of time. The description:
**Example 11.11. **
le | nu | mi | vasxu  
---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | my | breathing  
  

is an event which lasts for the whole of my life (under normal circumstances). On the other hand,
**Example 11.12. **
le | nu | la | djan. | cinba | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | that-named | John | kissing | that-named | Jane  
  

is relatively brief by comparison (again, under normal circumstances).
We can see from Example 11.10 through Example 11.12 that ellipsis of sumti is valid in the bridi of abstraction selbri, just as in the main bridi of a sentence. Any sumti may be ellipsized if the listener will be able to figure out from context what the proper value of it is, or else to recognize that the proper value is unimportant. It is extremely common for __nu__ abstractions in descriptions to have the x1 place ellipsized:
**Example 11.13. **
mi | nelci | le | nu | limna  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | the | event-of | swimming.  
I like swimming.  
---  
  

is elliptical, and most probably means:
**Example 11.14. **
mi | nelci | le | nu | mi | limna  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | the | event-of | I | swim.  
  

In the proper context, of course, Example 11.13 could refer to the event of somebody else swimming. Its English equivalent, “I like swimming”, can't be interpreted as “I like Frank's swimming”; this is a fundamental distinction between English and Lojban. In Lojban, an omitted sumti can mean whatever the context indicates that it should mean.
Note that the lack of an explicit NU cmavo in a sumti can sometimes hide an implicit abstraction. In the context of Example 11.14, the appearance of _le se nelci_ (“that which is liked”) is in effect an abstraction:
**Example 11.15. **
le | se nelci | cu | cafne  
---|---|---|---  
The | liked-thing |  | is-frequent.  
The thing which I like happens often.  
---  
  

which in this context means
> My swimming happens often.
Event descriptions with _le nu_ are commonly used to fill the “under conditions...” places, among others, of gismu and lujvo place structures:
**Example 11.16. **
la | lojban. | cu | frili |  | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Lojban |  | is-easy-for | me  
| le | nu | mi | tadni | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
under-conditions | the | event-of | I | study  
Lojban is easy for me when I study.  
---  
  

(The “when” of the English would also be appropriate for a construction involving a Lojban tense, but the Lojban sentence says more than that the studying is concurrent with the ease.)
The place structure of a __nu__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> x1 is an event of (the bridi)

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.

## 5.4. Complex tanru grouping
If one element of a tanru can be another tanru, why not both elements?
**Example 5.25. **
do | mutce | bo | barda | gerku | bo | kavbu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-a-(very | type-of | large) | (dog | type-of | capturer).  
You are a very large dog-catcher.  
---  
  

In Example 5.25, the selbri is a tanru with seltau _mutce bo barda_ and tertau _gerku bo kavbu_. It is worth emphasizing once again that this tanru has the same fundamental ambiguity as all other Lojban tanru: the sense in which the “dog type-of capturer” is said to be “very type-of large” is not precisely specified. Presumably it is his body which is large, but theoretically it could be one of his other properties.
We will now justify the title of this chapter by exploring the ramifications of the phrase “pretty little girls' school”, an expansion of the tanru used in Section 5.3 to four brivla. (Although this example has been used in the Loglan Project almost since the beginning – it first appeared in Quine's book _Word and Object_ (1960) – it is actually a mediocre example because of the ambiguity of English “pretty”; it can mean “beautiful”, the sense intended here, or it can mean “very”. Lojban __melbi__ is not subject to this ambiguity: it means only “beautiful”.)
Here are four ways to group this phrase:
**Example 5.26. **
ta | melbi |  | cmalu |  | nixli |  | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-((pretty | type-of | little) | type-of | girl) | type-of | school.  
That is a school for girls who are beautifully small.  
---  
  

**Example 5.27. **
ta | melbi |  | cmalu | nixli | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-(pretty | type-of | little) | (girl | type-of | school).  
That is a girls' school which is beautifully small.  
---  
  

**Example 5.28. **
ta | melbi |  | cmalu | bo | nixli |  | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-(pretty | type-of | (little | type-of | girl)) | type-of | school.  
That is a school for small girls who are beautiful.  
---  
  

**Example 5.29. **
ta | melbi |  | cmalu | bo | nixli | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-pretty | type-of | (little | type-of | (girl | type-of | school)).  
That is a small school for girls which is beautiful.  
---  
  

Example 5.29 uses a construction which has not been seen before: _cmalu bo nixli bo ckule_ , with two consecutive uses of __bo__ between brivla. The rule for multiple __bo__ constructions is the opposite of the rule when no __bo__ is present at all: the last two are grouped together. Not surprisingly, this is called the “right-grouping rule”, and it is associated with every use of __bo__ in the language. Therefore,
**Example 5.30. **
ta | cmalu | bo | nixli | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-little | type-of | (girl | type-of | school).  
  

means the same as Example 5.19, not Example 5.20. This rule may seem peculiar at first, but one of its consequences is that __bo__ is never necessary between the first two elements of any of the complex tanru presented so far: all of Example 5.26 through Example 5.29 could have __bo__ inserted between __melbi__ and __cmalu__ with no change in meaning.

## 5.3. Three-part tanru grouping with _bo_
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
bo |  BO |  closest scope grouping  
---|---|---  
Consider the English sentence:
**Example 5.16. **
That's a little girls' school.
  

What does it mean? Two possible readings are:
**Example 5.17. **
That's a little school for girls.
  

**Example 5.18. **
That's a school for little girls.
  

This ambiguity is quite different from the simple tanru ambiguity described in Section 5.2. We understand that “girls' school” means “a school where girls are the students”, and not “a school where girls are the teachers” or “a school which is a girl” (!). Likewise, we understand that “little girl” means “girl who is small”. This is an ambiguity of grouping. Is “girls' school” to be taken as a unit, with “little” specifying the type of girls' school? Or is “little girl” to be taken as a unit, specifying the type of school? In English speech, different tones of voice, or exaggerated speech rhythm showing the grouping, are used to make the distinction; English writing usually leaves it unrepresented.
Lojban makes no use of tones of voice for any purpose; explicit words are used to do the work. The cmavo __bo__ (which belongs to selma'o BO) may be placed between the two brivla which are most closely associated. Therefore, a Lojban translation of Example 5.17 would be:
**Example 5.19. **
ta | cmalu | nixli | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-small | girl | - | school.  
  

Example 5.18 might be translated:
**Example 5.20. **
ta | cmalu | bo | nixli | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-small | - | girl | school.  
  

The __bo__ is represented in the literal translation by a bracketed hyphen (not to be confused with the bare hyphen used as a placeholder in other glosses) because in written English a hyphen is sometimes used for the same purpose: “a big dog-catcher” would be quite different from a “big-dog catcher” (presumably someone who catches only big dogs).
Analysis of Example 5.19 and Example 5.20 reveals a tanru nested within a tanru. In Example 5.19, the main tanru has a seltau of __cmalu__ and a tertau of _nixli bo ckule_ ; the tertau is itself a tanru with __nixli__ as the seltau and __ckule__ as the tertau. In Example 5.20, on the other hand, the seltau is _cmalu bo nixli_ (itself a tanru), whereas the tertau is __ckule__. This structure of tanru nested within tanru forms the basis for all the more complex types of selbri that will be explained below.
What about Example 5.21? What does it mean?
**Example 5.21. **
ta | cmalu | nixli | ckule  
---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-small | girl | school.  
  

The rules of Lojban do not leave this sentence ambiguous, as the rules of English do with Example 5.16. The choice made by the language designers is to say that Example 5.21 means the same as Example 5.20. This is true no matter what three brivla are used: the leftmost two are always grouped together. This rule is called the “left-grouping rule”. Left-grouping in seemingly ambiguous structures is quite common – though not universal – in other contexts in Lojban.
Another way to express the English meaning of Example 5.19 and Example 5.20, using parentheses to mark grouping, is:
**Example 5.22. **
ta | cmalu |  | nixli | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-small | type-of | (girl | type-of | school).  
  

**Example 5.23. **
ta | cmalu | bo | nixli |  | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-(small | type-of | girl) | type-of | school.  
  

Because “type-of” is implicit in the Lojban tanru form, it has no Lojban equivalent.
Note: It is perfectly legal, though pointless, to insert __bo__ into a simple tanru:
**Example 5.24. **
ta | klama | bo | jubme  
---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-goer | - | table.  
  

is a legal Lojban bridi that means exactly the same thing as Example 5.13, and is ambiguous in exactly the same ways. The cmavo __bo__ serves only to resolve grouping ambiguity: it says nothing about the more basic ambiguity present in all tanru.

## 9.7. Modal sentence connection: the causals
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ri'a |  BAI |  rinka modal: physical cause  
---|---|---  
ki'u |  BAI |  krinu modal: justification  
mu'i |  BAI |  mukti modal: motivation  
ni'i |  BAI |  nibli modal: logical entailment  
This section has two purposes. On the one hand, it explains the grammatical construct called “modal sentence connection”. On the other, it exemplifies some of the more useful BAI cmavo: the causals. (There are other BAI cmavo which have causal implications: __ja'e__ means “with result”, and so __seja'e__ means “with cause of unspecified nature”; likewise, __gau__ means “with agent” and __tezu'e__ means “with purpose”. These other modal cmavo will not be further discussed here, as my purpose is to explain modal sentence connection rather than Lojbanic views of causation.)
There are four causal gismu in Lojban, distinguishing different versions of the relationships lumped in English as “causal”:
_ _rinka_ _ |  event x1 physically causes event x2  
---|---  
_ _krinu_ _ |  event x1 is the justification for event x2  
_ _mukti_ _ |  event x1 is the (human) motive for event x2  
_ _nibli_ _ |  event x1 logically entails event x2  
Each of these gismu has a related modal: __ri'a__ , __ki'u__ , __mu'i__ , and __ni'i__ respectively. Using these gismu and these modals, we can create various causal sentences with different implications:
**Example 9.35. **
le | spati | cu | banro | ri'a | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | plant |  | grows | with-physical-cause | the | event-of  
do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
you | water | give | to | the | plant.  
The plant grows because you water it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.36. **
la | djan. | cpacu | le | pamoi | se jinga  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John | gets | the | first | prize  
ki'u | le | nu | la | djan. | jinga  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
with-justification | the | event-of | that-named | John | wins.  
John got the first prize because he won.  
---  
  

**Example 9.37. **
mi | lebna | le | cukta | mu'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | took | the | book | with-motivation  
le | nu | mi | viska | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | I | saw | the | book.  
I took the book because I saw it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.38. **
la | sokrates. | morsi | binxo | ni'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
| Socrates | dead | became | with-logical-justification  
le | nu | la | sokrates. | remna  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | that-named | Socrates | is-human.  
Socrates died because Socrates is human.  
---  
  

In Example 9.35 through Example 9.38, the same English word “because” is used to translate all four modals, but the types of cause being expressed are quite different. Let us now focus on Example 9.35, and explore some variations on it.
As written, Example 9.35 claims that the plant grows, but only refers to the event of watering it in an abstraction bridi (abstractions are explained in Chapter 11) without actually making a claim. If I express Example 9.35, I have said that the plant in fact grows, but I have not said that you actually water it, merely that there is a causal relationship between watering and growing. This is semantically asymmetrical. Suppose I wanted to claim that the plant was being watered, and only mention its growth as ancillary information? Then we could reverse the main bridi and the abstraction bridi, saying:
**Example 9.39. **
do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | water | give | to | the | plant  
seri'a | le | nu | ri | banro  
---|---|---|---|---  
with-physical-effect | the | event-of | it | grows.  
You water the plant; therefore, it grows.  
---  
  

with the __ri'a__ changed to __seri'a__. In addition, there are also symmetrical forms:
**Example 9.40. **
le | nu | do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati | cu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | (you | water | give | to | the | plant) |   
rinka | le | nu | le | spati | cu | banro  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
causes | the | event-of | (the | plant |  | grows).  
Your watering the plant causes its growth.  
---  
If you water the plant, then it grows.  
  

does not claim either event, but asserts only the causal relationship between them. So in Example 9.40, I am not saying that the plant grows nor that you have in fact watered it. The second colloquial translation shows a form of “if-then” in English quite distinct from the logical connective “if-then” explained in Chapter 14.
Suppose we wish to claim both events as well as their causal relationship? We can use one of two methods:
**Example 9.41. **
le | spati | cu | banro | .iri'abo | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | plant |  | grows. | Because | you  
djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---  
water | give | to | the | plant.  
The plant grows because you water it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.42. **
do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | water | give | to | the | plant.  
.iseri'abo | le | spati | cu | banro  
---|---|---|---|---  
Therefore | the | plant |  | grows.  
You water the plant; therefore, it grows.  
---  
  

The compound cmavo _.iri'abo_ and _.iseri'abo_ serve to connect two bridi, as the initial __i__ indicates. The final __bo__ is necessary to prevent the modal from “taking over” the following sumti. If the __bo__ were omitted from Example 9.41 we would have:
**Example 9.43. **
le | spati | cu | banro | .i | ri'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | plant |  | grows. |  | Because-of | you,  
| djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[something] | water | gives | to | the | plant.  
The plant grows. Because of you, water is given to the plant.  
---  
  

Because _ri'a do_ is a modal sumti in Example 9.43, there is no longer an explicit sumti in the x1 place of _djacu dunda_ , and the translation must be changed.
The effect of sentences like Example 9.41 and Example 9.42 is that the modal, __ri'a__ in this example, no longer modifies an explicit sumti. Instead, the sumti is implicit, the event given by a full bridi. Furthermore, there is a second implication: that the first bridi fills the x2 place of the gismu __rinka__ ; it specifies an event which is the effect. I am therefore claiming three things: that the plant grows, that you have watered it, and that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the two.
In principle, any modal tag can appear in a sentence connective of the type exemplified by Example 9.41 and Example 9.42. However, it makes little sense to use any modals which do not expect events or other abstractions to fill the places of the corresponding gismu. The sentence connective _.ibaubo_ is perfectly grammatical, but it is hard to imagine any two sentences which could be connected by an “in-language” modal. This is because a sentence describes an event, and an event can be a cause or an effect, but not a language.

## 9.17. Complete table of BAI cmavo with rough English equivalents
The following table shows all the cmavo belonging to selma'o BAI, and has five columns. The first column is the cmavo itself; the second column is the gismu linked to it. The third column gives an English phrase which indicates the meaning of the cmavo; and the fourth column indicates its meaning when preceded by __se__.
For those cmavo with meaningful __te__ , __ve__ , and even __xe__ conversions (depending on the number of places of the underlying gismu), the meanings of these are shown on one or two extra rows following the primary row for that cmavo.
It should be emphasized that the place structures of the gismu control the meanings of the BAI cmavo. The English phrases shown here are only suggestive, and are often too broad or too narrow to correctly specify what the acceptable range of uses for the modal tag are.

The lujvo __tamsmi__ on which __tai__ is based is derived from the tanru _tarmi simsa_ and has the place structure:

This lujvo is employed because __tarmi__ does not have a place structure useful for the modal's purpose.
