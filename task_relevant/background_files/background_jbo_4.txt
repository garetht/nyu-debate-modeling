## 10.17. Tensed logical connectives
The Lojban tense system interacts with the Lojban logical connective system. That system is a separate topic, explained in Chapter 14 and touched on only in summary here. By the rules of the logical connective system, Example 10.117 through Example 10.119 are equivalent in meaning:
**Example 10.117. **
la | teris. | satre | le | mlatu | .ije | la | teris. | satre | le | ractu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Terry strokes the cat. And Terry strokes the rabbit.  
---  
  

**Example 10.118. **
la | teris. | satre | le | mlatu | gi'e | satre | le | ractu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Terry strokes the cat and strokes the rabbit.  
---  
  

**Example 10.119. **
la | teris. | satre | le | mlatu | .e | le | ractu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Terry strokes the cat and the rabbit.  
---  
  

Suppose we wish to add a tense relationship to the logical connective “and”? To say that Terry strokes the cat and later strokes the rabbit, we can combine a logical connective with a tense connective by placing the logical connective first, then the tense, and then the cmavo __bo__ , thus:
**Example 10.120. **
la | teris. | satre | le | mlatu | .ijebabo | la | teris. | satre | le | ractu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Terry strokes the cat. And then Terry strokes the rabbit.  
---  
  

**Example 10.121. **
la | teris. | satre | le | mlatu | gi'ebabo | satre | le | ractu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Terry strokes the cat, and then strokes the rabbit.  
---  
  

**Example 10.122. **
la | teris. | satre | le | mlatu | .ebabo | le | ractu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Terry strokes the cat and then the rabbit.  
---  
  

Example 10.120 through Example 10.122 are equivalent in meaning. They are also analogous to Example 10.117 through Example 10.119 respectively. The __bo__ is required for the same reason as in Example 10.110: to prevent the __ba__ from functioning as a sumti tcita for the following sumti (or, in Example 10.121, from being attached to the following selbri).
In addition to the __bo__ construction of Example 10.120 through Example 10.122, there is also a form of tensed logical connective with __ke__ … __ke'e__ (__tu'e__ … __tu'u__ for sentences). The logical connective system makes Example 10.123 through Example 10.125 equivalent in meaning:
**Example 10.123. **
mi | bevri | le | dakli | .ije | tu'e | mi | bevri | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | carry | the | sack. | And | ( | I | carry | the | dog.  
.ija | mi | bevri | le | mlatu | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
And/or | I | carry | the | cat | ).  
I carry the sack. And I carry the dog, or I carry the cat, or I carry both.  
---  
  

**Example 10.124. **
mi | bevri | le | dakli | gi'eke | bevri | le | gerku | gi'a | bevri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | carry | the | sack | and | (carry | the | dog | and/or | carry  
le | mlatu  
---|---  
the | cat).  
I carry the sack, and also carry the dog or carry the cat or carry both.  
---  
  

**Example 10.125. **
mi | bevri | le | dakli | .eke | le | gerku | .a | le | mlatu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | carry | the | sack | and | (the | dog | or | the | cat).  
I carry the sack and also the dog or the cat or both.  
---  
  

Note the uniformity of the Lojban, as contrasted with the variety of ways in which the English provides for the correct grouping. In all cases, the meaning is that I carry the sack in any case, and either the cat or the dog or both.
To express that I carry the sack first (earlier in time), and then the dog or the cat or both simultaneously, I can insert tenses to form Example 10.126 through Example 10.128:
**Example 10.126. **
mi | bevri | le | dakli | .ije | ba | tu'e | mi | bevri | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | carry | the | sack. | And | [future] | ( | I | carry | the | dog.  
.ija | cabo | mi | bevri | le | mlatu | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
And/or | [present] | I | carry | the | cat. | )  
I carry the sack. And then I will carry the dog or I will carry the cat or I will carry both at once.  
---  
  

**Example 10.127. **
mi | bevri | le | dakli | gi'e | bake | bevri | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | carry | the | sack | and | [future] | (carry | the | dog  
gi'a | cabo | bevri | le | mlatu  
---|---|---|---|---  
and/or | [present] | carry | the | cat).  
I carry the sack and then will carry the dog or carry the cat or carry both at once.  
---  
  

**Example 10.128. **
mi | bevri | le | dakli | .e | bake | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | carry | the | sack | and | [future] | (the | dog  
.a | cabo | le | mlatu  
---|---|---|---  
and/or | [present] | the | cat).  
I carry the sack, and then the dog or the cat or both at once.  
---  
  

Example 10.126 through Example 10.128 are equivalent in meaning to each other, and correspond to the tenseless Example 10.123 through Example 10.125 respectively.

## 9.11. Mixed modal connection
It is possible to mix logical connection (explained in Chapter 14) with modal connection, in a way that simultaneously asserts the logical connection and the modal relationship. Consider the sentences:
**Example 9.74. **
mi | nelci | do | .ije | mi | nelci | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | And | I | like | that-named | Jane.  
  

which is a logical connection, and
**Example 9.75. **
mi | nelci | do | .iki'ubo | mi | nelci | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | Justified-by | I | like | that-named | Jane.  
  

The meanings of Example 9.74 and Example 9.75 can be simultaneously expressed by combining the two compound cmavo, thus:
**Example 9.76. **
mi | nelci | do | .ijeki'ubo | mi | nelci | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | And-justified-by | I | like | that-named | Jane.  
  

Here the two sentences _mi nelci do_ and _mi nelci la djein._ are simultaneously asserted, their logical connection is asserted, and their causal relationship is asserted. The logical connective __je__ comes before the modal __ki'u__ in all such mixed connections.
Since _mi nelci do_ and _mi nelci la djein._ differ only in the final sumti, we can transform Example 9.76 into a mixed sumti connection:
**Example 9.77. **
mi | nelci | do | .eki'ubo | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | and/because | that-named | Jane.  
  

Note that this connection is an afterthought one. Mixed connectives are always afterthought; forethought connectives must be either logical or modal.
There are numerous other afterthought logical and non-logical connectives that can have modal information planted within them. For example, a bridi-tail connected version of Example 9.77 would be:
**Example 9.78. **
mi | nelci | do | gi'eki'ubo | nelci | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | and/because | like | that-named | Jane.  
  

The following three complex examples all mean the same thing.
**Example 9.79. **
mi | bevri | le | dakli  
---|---|---|---  
I | carry | the | sack.  
.ijeseri'abo | tu'e | mi | bevri | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
And-[effect] | ( | I | carry | the | dog.  
.ijadu'ibo | mi | bevri | le | mlatu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
And/or-[equal] | I | carry | the | cat. | )  
I carry the sack. As a result I carry the dog or I carry the cat, equally.  
---  
  

**Example 9.80. **
mi | bevri | le | dakli  
---|---|---|---  
I | carry | the | sack  
gi'eseri'ake | bevri | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---  
and-[effect] | (carry | the | dog  
gi'adu'ibo | bevri | le | mlatu | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and/or-[equal] | carry | the | cat) |   
I carry the sack and as a result carry the dog or carry the cat equally.  
---  
  

**Example 9.81. **
mi | bevri | le | dakli  
---|---|---|---  
I | carry | the | sack  
.eseri'ake | le | gerku  
---|---|---  
and-[effect] | (the | dog  
.adu'ibo | le | mlatu | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---  
and/or-[equal] | the | cat) |   
I carry the sack, and as a result the cat or the dog equally.  
---  
  

In Example 9.79, the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ brackets are the equivalent of the __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets in Example 9.80 and Example 9.81, because __ke__ … __ke'e__ cannot extend across more than one sentence. It would also be possible to change the _.ijeseri'abo_ to _.ije seri'a_ , which would show that the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ portion was an effect, but would not pin down the _mi bevri le dakli_ portion as the cause. It is legal for a modal (or a tense; see Chapter 10) to modify the whole of a __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ construct.
Note: The uses of modals discussed in this section are applicable both to BAI modals and to _fi'o-_ plus-selbri modals.

## 2.14. Vocatives and commands
You may call someone's attention to the fact that you are addressing them by using __doi__ followed by their name. The sentence
**Example 2.55. **
doi djan.
  

means “Oh, John, I'm talking to you”. It also has the effect of setting the value of __do__ ; __do__ now refers to “John” until it is changed in some way in the conversation. Note that Example 2.55 is not a bridi, but it is a legitimate Lojban sentence nevertheless; it is known as a “vocative phrase”.
Other cmavo can be used instead of __doi__ in a vocative phrase, with a different significance. For example, the cmavo __coi__ means “hello” and __co'o__ means “good-bye”. Either word may stand alone, they may follow one another, or either may be followed by a pause and a name. (Vocative phrases with __doi__ do not need a pause before the name.)
**Example 2.56. **
coi. | djan.  
---|---  
Hello, | John.  
  

**Example 2.57. **
co'o. | djan.  
---|---  
Good-bye, | John.  
  

Commands are expressed in Lojban by a simple variation of the main bridi structure. If you say
**Example 2.58. **
do |  tavla  
---|---  
You |  are-talking.  
  

you are simply making a statement of fact. In order to issue a command in Lojban, substitute the word __ko__ for __do__. The bridi
**Example 2.59. **
ko |  tavla  
---|---  
  

instructs the listener to do whatever is necessary to make Example 2.58 true; it means “Talk!” Other examples:
**Example 2.60. **
ko |  sutra  
---|---  
Be fast!  
---  
  

The __ko__ need not be in the x1 place, but rather can occur anywhere a sumti is allowed, leading to possible Lojban commands that are very unlike English commands:
**Example 2.61. **
mi |  tavla |  ko  
---|---|---  
Be talked to by me.  
---  
Let me talk to you.  
  

The cmavo __ko__ can fill any appropriate sumti place, and can be used as often as is appropriate for the selbri:
**Example 2.62. **
ko |  kurji |  ko  
---|---|---  
  

and
**Example 2.63. **
ko |  ko |  kurji  
---|---|---  
  

both mean “You take care of you” and “Be taken care of by you”, or to put it colloquially, “Take care of yourself”.

## 7.2. Personal pro-sumti: the mi-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
mi |  KOhA |  mi-series |  I, me   
---|---|---|---  
do |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you  
mi'o |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and I  
mi'a |  KOhA |  mi-series |  I and others, we but not you  
ma'a |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and I and others  
do'o |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and others  
ko |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you-imperative  
The mi-series of pro-sumti refer to the speaker, the listener, and others in various combinations. __mi__ refers to the speaker and perhaps others for whom the speaker speaks; it may be a Lojbanic mass. __do__ refers to the listener or listeners. Neither __mi__ nor __do__ is specific about the number of persons referred to; for example, the foreman of a jury may refer to the members of the jury as __mi__ , since in speaking officially he represents all of them.
The referents of __mi__ and __do__ are usually obvious from the context, but may be assigned by the vocative words of selma'o COI, explained in Section 13.14. The vocative __mi'e__ assigns __mi__ , whereas all of the other vocatives assign __do__.
**Example 7.5. **
mi'e | .djan. | doi | frank. | mi | cusku | lu | mi | bajra | li'u |  | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I-am | John, | O | Frank, | I | express | [quote] | I | run | [unquote] | to | you  
I am John, Frank; I tell you “I run”.  
---  
  

The cmavo __mi'o__ , __mi'a__ , __ma'a__ , and __do'o__ express various combinations of the speaker and/or the listener and/or other people:
  * __mi'o__ includes only the speaker and the listener but no one else;
  * __mi'a__ includes the speaker and others but excludes the listener;
  * __do'o__ includes the listener and others but excludes the speaker;
  * __ma'a__ includes all three: speaker, listener, others.


All of these pro-sumti represent masses. For example, __mi'o__ is the same as _mi joi do_ , the mass of me and you considered jointly.
In English, “we” can mean __mi__ or __mi'o__ or __mi'a__ or even __ma'a__ , and English-speakers often suffer because they cannot easily distinguish __mi'o__ from __mi'a__ :
**Example 7.6. **
We're going to the store.
  

Does this include the listener or not? There's no way to be sure.
Finally, the cmavo __ko__ is logically equivalent to __do__ ; its referent is the listener. However, its use alters an assertion about the listener into a command to the listener to make the assertion true:
**Example 7.7. **
do | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
You | go-to | the | store.  
  

becomes:
**Example 7.8. **
ko | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
You [imperative] | go-to | the | store.  
Make “you go to the store” true!  
---  
Go to the store!  
  

In English, the subject of a command is omitted, but in Lojban, the word __ko__ must be used. However, __ko__ does not have to appear in the x1 place:
**Example 7.9. **
mi | viska | ko  
---|---|---  
I | see | you-[imperative]  
Make “I see you” true!  
---  
Be seen by me!  
  

In Example 7.9, it is necessary to make the verb passive in English in order to convey the effect of __ko__ in the x2 place. Indeed, __ko__ does not even have to be a sumti of the main bridi:
**Example 7.10. **
mi | viska | le | prenu | poi | prami | ko  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | person | that | loves | you-[imperative]  
Make “I see the person that loves you” true!  
---  
Be such that the person who loves you is seen by me!  
Show me the person who loves you!  
  

As mentioned in Section 7.1, some pro-sumti series have corresponding pro-bridi series. However, there is no equivalent of the mi-series among pro-bridi, since a person isn't a relationship.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

# Chapter 8. Relative Clauses, Which Make sumti Even More Complicated
## 8.1. What are you pointing at?
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
poi |  NOI |  restrictive relative clause introducer  
---|---|---  
ke'a |  GOhA |  relative pro-sumti  
ku'o |  KUhO |  relative clause terminator  
Let us think about the problem of communicating what it is that we are pointing at when we are pointing at something. In Lojban, we can refer to what we are pointing at by using the pro-sumti __ti__ if it is nearby, or __ta__ if it is somewhat further away, or __tu__ if it is distant. (Pro-sumti are explained in full in Chapter 7.)
However, even with the assistance of a pointing finger, or pointing lips, or whatever may be appropriate in the local culture, it is often hard for a listener to tell just what is being pointed at. Suppose one is pointing at a person (in particular, in the direction of his or her face), and says:
**Example 8.1. **
ti | cu | barda  
---|---|---  
This-one |  | is-big.  
  

What is the referent of __ti__? Is it the person? Or perhaps it is the person's nose? Or even (for __ti__ can be plural as well as singular, and mean “these ones” as well as “this one”) the pores on the person's nose?
To help solve this problem, Lojban uses a construction called a “relative clause”. Relative clauses are usually attached to the end of sumti, but there are other places where they can go as well, as explained later in this chapter. A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable terminator __ku'o__ (of selma'o KUhO). As you might suppose, __noi__ is a cmavo of selma'o NOI; however, first we will discuss the cmavo __poi__ , which also belongs to selma'o NOI.
In between the __poi__ and the __ku'o__ appears a full bridi, with the same syntax as any other bridi. Anywhere within the bridi of a relative clause, the pro-sumti __ke'a__ (of selma'o KOhA) may be used, and it stands for the sumti to which the relative clause is attached (called the “relativized sumti”). Here are some examples before we go any further:
**Example 8.2. **
ti | poi | ke'a | prenu | ku'o | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | such-that-( | IT | is-a-person | ) |  | is-large.  
This thing which is a person is big.  
---  
This person is big.  
  

**Example 8.3. **
ti | poi | ke'a | nazbi | ku'o | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | such-that-( | IT | is-a-nose | ) |  | is-large.  
This thing which is a nose is big.  
---  
This nose is big.  
  

**Example 8.4. **
ti | poi | ke'a | nazbi |  | kapkevna | ku'o | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | such-that-( | IT | is-a-nose | type-of | skin-hole | ) |  | is-big.  
These things which are nose-pores are big.  
---  
These nose-pores are big.  
  

In the literal translations throughout this chapter, the word “IT”, capitalized, is used to represent the cmavo __ke'a__. In each case, it serves to represent the sumti (in Example 8.2 through Example 8.4, the cmavo __ti__) to which the relative clause is attached.
Of course, there is no reason why __ke'a__ needs to appear in the x1 place of a relative clause bridi; it can appear in any place, or indeed even in a sub-bridi within the relative clause bridi. Here are two more examples:
**Example 8.5. **
tu | poi | le | mlatu | pu | lacpu | ke'a | ku'o | cu | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-distant-thing | such-that-( | the | cat | [past] | drags | IT | ) |  | is-a-rat.  
That thing which the cat dragged is a rat.  
---  
What the cat dragged is a rat.  
  

**Example 8.6. **
ta | poi | mi | djica | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-thing | such-that-( | I | desire | the | event-of(  
mi | ponse | ke'a | [kei] | ku'o | cu | bloti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | own | IT | ) | ) |  | is-a-boat.  
That thing that I want to own is a boat.  
---  
  

In Example 8.6, __ke'a__ appears in an abstraction clause (abstractions are explained in Chapter 11) within a relative clause.
Like any sumti, __ke'a__ can be omitted. The usual presumption in that case is that it then falls into the x1 place:
**Example 8.7. **
ti | poi | nazbi | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | which | is-a-nose |  | is-big.  
  

almost certainly means the same thing as Example 8.3. However, __ke'a__ can be omitted if it is clear to the listener that it belongs in some place other than x1:
**Example 8.8. **
tu | poi | le | mlatu | pu | lacpu | cu | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-distant-thing | which | the | cat | [past] | drags |  | is-a-rat  
  

is equivalent to Example 8.4.
As stated before, __ku'o__ is an elidable terminator, and in fact it is almost always elidable. Throughout the rest of this chapter, __ku'o__ will not be written in any of the examples unless it is absolutely required: thus, Example 8.2 can be written:
**Example 8.9. **
ti | poi | prenu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---  
That | which | is-a-person |  | is-big.  
That person is big.  
---  
  

without any change in meaning. Note that __poi__ is translated “which” rather than “such-that” when __ke'a__ has been omitted from the x1 place of the relative clause bridi. The word “which” is used in English to introduce English relative clauses: other words that can be used are “who” and “that”, as in:
**Example 8.10. **
I saw a man who was going to the store.
  

and
**Example 8.11. **
The building that the school was located in is large.
  

In Example 8.10 the relative clause is “who was going to the store”, and in Example 8.11 it is “that the school was located in”. Sometimes “who”, “which”, and “that” are used in literal translations in this chapter in order to make them read more smoothly.

## 16.5. Dropping the prenex
It isn't really necessary for every Lojban bridi involving variables to have a prenex on the front. In fact, none of the examples we've seen so far required prenexes at all! The rule for dropping the prenex is simple: if the variables appear in the same order within the bridi as they did in the prenex, then the prenex is superfluous. However, any __ro__ or __poi__ appearing in the prenex must be transferred to the first occurrence of the variable in the main part of the bridi. Thus, Example 16.9 becomes just:
**Example 16.25. **
da | viska | mi  
---|---|---  
There-is-an-X-which | sees | me.  
Something sees me.  
---  
  

and Example 16.23 becomes:
**Example 16.26. **
ro | da | poi | gerku | cu | vasxu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X | which | is-a-dog, |  | it-breathes.  
Every dog breathes.  
---  
  

You might well suppose, then, that the purpose of the prenex is to allow the variables in it to appear in a different order than the bridi order, and that would be correct. Consider
**Example 16.27. **
ro | da | poi | prenu | ku'o | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X | which | is-a-person, |  | there-is-a-Y  
poi | gerku | ku'o | zo'u | de | batci | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
which | is-a-dog |  | : | Y | bites | X.  
  

The prenex of Example 16.27 is like that of Example 16.18 (but with relative clauses): it notes that the following bridi is true of every person with respect to some dog, not necessarily the same dog for each. But in the main bridi part, the __de__ appears before the __da__. Therefore, the true translation is
**Example 16.28. **
Every person is bitten by some dog (or other).
  

If we tried to omit the prenex and move the __ro__ and the relative clauses into the main bridi, we would get:
**Example 16.29. **
de | poi | gerku | cu | batci | ro | da | poi | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-a-Y | which | is-a-dog |  | which-bites | every | X | which | is-a-person  
Some dog bites everyone.  
---  
  

which has the structure of Example 16.19: it says that there is a dog (call him Fido) who bites, has bitten, or will bite every person that has ever existed! We can safely rule out Fido's existence, and say that Example 16.29 is false, while agreeing to Example 16.27.
Even so, Example 16.27 is most probably false, since some people never experience dogbite. Examples like Example 16.27 and Example 16.23 (might there be some dogs which never have breathed, because they died as embryos?) indicate the danger in Lojban of universal claims even when restricted. In English we are prone to say that “Everyone says” or that “Everybody does” or that “Everything is” when in fact there are obvious counterexamples which we are ignoring for the sake of making a rhetorical point. Such statements are plain falsehoods in Lojban, unless saved by a context (such as tense) which implicitly restricts them.
How can we express Example 16.27 in Lojban without a prenex? Since it is the order in which variables appear that matters, we can say:
**Example 16.30. **
ro | da | poi | prenu | cu | se | batci | de | poi | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Every | X | which | is-a-person |  |  | is-bitten-by | some-Y | which | is-a-dog.  
  

using the conversion operator __se__ (explained in Section 5.11) to change the selbri __batci__ (“bites”) into _se batci_ (“is bitten by”). The translation given in Example 16.28 uses the corresponding strategy in English, since English does not have prenexes (except in strained “logician's English”). This implies that a sentence with both a universal and an existential variable can't be freely converted with __se__ ; one must be careful to preserve the order of the variables.
If a variable occurs more than once, then any __ro__ or __poi__ decorations are moved only to the first occurrence of the variable when the prenex is dropped. For example,
**Example 16.31. **
di | poi | prenu | zo'u  
---|---|---|---  
There-is-a-Z | which | is-a-person | :  
ti | xarci | di | di  
---|---|---|---  
this-thing | is-a-weapon | for-use-against-Z | by-Z  
This is a weapon for someone to use against himself/herself.  
---  
  

(in which __di__ is used rather than __da__ just for variety) loses its prenex as follows:
**Example 16.32. **
ti | xarci | di | poi | prenu | ku'o | di  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | is-a-weapon-for-use-against | some-Z | which | is-a-person |  | by-Z.  
  

As the examples in this section show, dropping the prenex makes for terseness of expression often even greater than that of English (Lojban is meant to be an unambiguous language, not necessarily a terse or verbose one), provided the rules are observed.

## 16.11. Using _naku_ outside a prenex
Let us consider the English sentence
**Example 16.79. **
Some children do not go to school.
  

We cannot express this directly with __na__ ; the apparently obvious translation
**Example 16.80. **
su'oda | poi | verba  
---|---|---  
At-least-one-X | which-are | child(ren)  
na | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
[false] | go-to | at-least-one-Y | which-are | school(s).  
  

when converted to the external negation form produces:
**Example 16.81. **
naku | zo'u | su'oda | poi | verba | cu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-false | that | some-which | are | children |   
klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---  
go-to | some-which | are | schools.  
All children don't go to some school (not just some children).  
---  
  

Lojban provides a negation form which more closely emulates natural language negation. This involves putting _naku_ before the selbri, instead of a __na__. _naku_ is clearly a contradictory negation, given its parallel with prenex bridi negation. Using _naku_ , Example 16.79 can be expressed as:
**Example 16.82. **
su'oda | poi | verba | naku | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | which-are | children | don't | go-to | some | which-are | schools.  
Some children don't go to a school.  
---  
  

Although it is not technically a sumti, _naku_ can be used in most of the places where a sumti may appear. We'll see what this means in a moment.
When you use _naku_ within a bridi, you are explicitly creating a negation boundary. As explained in Section 16.9, when a prenex negation boundary expressed by _naku_ moves past a quantifier, the quantifier has to be inverted. The same is true for _naku_ in the bridi proper. We can move _naku_ to any place in the sentence where a sumti can go, inverting any quantifiers that the negation boundary crosses. Thus, the following are equivalent to Example 16.82 (no good English translations exist):
**Example 16.83. **
su'oda | poi | verba | cu | klama | rode | poi | ckule | naku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For some children, for every school, they don't go to it.  
---  
  

**Example 16.84. **
su'oda | poi | verba | cu | klama | naku | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some children don't go to (some) school(s).  
---  
  

**Example 16.85. **
naku | roda | poi | verba | cu | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is false that all children go to some school(s).  
---  
  

In Example 16.83, we moved the negation boundary rightward across the quantifier of __de__ , forcing us to invert it. In Example 16.85 we moved the negation boundary across the quantifier of __da__ , forcing us to invert it instead. Example 16.84 merely switched the selbri and the negation boundary, with no effect on the quantifiers.
The same rules apply if you rearrange the sentence so that the quantifier crosses an otherwise fixed negation. You can't just convert the selbri of Example 16.82 and rearrange the sumti to produce
**Example 16.86. **
su'ode | poi | ckule | ku'o | naku | se | klama | roda | poi | verba  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some schools aren't gone-to-by every child.  
---  
  

or rather, Example 16.86 means something completely different from Example 16.82. Conversion with __se__ under _naku_ negation is not symmetric; not all sumti are treated identically, and some sumti are not invariant under conversion. Thus, internal negation with _naku_ is considered an advanced technique, used to achieve stylistic compatibility with natural languages.
It isn't always easy to see which quantifiers have to be inverted in a sentence. Example 16.82 is identical in meaning to:
**Example 16.87. **
su'o | verba | naku | klama | su'o | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | children | don't | go-to | some | school.  
  

but in Example 16.87, the bound variables __da__ and __de__ have been hidden.
It is trivial to export an internal bridi negation expressed with __na__ to the prenex, as we saw in Section 16.9; you just move it to the left end of the prenex. In comparison, it is non-trivial to export a _naku_ to the prenex because of the quantifiers. The rules for exporting _naku_ require that you export all of the quantified variables (implicit or explicit) along with _naku_ , and you must export them from left to right, in the same order that they appear in the sentence. Thus Example 16.82 goes into prenex form as:
**Example 16.88. **
su'oda | poi | verba | ku'o | naku  
---|---|---|---|---  
For-some-X | which | is-a-child, |  | it-is-not-the-case-that  
su'ode | poi | ckule | zo'u | da | klama | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-is-a-Y | which | is-a-school | such-that: | X | goes | to | Y.  
  

We can now move the _naku_ to the left end of the prenex, getting a contradictory negation that can be expressed with __na__ :
**Example 16.89. **
naku | roda | poi | verba  
---|---|---|---  
It-is-not-the-case-that | for-all-X's | which-are | children,  
su'ode | poi | ckule | zo'u | da | klama | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-is-a-Y | which-is | a-school | such-that: | X | goes-to | Y.  
  

from which we can restore the quantified variables to the sentence, giving:
**Example 16.90. **
naku | zo'u | roda | poi | verba | cu | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is not the case that all children go to some school.  
---  
  

or more briefly
**Example 16.91. **
ro | verba | cu | na | klama | su'o | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | children |  | [false] | go-to | some | school(s).  
  

As noted in Section 16.5, a sentence with two different quantified variables, such as Example 16.91, cannot always be converted with __se__ without first exporting the quantified variables. When the variables have been exported, the sentence proper can be converted, but the quantifier order in the prenex must remain unchanged:
**Example 16.92. **
roda | poi | verba | su'ode  
---|---|---|---  
for-all-X's | which-are | children, | there-is-a-Y  
poi | ckule | zo'u | de | na | se | klama | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
which | is-a-school | such-that: | Y |  |  | is-gone-to-by | X.  
  

While you can't freely convert with __se__ when you have two quantified variables in a sentence, you can still freely move sumti to either side of the selbri, as long as the order isn't changed. If you use __na__ negation in such a sentence, nothing special need be done. If you use _naku_ negation, then quantified variables that cross the negation boundary must be inverted.
Clearly, if all of Lojban negation was built on _naku_ negation instead of __na__ negation, logical manipulation in Lojban would be as difficult as in natural languages. In Section 16.12, for example, we'll discuss DeMorgan's Law, which must be used whenever a sumti with a logical connection is moved across a negation boundary.
Since _naku_ has the grammar of a sumti, it can be placed almost anywhere a sumti can go, including __be__ and __bei__ clauses; it isn't clear what these mean, and we recommend avoiding such constructs.
You can put multiple _naku_ compounds in a sentence, each forming a separate negation boundary. Two adjacent _naku_ compounds in a bridi are a double negative and cancel out:
**Example 16.93. **
mi naku naku le zarci cu klama
  

Other expressions using two _naku_ compounds may or may not cancel out. If there is no quantified variable between them, then the _naku_ compounds cancel.
Negation with internal _naku_ is clumsy and non-intuitive for logical manipulations, but then, so are the natural language features it is emulating.

## 8.10. Relative clauses within relative clauses
For the most part, these are straightforward and uncomplicated: a sumti that is part of a relative clause bridi may itself be modified by a relative clause:
**Example 8.81. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | blanu | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | is-blue |  | is-slow.  
  

However, an ambiguity can exist if __ke'a__ is used in a relative clause within a relative clause: does it refer to the outermost sumti, or to the sumti within the outer relative clause to which the inner relative clause is attached? The latter. To refer to the former, use a subscript on __ke'a__ :
**Example 8.82. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'axire | zbasu | ke'a | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | IT-sub-2 | built | IT |  | is-slow.  
The person who is in the room which he built is slow.  
---  
  

Here, the meaning of “IT-sub-2” is that sumti attached to the second relative clause, counting from the innermost, is used. Therefore, _ke'axipa_ (IT-sub-1) means the same as plain __ke'a__.
Alternatively, you can use a prenex (explained in full in Chapter 16), which is syntactically a series of sumti followed by the special cmavo __zo'u__ , prefixed to the relative clause bridi:
**Example 8.83. **
le | prenu | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'a | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | who | (IT | = | it1 | :  
ko'a | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'e | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | is-in | the | room | which | (IT | = | it2 | :  
ko'a | zbasu | ko'e | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | built | it2) |  | is-slow.  
  

Example 8.83 is more verbose than Example 8.82, but may be clearer, since it explicitly spells out the two __ke'a__ cmavo, each on its own level, and assigns them to the assignable cmavo __ko'a__ and __ko'e__ (explained in Section 7.5).

## 8.3. Relative phrases
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
pe |  GOI |  restrictive association  
---|---|---  
po |  GOI |  restrictive possession  
po'e |  GOI |  restrictive intrinsic possession  
po'u |  GOI |  restrictive identification  
ne |  GOI |  incidental association  
no'u |  GOI |  incidental identification  
ge'u |  GEhU |  relative phrase terminator  
There are types of relative clauses (those which have a certain selbri) which are frequently wanted in Lojban, and can be expressed using a shortcut called a relative phrase. Relative phrases are introduced by cmavo of selma'o GOI, and consist of a GOI cmavo followed by a single sumti.
Here is an example of __pe__ , plus an equivalent sentence using a relative clause:
**Example 8.18. **
le | stizu | pe | mi | cu | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair | associated-with | me |  | is-blue.  
My chair is blue.  
---  
  

**Example 8.19. **
le | stizu | poi | ke'a | srana | mi | cu | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair | such-that-( | IT | is-associated-with | me | ) | is-blue.  
  

In Example 8.18 and Example 8.19, the link between the chair and the speaker is of the loosest kind.
Here is an example of __po__ :
**Example 8.20. **
le | stizu | po | mi | cu | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair | specific-to | me |  | is-red.  
  

**Example 8.21. **
le | stizu | poi | ke'a | se steci | srana | mi | cu | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair | such-that-( | IT | is-specifically | associated-with | me | ) | is-red.  
  

Example 8.20 and Example 8.21 contrast with Example 8.18 and Example 8.19: the chair is more permanently connected with the speaker. A plausible (though not the only possible) contrast between Example 8.18 and Example 8.20 is that _pe mi_ would be appropriate for a chair the speaker is currently sitting on (whether or not the speaker owned that chair), and _po mi_ for a chair owned by the speaker (whether or not he or she was currently occupying it).
As a result, the relationship expressed between two sumti by __po__ is usually called “possession”, although it does not necessarily imply ownership, legal or otherwise. The central concept is that of specificity (__steci__ in Lojban).
Here is an example of __po'e__ , as well as another example of __po__ :
**Example 8.22. **
le | birka | po'e | mi | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | arm | intrinsically-possessed-by | me |  | is-broken  
  

**Example 8.23. **
le | birka | poi | jinzi | ke | se steci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | arm | which | is-intrinsically | ( | specifically  
srana | mi | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---  
associated-with) | me |  | is-broken.  
  

**Example 8.24. **
le | botpi | po | mi | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | bottle | specific-to | me |  | is-broken  
  

Example 8.22 and Example 8.23 on the one hand, and Example 8.24 on the other, illustrate the contrast between two types of possession called “intrinsic” and “extrinsic”, or sometimes “inalienable” and “alienable”, respectively. Something is intrinsically (or inalienably) possessed by someone if the possession is part of the possessor, and cannot be changed without changing the possessor. In the case of Example 8.22, people are usually taken to intrinsically possess their arms: even if an arm is cut off, it remains the arm of that person. (If the arm is transplanted to another person, however, it becomes intrinsically possessed by the new user, though, so intrinsic possession is a matter of degree.)
By contrast, the bottle of Example 8.24 can be given away, or thrown away, or lost, or stolen, so it is possessed extrinsically (alienably). The exact line between intrinsic and extrinsic possession is culturally dependent. The U.S. Declaration of Independence speaks of the “inalienable rights” of men, but just what those rights are, and even whether the concept makes sense at all, varies from culture to culture.
Note that Example 8.22 can also be expressed without a relative clause:
**Example 8.25. **
le | birka | be | mi | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | arm | of-body | me |  | is-broken  
  

reflecting the fact that the gismu __birka__ has an x2 place representing the body to which the arm belongs. Many, but not all, cases of intrinsic possession can be thus covered without using __po'e__ by placing the possessor into the appropriate place of the description selbri.
Here is an example of __po'u__ :
**Example 8.26. **
le | gerku | po'u | le | mi | pendo | cu | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which-is |  | my | friend |  | kisses | me.  
  

**Example 8.27. **
le | gerku | poi | du | le | mi | pendo | cu | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which | = |  | my | friend |  | kisses | me.  
  

The cmavo __po'u__ does not represent possession at all, but rather identity. (Note that it means _poi du_ and its form was chosen to suggest the relationship.)
In Example 8.26, the use of __po'u__ tells us that _le gerku_ and _le mi pendo_ represent the same thing. Consider the contrast between Example 8.26 and:
**Example 8.28. **
le | mi | pendo | po'u | le | gerku | cu | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| My | friend | which-is | the | dog |  | kisses | me.  
  

The facts of the case are the same, but the listener's knowledge about the situation may not be. In Example 8.26, the listener is presumed not to understand which dog is meant by _le gerku_ , so the speaker adds a relative phrase clarifying that it is the particular dog which is the speaker's friend.
Example 8.28, however, assumes that the listener does not know which of the speaker's friends is referred to, and specifies that it is the friend that is the dog (which dog is taken to be obvious). Here is another example of the same contrast:
**Example 8.29. **
le | tcadu | po'u | la nu,iork  
---|---|---|---  
The city of New--York [not another city]  
---  
  

**Example 8.30. **
la nu,iork | po'u | le | tcadu  
---|---|---|---  
New--York -- the city (not the state or some other New York)  
---  
  

The principle that the possessor and the possessed may change places applies to all the GOI cmavo, and allows for the possibility of odd effects:
**Example 8.31. **
le | kabri | pe | le | mi | pendo | cu | cmalu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | cup | associated-with |  | my | friend |  | is-small.  
My friend's cup is small  
---  
  

**Example 8.32. **
le | mi | pendo | pe | le | kabri | cu | cmalu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| My | friend | associated-with | the | cup |  | is-small.  
My friend, the one with the cup, is small.  
---  
  

Example 8.31 is useful in a context which is about my friend, and states that his or her cup is small, whereas Example 8.32 is useful in a context that is primarily about a certain cup, and makes a claim about “my friend of the cup”, as opposed to some other friend of mine. Here the cup appears to “possess” the person! English can't even express this relationship with a possessive – “the cup's friend of mine” looks like nonsense – but Lojban has no trouble doing so.
Finally, the cmavo __ne__ and __no'u__ stand to __pe__ and __po'u__ , respectively, as __noi__ does to _poi-_ they provide incidental information:
**Example 8.33. **
le | blabi | gerku | ne | mi | cu | batci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | white | dog, | incidentally-associated-with | me | , | bites | you.  
The white dog, which is mine, bites you.  
---  
  

In Example 8.33, the white dog is already fully identified (after all, presumably the listener knows which dog bit him or her!). The fact that it is yours is merely incidental to the main bridi claim.
Distinguishing between __po'u__ and __no'u__ can be a little tricky. Consider a room with several men in it, one of whom is named Jim. If you don't know their names, I might say:
**Example 8.34. **
le | nanmu | no'u | la | djim. | cu | terpemci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man, | incidentally-who-is | that-named | Jim | , | is-a-poet.  
The man, Jim, is a poet.  
---  
  

Here I am saying that one of the men is a poet, and incidentally telling you that he is Jim. But if you do know the names, then
**Example 8.35. **
le | nanmu | po'u | la | djim. | cu | terpemci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | who-is | that-named | Jim |  | is-a-poet.  
The man Jim is a poet.  
---  
  

is appropriate. Now I am using the fact that the man I am speaking of is Jim in order to pick out which man I mean.
It is worth mentioning that English sometimes over-specifies possession from the Lojban point of view (and the point of view of many other languages, including ones closely related to English). The idiomatic English sentence
**Example 8.36. **
The man put his hands in his pockets.
  

seems strange to a French- or German-speaking person: whose pockets would he put his hands into? and even odder, whose hands would he put into his pockets? In Lojban, the sentence
**Example 8.37. **
le | nanmu | cu | punji | le | xance |  | le | daski  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man |  | puts | the | hand | at-locus | the | pocket.  
  

is very natural. Of course, if the man is in fact putting his hands into another's pockets, or another's hands into his pockets, the fact can be specified.
Finally, the elidable terminator for GOI cmavo is __ge'u__ of selma'o GEhU; it is almost never required. However, if a logical connective immediately follows a sumti modified by a relative phrase, then an explicit __ge'u__ is needed to allow the connective to affect the relativized sumti rather than the sumti of the relative phrase. (What about the cmavo after which selma'o GOI is named? It is discussed in Section 7.5, as it is not semantically akin to the other kinds of relative phrases, although the syntax is the same.)

## 5.2. Simple tanru
Beyond the single brivla, a selbri may consist of two brivla placed together. When a selbri is built in this way from more than one brivla, it is called a tanru, a word with no single English equivalent. The nearest analogue to tanru in English are combinations of two nouns such as “lemon tree”. There is no way to tell just by looking at the phrase “lemon tree” exactly what it refers to, even if you know the meanings of “lemon” and “tree” by themselves. As English-speakers, we must simply know that it refers to “a tree which bears lemons as fruits”. A person who didn't know English very well might think of it as analogous to “brown tree” and wonder, “What kind of tree is lemon-colored?”
In Lojban, tanru are also used for the same purposes as English adjective-noun combinations like “big boy” and adverb-verb combinations like “quickly run”. This is a consequence of Lojban not having any such categories as “noun”, “verb”, “adjective”, or “adverb”. English words belonging to any of these categories are translated by simple brivla in Lojban. Here are some examples of tanru:
**Example 5.6. **
tu | pelnimre | tricu  
---|---|---  
That-yonder | is-a-lemon | tree.  
That is a lemon tree.  
---  
  

**Example 5.7. **
la | djan. | barda | nanla  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | is-a-big | boy.  
John is a big boy.  
---  
  

**Example 5.8. **
mi | sutra | bajra  
---|---|---  
I | quick | run  
I quickly run./I run quickly.  
---  
  

Note that __pelnimre__ is a lujvo for “lemon”; it is derived from the gismu __pelxu__ , yellow, and __nimre__ , citrus. Note also that __sutra__ can mean “fast/quick” or “quickly” depending on its use:
**Example 5.9. **
mi | sutra  
---|---  
I | am-fast/quick  
  

shows __sutra__ used to translate an adjective, whereas in Example 5.8 it is translating an adverb. (Another correct translation of Example 5.8, however, would be “I am a quick runner”.)
There are special Lojban terms for the two components of a tanru, derived from the place structure of the word __tanru__. The first component is called the __seltau__ , and the second component is called the __tertau__.
The most important rule for use in interpreting tanru is that the tertau carries the primary meaning. A _pelnimre tricu_ is primarily a tree, and only secondarily is it connected with lemons in some way. For this reason, an alternative translation of Example 5.6 would be:
**Example 5.10. **
That is a lemon type of tree.
  

This “type of” relationship between the components of a tanru is fundamental to the tanru concept.
We may also say that the seltau modifies the meaning of the tertau:
**Example 5.11. **
That is a tree which is lemon-ish (in the way appropriate to trees)
  

would be another possible translation of Example 5.6. In the same way, a more explicit translation of Example 5.7 might be:
**Example 5.12. **
John is a boy who is big in the way that boys are big.
  

This “way that boys are big” would be quite different from the way in which elephants are big; big-for-a-boy is small-for-an-elephant.
All tanru are ambiguous semantically. Possible translations of:
**Example 5.13. **
ta | klama | jubme  
---|---|---  
That | is-a-goer | type-of-table.  
  

include:
  * That is a table which goes (a wheeled table, perhaps).
  * That is a table owned by one who goes.
  * That is a table used by those who go (a sports doctor's table?).
  * That is a table when it goes (otherwise it is a chair?).


In each case the object referred to is a “goer type of table”, but the ambiguous “type of” relationship can mean one of many things. A speaker who uses tanru (and pragmatically all speakers must) takes the risk of being misunderstood. Using tanru is convenient because they are short and expressive; the circumlocution required to squeeze out all ambiguity can require too much effort.
No general theory covering the meaning of all possible tanru exists; probably no such theory can exist. However, some regularities obviously do exist:
**Example 5.14. **
do | barda | prenu  
---|---|---  
You | are-a-large | person.  
  

**Example 5.15. **
do | cmalu | prenu  
---|---|---  
You | are-a-small | person.  
  

are parallel tanru, in the sense that the relationship between __barda__ and __prenu__ is the same as that between __cmalu__ and __prenu__. Section 5.14 and Section 5.15 contain a partial listing of some types of tanru, with examples.

## 5.3. Three-part tanru grouping with _bo_
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
bo |  BO |  closest scope grouping  
---|---|---  
Consider the English sentence:
**Example 5.16. **
That's a little girls' school.
  

What does it mean? Two possible readings are:
**Example 5.17. **
That's a little school for girls.
  

**Example 5.18. **
That's a school for little girls.
  

This ambiguity is quite different from the simple tanru ambiguity described in Section 5.2. We understand that “girls' school” means “a school where girls are the students”, and not “a school where girls are the teachers” or “a school which is a girl” (!). Likewise, we understand that “little girl” means “girl who is small”. This is an ambiguity of grouping. Is “girls' school” to be taken as a unit, with “little” specifying the type of girls' school? Or is “little girl” to be taken as a unit, specifying the type of school? In English speech, different tones of voice, or exaggerated speech rhythm showing the grouping, are used to make the distinction; English writing usually leaves it unrepresented.
Lojban makes no use of tones of voice for any purpose; explicit words are used to do the work. The cmavo __bo__ (which belongs to selma'o BO) may be placed between the two brivla which are most closely associated. Therefore, a Lojban translation of Example 5.17 would be:
**Example 5.19. **
ta | cmalu | nixli | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-small | girl | - | school.  
  

Example 5.18 might be translated:
**Example 5.20. **
ta | cmalu | bo | nixli | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-small | - | girl | school.  
  

The __bo__ is represented in the literal translation by a bracketed hyphen (not to be confused with the bare hyphen used as a placeholder in other glosses) because in written English a hyphen is sometimes used for the same purpose: “a big dog-catcher” would be quite different from a “big-dog catcher” (presumably someone who catches only big dogs).
Analysis of Example 5.19 and Example 5.20 reveals a tanru nested within a tanru. In Example 5.19, the main tanru has a seltau of __cmalu__ and a tertau of _nixli bo ckule_ ; the tertau is itself a tanru with __nixli__ as the seltau and __ckule__ as the tertau. In Example 5.20, on the other hand, the seltau is _cmalu bo nixli_ (itself a tanru), whereas the tertau is __ckule__. This structure of tanru nested within tanru forms the basis for all the more complex types of selbri that will be explained below.
What about Example 5.21? What does it mean?
**Example 5.21. **
ta | cmalu | nixli | ckule  
---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-small | girl | school.  
  

The rules of Lojban do not leave this sentence ambiguous, as the rules of English do with Example 5.16. The choice made by the language designers is to say that Example 5.21 means the same as Example 5.20. This is true no matter what three brivla are used: the leftmost two are always grouped together. This rule is called the “left-grouping rule”. Left-grouping in seemingly ambiguous structures is quite common – though not universal – in other contexts in Lojban.
Another way to express the English meaning of Example 5.19 and Example 5.20, using parentheses to mark grouping, is:
**Example 5.22. **
ta | cmalu |  | nixli | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-small | type-of | (girl | type-of | school).  
  

**Example 5.23. **
ta | cmalu | bo | nixli |  | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-(small | type-of | girl) | type-of | school.  
  

Because “type-of” is implicit in the Lojban tanru form, it has no Lojban equivalent.
Note: It is perfectly legal, though pointless, to insert __bo__ into a simple tanru:
**Example 5.24. **
ta | klama | bo | jubme  
---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-goer | - | table.  
  

is a legal Lojban bridi that means exactly the same thing as Example 5.13, and is ambiguous in exactly the same ways. The cmavo __bo__ serves only to resolve grouping ambiguity: it says nothing about the more basic ambiguity present in all tanru.

## 8.6. Relative clauses and descriptors
So far, this chapter has described the various kinds of relative clauses (including relative phrases). The list is now complete, and the rest of the chapter will be concerned with the syntax of sumti that include relative clauses. So far, all relative clauses have appeared directly after the sumti to which they are attached. This is the most common position (and originally the only one), but a variety of other placements are also possible which produce a variety of semantic effects.
There are actually three places where a relative clause can be attached to a description sumti: after the descriptor (__le__ , __lo__ , or whatever), after the embedded selbri but before the elidable terminator (which is __ku__), and after the __ku__. The relative clauses attached to descriptors that we have seen have occupied the second position. Thus Example 8.43, if written out with all elidable terminators, would appear as:
**Example 8.47. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | ku'o | ku | cu | klama | vau  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | (dog | which | (is-white | ) | ) |  | goes | .  
The dog which is white is going.  
---  
  

Here __ku'o__ is the terminator paired with __poi__ and __ku__ with __le__ , and __vau__ is the terminator of the whole bridi.
When a simple descriptor using __le__ , like _le gerku_ , has a relative clause attached, it is purely a matter of style and emphasis where the relative clause should go. Therefore, the following examples are all equivalent in meaning to Example 8.47:
**Example 8.48. **
le | poi | blabi | ku'o | gerku | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | such-that-( | it-is-white | ) | dog |  | goes.  
  

**Example 8.49. **
le | gerku | ku | poi | blabi | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | (dog | ) | which | is-white |  | goes.  
  

Example 8.47 will seem most natural to speakers of languages like English, which always puts relative clauses after the noun phrases they are attached to; Example 8.48, on the other hand, may seem more natural to Finnish or Chinese speakers, who put the relative clause first. Note that in Example 8.48, the elidable terminator __ku'o__ must appear, or the selbri of the relative clause (__blabi__) will merge with the selbri of the description (__gerku__), resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. The purpose of the form appearing in Example 8.49 will be apparent shortly.
As is explained in detail in Section 6.7, two different numbers (known as the “inner quantifier” and the “outer quantifier”) can be attached to a description. The inner quantifier specifies how many things the descriptor refers to: it appears between the descriptor and the description selbri. The outer quantifier appears before the descriptor, and specifies how many of the things referred to by the descriptor are involved in this particular bridi. In the following example,
**Example 8.50. **
re |  | le | mu | prenu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | of | the | five | persons |  | go-to | the | market.  
Two of the five people [that I have in mind] are going to the market.  
---  
  

__mu__ is the inner quantifier and __re__ is the outer quantifier. Now what is meant by attaching a relative clause to the sumti _re le mu prenu_? Suppose the relative clause is _poi ninmu_ (meaning “who are women”). Now the three possible attachment points discussed previously take on significance.
**Example 8.51. **
re |  | le | poi | ninmu | ku'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | of | the | such-that([they] | are-women | )  
mu | prenu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
five | persons |  | go-to | the | market.  
Two women out of the five persons go to the market.  
---  
  

**Example 8.52. **
re |  | le | mu | prenu | poi | ninmu | [ku] | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | of | the | (five | persons | which-( | are-women) | ) |  | go-to | the | market.  
Two of the five women go to the market.  
---  
  

**Example 8.53. **
re |  | le | mu | prenu | ku | poi | ninmu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(Two | of | the | five | persons | ) | which-( | are-women | ) | go-to | the | market.  
Two women out of the five persons go to the market.  
---  
  

As the parentheses show, Example 8.52 means that all five of the persons are women, whereas Example 8.53 means that the two who are going to the market are women. How do we remember which is which? If the relative clause comes after the explicit __ku__ , as in Example 8.53, then the sumti as a whole is qualified by the relative clause. If there is no __ku__ , or if the relative clause comes before an explicit __ku__ , then the relative clause is understood to apply to everything which the underlying selbri applies to.
What about Example 8.51? By convention, it means the same as Example 8.53, and it requires no __ku__ , but it does typically require a __ku'o__ instead. Note that the relative clause comes before the inner quantifier.
When __le__ is the descriptor being used, and the sumti has no explicit outer quantifier, then the outer quantifier is understood to be __ro__ (meaning “all”), as is explained in Section 6.7. Thus _le gerku_ is taken to mean “all of the things I refer to as dogs”, possibly all one of them. In that case, there is no difference between a relative clause after the __ku__ or before it. However, if the descriptor is __lo__ , the difference is quite important:
**Example 8.54. **
lo | prenu | ku | noi | blabi | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(Some | persons | ) | incidentally-which-( | are-white | ) | go-to | the | market.  
Some people, who are white, go to the market.  
---  
  

**Example 8.55. **
lo | prenu | noi | blabi | [ku] | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | (persons | incidentally-which | are-white | ) |  | go | to-the | market.  
Some of the people, who by the way are white, go to the market.  
---  
  

Both Example 8.54 and Example 8.55 tell us that one or more persons are going to the market. However, they make very different incidental claims. Now, what does _lo prenu noi blabi_ mean? Well, the default inner quantifier is __ro__ (meaning “all”), and the default outer quantifier is __su'o__ (meaning “at least one”). Therefore, we must first take all persons, then choose at least one of them. That one or more people will be going.
In Example 8.54, the relative clause described the sumti once the outer quantifier was applied: one or more people, who are white, are going. But in Example 8.55, the relative clause actually describes the sumti before the outer quantification is applied, so that it ends up meaning “First take all persons – by the way, they're all white”. But not all people are white, so the incidental claim being made here is false.
The safe strategy, therefore, is to always use __ku__ when attaching a __noi__ relative clause to a __lo__ descriptor. Otherwise we may end up claiming far too much.
When the descriptor is __la__ , indicating that what follows is a selbri used for naming, then the positioning of relative clauses has a different significance. A relative clause inside the __ku__ , whether before or after the selbri, is reckoned part of the name; a relative clause outside the __ku__ is not. Therefore,
**Example 8.56. **
mi | viska | la | nanmu | poi | terpa | le | ke'a | xirma | [ku]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | that-named-( | man | which | fears | the | of-IT | horse | ).  
I see Man Afraid Of His Horse.  
---  
  

says that the speaker sees a person with a particular name, who does not necessarily fear any horses, whereas
**Example 8.57. **
mi | viska | la | nanmu | ku | poi | terpa | le | ke'a | xirma.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | that-named-( | Man | ) | which | fears | the | of-IT | horse.  
I see the person named “Man” who is afraid of his horse.  
---  
  

refers to one (or more) of those named “Man”, namely the one(s) who are afraid of their horses.
Finally, so-called indefinite sumti like _re karce_ , which means almost the same as _re lo karce_ (which in turn means the same as _re lo ro karce_), can have relative clauses attached; these are taken to be of the outside-the- __ku__ variety. Here is an example:
**Example 8.58. **
mi | ponse | re | karce | [ku] | poi | xekri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | two | cars |  | which-are | black.  
  

The restrictive relative clause only affects the two cars being affected by the main bridi, not all cars that exist. It is ungrammatical to try to place a relative clause within an indefinite sumti (that is, before an explicitly expressed terminating __ku__.) Use an explicit __lo__ instead.

## 9.9. Modal selbri
Consider the example:
**Example 9.55. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban  
bai | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
with-compeller | some-act-by | that-named | Frank.  
I speak in Lojban, under compulsion by Frank.  
---  
  

Example 9.55 has two modal sumti, using the modals __bau__ and __bai__. Suppose we wanted to specify the language explicitly but be vague about who's doing the compelling. We can simplify Example 9.55 to:
**Example 9.56. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban. | bai | [ku].  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban | under-compulsion |   
  

In Example 9.56, the elidable terminator __ku__ has taken the place of the sumti which would normally follow __bai__. Alternatively, we could specify the one who compels but keep the language vague:
**Example 9.57. **
mi | tavla | bau | [ku]  
---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-some-language |   
bai | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
under-compulsion-by | some-act-by | that-named | Frank.  
  

We are also free to move the modal-plus- __ku__ around the bridi:
**Example 9.58. **
bau | [ku] | bai | ku | mi | tavla  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
In-some-language |  | under-compulsion |  | I | speak.  
  

An alternative to using __ku__ is to place the modal cmavo right before the selbri, following the __cu__ which often appears there. When a modal is present, the __cu__ is almost never necessary.
**Example 9.59. **
mi | bai | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | compelledly | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

In this use, the modal is like a tanru modifier semantically, although grammatically it is quite distinct. Example 9.59 is very similar in meaning to:
**Example 9.60. **
mi | se bapli | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | compelledly | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

The __se__ conversion is needed because _bapli tavla_ would be a “compeller type of speaker” rather than a “compelled (by someone) type of speaker”, which is what a _bai tavla_ is.
If the modal preceding a selbri is constructed using __fi'o__ , then __fe'u__ is required to prevent the main selbri and the modal selbri from colliding:
**Example 9.61. **
mi | fi'o | kanla | fe'u | viska | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | with | eye |  | see | you.  
I see you with my eye(s).  
---  
  

There are two other uses of modals. A modal can be attached to a pair of bridi-tails that have already been connected by a logical, non-logical, or modal connection (see Chapter 14 for more on logical and non-logical connections):
**Example 9.62. **
mi | bai | ke | ge | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | under-compulsion | ( | both | go | to-the | market  
gi | cadzu | le | bisli | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk | on-the | ice | ).  
Under compulsion, I both go to the market and walk on the ice.  
---  
  

Here the __bai__ is spread over both _klama le zarci_ and _cadzu le bisli_ , and the _ge ... gi_ represents the logical connection “both-and” between the two.
Similarly, a modal can be attached to multiple sentences that have been combined with __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ , which are explained in more detail in Section 19.2:
**Example 9.63. **
bai | tu'e | mi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Under-compulsion | [start] | I | go | to-the | market.  
.i | mi | cadzu | le | bisli | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| I | walk | on-the | ice | [end].  
  

means the same thing as Example 9.62.
Note: Either BAI modals or _fi'o-_ plus-selbri modals may correctly be used in any of the constructions discussed in this section.

## 9.12. Modal conversion: JAI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
jai |  JAI |  modal conversion  
---|---|---  
fai |  FA |  modal place structure tag  
So far, conversion of numbered bridi places with SE and the addition of modal places with BAI have been two entirely separate operations. However, it is possible to convert a selbri in such a way that, rather than exchanging two numbered places, a modal place is made into a numbered place. For example,
**Example 9.82. **
mi | cusku |  | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | [something] | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

has an explicit x1 place occupied by __mi__ and an explicit __bau__ place occupied by _la lojban._ To exchange these two, we use a modal conversion operator consisting of __jai__ (of selma'o JAI) followed by the modal cmavo. Thus, the modal conversion of Example 9.82 is:
**Example 9.83. **
la | lojban. | jai bau cusku | fai | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Lojban | is-the-language-of-expression | used-by | me.  
  

In Example 9.83, the modal place _la lojban._ has become the x1 place of the new selbri _jai bau cusku_. What has happened to the old x1 place? There is no numbered place for it to move to, so it moves to a special “unnumbered place” marked by the tag __fai__ of selma'o FA.
Note: For the purposes of place numbering, __fai__ behaves like __fi'a__ ; it does not affect the numbering of the other places around it.
Like SE conversions, JAI conversions are especially convenient in descriptions. We may refer to “the language of an expression” as _le jai bau cusku_ , for example.
In addition, it is grammatical to use __jai__ without a following modal. This usage is not related to modals, but is explained here for completeness. The effect of __jai__ by itself is to send the x1 place, which should be an abstraction, into the __fai__ position, and to raise one of the sumti from the abstract sub-bridi into the x1 place of the main bridi. This feature is discussed in more detail in Section 11.10. The following two examples mean the same thing:
**Example 9.84. **
le | nu | mi | lebna | le | cukta | cu | se krinu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | (I | take | the | book) |  | is-justified-by  
le | nu | mi | viska | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | (I | see | the | book).  
My taking the book is justified by my seeing it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.85. **
mi | jai se krinu | le | nu | mi | viska | le | cukta | kei  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-justified-by | the | event-of | (I | see | the | book) |   
[fai | le | nu | mi | lebna | le | cukta]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[namely, | the | event-of | (I | take | the | book)]  
I am justified in taking the book by seeing the book.  
---  
  

Example 9.85, with the bracketed part omitted, allows us to say that “I am justified” whereas in fact it is my action that is justified. This construction is vague, but useful in representing natural-language methods of expression.
Note: The uses of modals discussed in this section are applicable both to BAI modals and to _fi'o-_ plus-selbri modals.

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  
I'm worn out by your continuous talking.  
---  
  

**Example 13.27. **
.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  
I'm putting you to bed.  
---  
  

**Example 13.28. **
.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.  
---  
  

**Example 13.29. **
.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  
I hope I feel better tomorrow!  
---  
  

**Example 13.30. **
.au | mi | sipna  
---|---|---  
[desire] | I | sleep.  
I want to sleep.  
---  
  

**Example 13.31. **
.a'ucu'i | do | pante  
---|---|---  
[no-interest] | you | complain.  
I have no interest in your complaints.  
---  
  

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  
I feel up to dealing with you.  
---  
  

**Example 13.34. **
.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  
I should fill the car's gas tank.  
---  
  

**Example 13.35. **
.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  
---|---|---|---  
[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  
Please take care of yourself!  
---  
  

**Example 13.36. **
.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  
I suggest going to the park.  
---  
  

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  
I can't believe you thought you could fool me.  
---  
  

**Example 13.38. **
do | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  
I blame you for not coming home.  
---  
  

**Example 13.39. **
.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  
le | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  
It's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  
---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  
---

## 8.4. Multiple relative clauses: _zi'e_
zi'e |  ZIhE |  relative clause joiner  
---|---|---  
Sometimes it is necessary or useful to attach more than one relative clause to a sumti. This is made possible in Lojban by the cmavo __zi'e__ (of selma'o ZIhE), which is used to join one or more relative clauses together into a single unit, thus making them apply to the same sumti. For example:
**Example 8.38. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | zi'e | poi | batci | le | nanmu | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The dog which is white and which bites the man goes.  
---  
  

The most usual translation of __zi'e__ in English is “and”, but __zi'e__ is not really a logical connective: unlike most of the true logical connectives (which are explained in Chapter 14), it cannot be converted into a logical connection between sentences.
It is perfectly correct to use __zi'e__ to connect relative clauses of different kinds:
**Example 8.39. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | zi'e | noi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | that-is | (white) | and | incidentally-such-that  
le | mi | pendo | cu | ponse | ke'a | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(- | my | friend |  | owns | IT | ) | goes.  
The dog that is white, which my friend owns, is going.  
---  
  

In Example 8.39, the restrictive clause _poi blabi_ specifies which dog is referred to, but the incidental clause _noi le mi pendo cu ponse_ is mere incidental information: the listener is supposed to already have identified the dog from the _poi blabi_. Of course, the meaning (though not necessarily the emphasis) is the same if the incidental clause appears first.
It is also possible to connect relative phrases with __zi'e__ , or a relative phrase with a relative clause:
**Example 8.40. **
le | botpi | po | mi | zi'e | poi | blanu | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | bottle | specific-to | me | and | which-is | blue |  | is-broken.  
My blue bottle is broken.  
---  
  

Note that if the colloquial translation of Example 8.40 were “My bottle, which is blue, is broken”, then __noi__ rather than __poi__ would have been correct in the Lojban version, since that version of the English implies that you do not need to know the bottle is blue. As written, Example 8.40 suggests that I probably have more than one bottle, and the one in question needs to be picked out as the blue one.
**Example 8.41. **
mi | ba | zutse | le | stizu | pe  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | sit-in | the | chair | associated-with  
mi | zi'e | po | do | zi'e | poi | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
me | and | specific-to | you | and | which | is-red.  
I will sit in my chair (really yours), the red one.  
---  
  

Example 8.41 illustrates that more than two relative phrases or clauses can be connected with __zi'e__. It almost defies colloquial translation because of the very un-English contrast between _pe mi_ , implying that the chair is temporarily connected with me, and _po do_ , implying that the chair has a more permanent association with you. (Perhaps I am a guest in your house, in which case the chair would naturally be your property.)
Here is another example, mixing a relative phrase and two relative clauses, a restrictive one and a non-restrictive one:
**Example 8.42. **
mi | ba | citka | le | dembi | pe | mi | zi'e | poi | cpana  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | eat | the | beans | associated-with | me | and | which | are-upon  
le | mi | palta | zi'e | noi | do | dunda | ke'a |  | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| my | plate | and | which-incidentally | you | gave | IT | to | me.  
I'll eat my beans that are on my plate, the ones you gave me.  
---

The dog that is white, which my friend owns, is going.

In Example 8.39, the restrictive clause _poi blabi_ specifies which dog is referred to, but the incidental clause _noi le mi pendo cu ponse_ is mere incidental information: the listener is supposed to already have identified the dog from the _poi blabi_. Of course, the meaning (though not necessarily the emphasis) is the same if the incidental clause appears first.
It is also possible to connect relative phrases with __zi'e__ , or a relative phrase with a relative clause:
