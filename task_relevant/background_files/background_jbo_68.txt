## 13.16. Tentative conclusion
The exact ramifications of the indicator system in actual usage are unknown. There has never been anything like it in natural language before. The system provides great potential for emotional expression and transcription, from which significant Sapir-Whorf effects can be anticipated. When communicating across cultural boundaries, where different indicators are often used for the same emotion, accidental offense can be avoided. If we ever ran into an alien race, a culturally neutral language of emotion could be vital. (A classic example, taken from the science fiction of Larry Niven, is to imagine speaking Lojban to the carnivorous warriors called Kzinti, noting that a human smile bares the teeth, and could be seen as an intent to attack.) And for communicating emotions to computers, when we cannot identify all of the signals involved in subliminal human communication (things like body language are also cultural), a system like this is needed.
We have tried to err on the side of overkill. There are distinctions possible in this system that no one may care to make in any culture. But it was deemed more neutral to overspecify and let usage decide, than to choose a limited set and constrain emotional expression. For circumstances in which even the current indicator set is not enough, it is possible using the cmavo __sei__ , explained in Section 19.12, to create metalinguistic comments that act like indicators.
We envision an evolutionary development. At this point, the system is little more than a mental toy. Many of you who read this will try playing around with various combinations of indicators, trying to figure out what emotions they express and when the expressions might be useful. You may even find an expression for which there currently is no good English word and start using it. Why not, if it helps you express your feelings?
There will be a couple dozen of these used pretty much universally – mostly just simple attitudinals with, at most, intensity markers. These are the ones that will quickly be expressed at the subconscious level. But every Lojbanist who plays with the list will bring in a couple of new words. Poets will paint emotional pictures, and people who identify with those pictures will use the words so created for their own experiences.
Just as a library of tanru is built up, so will a library of attitudes be built. Unlike the tanru, though, the emotional expressions are built on some fairly nebulous root emotions – words that cannot be defined with the precision of the gismu. The emotion words of Lojban will very quickly take on a life of their own, and the outline given here will evolve into a true system of emotions.
There are several theories as to the nature of emotion, and they change from year to year as we learn more about ourselves. Whether or not Lojban's additive/scalar emotional model is an accurate model for human emotions, it does support the linguistic needs for expressing those emotions. Researchers may learn more about the nature of human emotions by exploring the use of the system by Lojban speakers. They also may be able to use the Lojban system as a means for more clearly recording emotions.
The full list of scales and attitudes will probably not be used until someone speaks the language from birth. Until then, people will use the attitudes that are important to them. In this way, we counter cultural bias – if a culture is prone to recognizing and/or expressing certain emotions more than others, its members will use only those out of the enormous set available. If a culture hides certain emotions, its members simply won't express them.
Perhaps native Lojban speakers will be more expressively clear about their emotions than others. Perhaps they will feel some emotions more strongly than others in ways that can be correlated with the word choices; any difference from the norms of other cultures could be significant. Psychologists have devised elaborate tests for measuring attitudes and personality; this may be the easiest area in which to detect any systematic cultural effect of the type sought to confirm Sapir-Whorf, simply because we already have tools in existence to test it. Because Lojban is unique among languages in having such extensive and expressive indicators, it is likely that a Sapir-Whorf effect will occur and will be recognized.
It is unlikely that we will know the true potential of a system like this one until and unless we have children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking environment. We learn too many cultural habits in the realm of emotional communication “at our mother's knee”. Such children will have a Lojban system that has stronger reinforcement than any typical culture system. The second generation of such children, then, could be said to be the start of a true Lojbanic culture.
We shouldn't need to wait that long to detect significant effects. Emotion is so basic to our lives that even a small change or improvement in emotional communication would have immediately noticeable effects. Perhaps it will be the case that the most important contribution of our “logical language” will be in the non-logical realm of emotion!

## 7.15. lujvo based on pro-sumti
There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See Section 7.16 for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.
Thus __donta'a__ , meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted as _tavla be do_ , and would have the place structure
**Example 7.76. **
> t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
  

since `t2` (the addressee) is already known to be __do__.
On the other hand, the lujvo __donma'o__ , literally “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal pronoun”, would be interpreted as _cmavo be zo do_ , and have the place structure:
**Example 7.77. **
> c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
  

since both the `c2` place (the grammatical class) and the `c3` place (the meaning) are obvious from the context __do__.
An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the __fo'a__ series is to express lujvo which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An example would be:
**Example 7.78. **
fo'a | goi | le | kulnrsu,omi | .i | lo | fo'arselsanga  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x6 | stands-for | the | Finnish-culture | . | An | x6-song.  
  

Finally, lujvo involving __zi'o__ are also possible, and are fully discussed in Chapter 12. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for __zi'o__ as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a _se pinxe be zi'o_ , the lujvo corresponding to this is _zilrelselpinxe_ (deleting the second place of _se pinxe_). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that _zilpavypinxe_ has the same place structure as _zilrelselpinxe_ , and _lo zilpavypinxe_ , like _lo zilrelselpinxe_ , refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ , __du__ , and __bu'a__ also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for _du-_ based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.

## 2.16. Indicators
Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. “Aha!”, “Oh no!”, “Ouch!”, “Aahh!”, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.
Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left. For example:
**Example 2.79. **
.ie |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Agreement! |  I |  - |  go.  
Yep! I'll go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.80. **
.ei |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Obligation! |  I |  - |  go.  
I should go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.81. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  le melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go |  to-the beautiful-thing  
.ui |  [ku]  
---|---  
and I am happy because it is the beautiful thing I'm going to |  -  
  

Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison, the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means “and”.
**Example 2.82. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  You |  - |  stay.  
  

**Example 2.83. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ji'a |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  In addition, |  you |  - |  stay. |  added weight  
  

**Example 2.84. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ku'i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  However, |  you |  - |  stay. |  contrast  
  

Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”. Evidentials show the speaker's relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include __za'a__ (I directly observe the relationship), __pe'i__ (I believe that the relationship holds), __ru'a__ (I postulate the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.
**Example 2.85. **
pe'i |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I opine! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.  
  

**Example 2.86. **
za'a |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I directly observe! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.

## 2.11. Examples of brivla
The simplest form of selbri is an individual word. A word which may by itself express a selbri relation is called a __brivla__. The three types of brivla are gismu (root words), lujvo (compounds), and fu'ivla (borrowings from other languages). All have identical grammatical uses. So far, most of our selbri have been gismu or tanru built from gismu.
gismu:
**Example 2.46. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  ti |  zo'e |  zo'e |  ta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go-er |  - |  goes |  destination |  origin |  route |  means.  
I go here (to this) using that means (from somewhere via some route).  
---  
  

lujvo:
**Example 2.47. **
ta |  [cu] |  blari'o  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  is-blue-green.  
  

fu'ivla:
**Example 2.48. **
ti |  [cu] |  djarspageti  
---|---|---  
This |  - |  is-spaghetti.  
  

Some cmavo may also serve as selbri, acting as variables that stand for another selbri. The most commonly used of these is __go'i__ , which represents the main bridi of the previous Lojban sentence, with any new sumti or other sentence features being expressed replacing the previously expressed ones. Thus, in this context:
**Example 2.49. **
ta |  [cu] |  go'i  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  too/same-as-last selbri.  
That (is spaghetti), too.  
---

## 17.12. Acronyms
An acronym is a name constructed of lerfu. English examples are “DNA”, “NATO”, “CIA”. In English, some of these are spelled out (like “DNA” and “CIA”) and others are pronounced more or less as if they were ordinary English words (like “NATO”). Some acronyms fluctuate between the two pronunciations: “SQL” may be “ess cue ell” or “sequel”.
In Lojban, a name can be almost any sequence of sounds that ends in a consonant and is followed by a pause. The easiest way to Lojbanize acronym names is to glue the lerfu words together, using _'_ wherever two vowels would come together (pauses are illegal in names) and adding a final consonant:
**Example 17.40. **
la dyny'abub. .i la ny'abuty'obub. .i la cy'ibu'abub.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulyl. .i la .ibubymym. .i la ny'ybucyc.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

There is no fixed convention for assigning the final consonant. In Example 17.40, the last consonant of the lerfu string has been replicated into final position.
Some compression can be done by leaving out __bu__ after vowel lerfu words (except for __.y.bu__ , wherein the __bu__ cannot be omitted without ambiguity). Compression is moderately important because it's hard to say long names without introducing an involuntary (and illegal) pause:
**Example 17.41. **
la dyny'am. .i la ny'aty'om. .i la cy'i'am.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulym. .i la .ibymym. .i la ny'ybucym.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

In Example 17.41, the final consonant _m_ stands for __merko__ , indicating the source culture of these acronyms.
Another approach, which some may find easier to say and which is compatible with older versions of the language that did not have a _'_ character, is to use the consonant _z_ instead of _'_ :
**Example 17.42. **
la dynyzaz. .i la nyzatyzoz. .i la cyzizaz.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulyz. .i la .ibymyz. .i la nyzybucyz.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

One more alternative to these lengthy names is to use the lerfu string itself prefixed with __me__ , the cmavo that makes sumti into selbri:
**Example 17.43. **
la | me | dy | ny. | .abu  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | what-pertains-to |  “d” |  “n” |  “a”  
  

This works because __la__ , the cmavo that normally introduces names used as sumti, may also be used before a predicate to indicate that the predicate is a (meaningful) name:
**Example 17.44. **
la | cribe | cu | ciska  
---|---|---|---  
That-named |  “Bear” |  | writes.  
Bear is a writer.  
---  
  

Example 17.44 does not of course refer to a bear (_le cribe_ or _lo cribe_) but to something else, probably a person, named “Bear”. Similarly, _me dy ny. .abu_ is a predicate which can be used as a name, producing a kind of acronym which can have pauses between the individual lerfu words.

## 14.14. Non-logical connectives
Way back in Section 14.1, the point was made that not every use of English “and”, “if ... then”, and so on represents a Lojban logical connective. In particular, consider the “and” of:
**Example 14.109. **
John and Alice carried the piano.
  

Given the nature of pianos, this probably means that John carried one end and Alice the other. So it is not true that:
**Example 14.110. **
John carried the piano, and Alice carried the piano.
  

which would mean that each of them carried the piano by himself/herself. Lojban deals with this particular linguistic phenomenon as a “mass”. John and Alice are joined together into a mass, John-and-Alice, and it is this mass which carried the piano, not either of them separately. The cmavo __joi__ (of selma'o JOI) is used to join two or more components into a mass:
**Example 14.111. **
la | djan. | joi | la | .alis. | cu | bevri | le | pipno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | massed-with | that-named | Alice |  | carry | the | piano.  
  

Example 14.111 covers the case mentioned, where John and Alice divide the labor; it also could mean that John did all the hauling and Alice did the supervising. This possibility arises because the properties of a mass are the properties of its components, which can lead to apparent contradictions: if John is small and Alice is large, then John-and-Alice is both small and large. Masses are also discussed in Section 6.3.
Grammatically, __joi__ can appear between two sumti (like an ek) or between two tanru components (like a jek). This flexibility must be paid for in the form of occasional terminators that cannot be elided:
**Example 14.112. **
le | nanmu | ku | joi | le | ninmu | [ku] | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man |  | massed-with | the | woman |  |  | go-to | the | market.  
  

The cmavo __ku__ is the elidable terminator for __le__ , which can almost always be elided, but not in this case. If the first __ku__ were elided here, Lojban's parsing rules would see _le nanmu joi_ and assume that another tanru component is to follow; since the second __le__ cannot be part of a tanru, a parsing error results. No such problem can occur with logical connectives, because an ek signals a following sumti and a jek a following tanru component unambiguously.
Single or compound cmavo involving members of selma'o JOI are called joiks, by analogy with the names for logical connectives. It is not grammatical to use joiks to connect bridi-tails.
In tanru, __joi__ has the connotation “mixed with”, as in the following example:
**Example 14.113. **
ti | blanu | joi | xunre | bolci  
---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-(blue | mixed-with | red) | ball.  
This is a blue and red ball.  
---  
  

Here the ball is neither wholly blue nor wholly red, but partly blue and partly red. Its blue/redness is a mass property. (Just how blue something has to be to count as “wholly blue” is an unsettled question, though. A _blanu zdani_ may be so even though not every part of it is blue.)
There are several other cmavo in selma'o JOI which can be used in the same grammatical constructions. Not all of them are well-defined as yet in all contexts. All have clear definitions as sumti connectives; those definitions are shown in the following table:
A __joi__ B | the mass with components A and B  
---|---  
A __ce__ B | the set with elements A and B  
A __ce'o__ B | the sequence with elements A and B in order  
A __se__ __ce'o__ B | the sequence with elements B and A in order  
A __jo'u__ B | A and B considered jointly  
A __fa'u__ B | A and B respectively  
A __se__ __fa'u__ B | B and A respectively  
A __jo'e__ B | the union of sets A and B  
A __ku'a__ B | the intersection of sets A and B  
A __pi'u__ B | the cross product of sets A and B  
A __se__ __pi'u__ B | the cross product of sets B and A  
The cmavo __se__ is grammatical before any JOI cmavo, but only useful with those that have inherent order. Here are some examples of joiks:
**Example 14.114. **
mi | cuxna | la | .alis. | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | choose | that-named | Alice | from-that-named | Frank  
ce | la | .alis. | ce | la | djeimyz.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and-member | that-named | Alice | and-member | that-named | James.  
I choose Alice from among Frank, Alice, and James.  
---  
  

The x3 place of __cuxna__ is a set from which the choice is being made. A set is an abstract object which is determined by specifying its members. Unlike those of a mass, the properties of a set are unrelated to its members' properties: the set of all rats is large (since many rats exist), but the rats themselves are small. This chapter does not attempt to explain set theory (the mathematical study of sets) in detail: explaining propositional logic is quite enough for one chapter!
In Example 14.114 we specify that set by listing the members with __ce__ joining them.
**Example 14.115. **
ti | liste | mi | ce'o | do | ce'o | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-list-of | me | and-sequence | you | and-sequence | that-named | John.  
This is a list of you, me, and John.  
---  
  

The x2 place of __liste__ is a sequence of the things which are mentioned in the list. (It is worth pointing out that _lo liste_ means a physical object such as a grocery list: a purely abstract list is _lo porsi_ , a sequence.) Here the three sumti connected by __ce'o__ are in a definite order, not just lumped together in a set or a mass.
So __joi__ , __ce__ , and __ce'o__ are parallel, in that the sumti connected are taken to be individuals, and the result is something else: a mass, a set, or a sequence respectively. The cmavo __jo'u__ serves as a fourth element in this pattern: the sumti connected are individuals, and the result is still individuals – but inseparably so. The normal Lojban way of saying that James and George are brothers is:
**Example 14.116. **
la | djeimyz. | bruna | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | is-the-brother-of | that-named | George.  
  

possibly adding a discursive element meaning “and vice versa”. However, “James and George are brothers” cannot be correctly translated as:
**Example 14.117. **
la | djeimyz. | .e | la | djordj. | bruna  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and | that-named | George | is-a-brother.  
  

since that expands to two bridi and means that James is a brother and so is George, but not necessarily of each other. If the __e__ is changed to __jo'u__ , however, the meaning of Example 14.116 is preserved:
**Example 14.118. **
la | djeimyz. | jo'u  
---|---|---  
That-named | James | in-common-with | that-named  
la | djordj. | cu | remei | bruna  
---|---|---|---|---  
George |  | are-a-twosome | type-of-brothers.  
  

The tanru _remei bruna_ is not strictly necessary in this sentence, but is used to make clear that we are not saying that James and George are both brothers of some third person not specified. Alternatively, we could turn the tanru around: the x1 place of __re__ __mei__ is a mass with two components, leading to:
**Example 14.119. **
la | djeimyz. | joi  
---|---|---  
That-named | James | massed-with  
la | djordj. | cu | bruna | remei  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George |  | are-a-brother | type-of-twosome.  
  

where __joi__ is used to create the necessary mass.
Likewise, __fa'u__ can be used to put two individuals together where order matters. Typically, there will be another __fa'u__ somewhere else in the same bridi:
**Example 14.120. **
la | djeimyz. | fa'u | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | jointly-in-order-with | that-named | George  
prami | la | meris. | fa'u | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
loves | that-named | Mary | jointly-in-order-with | that-named | Martha.  
James and George love Mary and Martha, respectively.  
---  
  

Here the information carried by the English adverb “respectively”, namely that James loves Mary and George loves Martha, is divided between the two occurrences of __fa'u__. If both uses of __fa'u__ were to be changed to __e__ , we would get:
**Example 14.121. **
la | djeimyz. | .e | la | djordj. | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and | that-named | George | love  
la | meris. | .e | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Mary | and | that-named | Martha.  
  

which can be transformed to four bridi:
**Example 14.122. **
la | djeimyz. | prami | la | meris. | .ije | la | djordj. | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | loves | that-named | Mary, | and | that-named | George | loves  
la | meris. | .ije | la | djeimyz. | prami | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Mary, | and | that-named | James | loves | that-named | Martha,  
.ije | la | djordj. | prami | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | that-named | George | loves | that-named | Martha.  
  

which represents quite a different state of affairs from Example 14.120. The meaning of Example 14.120 can also be conveyed by a termset:
**Example 14.123. **
la | djeimyz. | ce'e | la | meris. | pe'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | [plus] | that-named | Mary | [joint]  
.e | la | djordj. | ce'e | la | martas. | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | that-named | George | [plus] | that-named | Martha | loves.  
  

at the expense of re-ordering the list of names so as to make the pairs explicit. This option is not available when one of the lists is only described rather than enumerated:
**Example 14.124. **
la | djeimyz. | fa'u | la | djordj. | prami | re | mensi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and-respectively | that-named | George | love | two | sisters.  
  

which conveys that James loves one sister and George the other, though we are not able to tell which of the sisters is which.

## 9.4. Conversion: SE
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
se |  SE |  2nd place conversion  
---|---|---  
te |  SE |  3rd place conversion  
ve |  SE |  4th place conversion  
xe |  SE |  5th place conversion  
So far we have seen ways to move sumti around within a bridi, but the actual place structure of the selbri has always remained untouched. The conversion cmavo of selma'o SE are incorporated within the selbri itself, and produce a new selbri (called a converted selbri) with a different place structure. In particular, after the application of any SE cmavo, the number and purposes of the places remain the same, but two of them have been exchanged, the x1 place and another. Which place has been exchanged with x1 depends on the cmavo chosen. Thus, for example, when __se__ is used, the x1 place is swapped with the x2 place.
Note that the cmavo of SE begin with consecutive consonants in alphabetical order. There is no “1st place conversion” cmavo, because exchanging the x1 place with itself is a pointless maneuver.
Here are the place structures of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the destination of x2's going from x3 via x4 using x5
and _te klama_ :
> x1 is the origin and x2 the destination of x3 going via x4 using x5
and _ve klama_ :
> x1 is the route to x2 from x3 used by x4 going via x5
and _xe klama_ :
> x1 is the means in going to x2 from x3 via x4 employed by x5
Note that the place structure numbers in each case continue to be listed in the usual order, x1 to x5.
Consider the following pair of examples:
**Example 9.18. **
la | bastn. | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Boston |  | is-the-destination | of-me.  
Boston is my destination.  
---  
Boston is gone to by me.  
  

**Example 9.19. **
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I.  
To Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.18 and Example 9.19 mean the same thing, in the sense that there is a relationship of going with the speaker as the agent and Boston as the destination (and with unspecified origin, route, and means). Structurally, however, they are quite different. Example 9.18 has _la bastn._ in the x1 place and __mi__ in the x2 place of the selbri _se klama_ , and uses standard bridi order; Example 9.19 has __mi__ in the x1 place and _la bastn._ in the x2 place of the selbri __klama__ , and uses a non-standard order.
The most important use of conversion is in the construction of descriptions. A description is a sumti which begins with a cmavo of selma'o LA or LE, called the descriptor, and contains (in the simplest case) a selbri. We have already seen the descriptions _le dargu_ and _le karce_. To this we could add:
**Example 9.20. **
le | klama  
---|---  
the go-er, the one who goes  
---  
  

In every case, the description is about something which fits into the x1 place of the selbri. In order to get a description of a destination (that is, something fitting the x2 place of __klama__), we must convert the selbri to _se klama_ , whose x1 place is a destination. The result is
**Example 9.21. **
le | se | klama  
---|---|---  
the destination gone to by someone  
---  
  

Likewise, we can create three more converted descriptions:
**Example 9.22. **
le | te | klama  
---|---|---  
the origin of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.23. **
le | ve | klama  
---|---|---  
the route of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.24. **
le | xe | klama  
---|---|---  
the means by which someone goes  
---  
  

Example 9.23 does not mean “the route” plain and simple: that is _le pluta_ , using a different selbri. It means a route that is used by someone for an act of __klama__ ; that is, a journey with origin and destination. A “road” on Mars, on which no one has traveled or is ever likely to, may be called _le pluta_ , but it cannot be _le ve klama_ , since there exists no one for whom it is _le ve klama be fo da_ (the route taken in an actual journey by someone [da]).
When converting selbri that are more complex than a single brivla, it is important to realize that the scope of a SE cmavo is only the following brivla (or equivalent unit). In order to convert an entire tanru, it is necessary to enclose the tanru in __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets:
**Example 9.25. **
mi | se | ke | blanu | zdani | [ke'e] | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [2nd-conversion] | ( | blue | house | ) | this-thing  
  

The place structure of _blanu zdani_ (blue house) is the same as that of __zdani__ , by the rule given in Section 9.1. The place structure of __zdani__ is:
> _ _zdani_ _ x1 is a house/nest/lair/den for inhabitant x2
The place structure of _se ke blanu zdani [ke'e]_ is therefore:
> x1 is the inhabitant of the blue house (etc.) x2
Consequently, Example 9.25 means:
> I am the inhabitant of the blue house which is this thing.
Conversion applied to only part of a tanru has subtler effects which are explained in Section 5.11.
It is grammatical to convert a selbri more than once with SE; later (inner) conversions are applied before earlier (outer) ones. For example, the place structure of _se te klama_ is achieved by exchanging the x1 and x2 place of _te klama_ , producing:
> x1 is the destination and x2 is the origin of x3 going via x4 using x5
On the other hand, _te se klama_ has a place structure derived from swapping the x1 and x3 places of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the origin of x2's going to x3 via x4 using x5
which is quite different. However, multiple conversions like this are never necessary. Arbitrary scrambling of places can be achieved more easily and far more intelligibly with FA tags, and only a single conversion is ever needed in a description.
(Although no one has made any real use of it, it is perhaps worth noting that compound conversions of the form _setese_ , where the first and third cmavo are the same, effectively swap the two given places while leaving the others, including x1, alone: _setese_ (or equivalently _tesete_) swap the x2 and x3 places, whereas _texete_ (or _xetexe_) swap the x3 and x5 places.)

## 2.7. Varying the order of sumti
For one reason or another you may want to change the order, placing one particular sumti at the front of the bridi. The cmavo __se__ , when placed before the last word of the selbri, will switch the meanings of the first and second sumti places. So
**Example 2.21. **
mi |  tavla |  do |  ti  
---|---|---|---  
I talk to you about this.  
---  
  

has the same meaning as
**Example 2.22. **
do |  se tavla |  mi |  ti  
---|---|---|---  
You are talked to by me about this.  
---  
  

The cmavo __te__ , when used in the same location, switches the meanings of the first and the third sumti places.
**Example 2.23. **
mi |  tavla |  do |  ti  
---|---|---|---  
I talk to you about this.  
---  
  

has the same meaning as
**Example 2.24. **
ti |  te tavla |  do |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This is talked about to you by me.  
---  
  

Note that only the first and third sumti have switched places; the second sumti has remained in the second place.
The cmavo __ve__ and __xe__ switch the first and fourth sumti places, and the first and fifth sumti places, respectively. These changes in the order of places are known as “conversions”, and the __se__ , __te__ , __ve__ , and __xe__ cmavo are said to convert the selbri.
More than one of these operators may be used on a given selbri at one time, and in such a case they are evaluated from left to right. However, in practice they are used one at a time, as there are better tools for complex manipulation of the sumti places. See Section 9.4 for details.
The effect is similar to what in English is called the “passive voice”. In Lojban, the converted selbri has a new place structure that is renumbered to reflect the place reversal, thus having effects when such a conversion is used in combination with other constructs such as _le selbri [ku]_ (see Section 2.10).

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 9.16. CV'V cmavo of selma'o BAI with irregular forms
There are 65 cmavo of selma'o BAI, of which all but one (__do'e__ , discussed in Section 9.6), are derived directly from selected gismu. Of these 64 cmavo, 36 are entirely regular and have the form CV'V, where C is the first consonant of the corresponding gismu, and the Vs are the two vowels of the gismu. The remaining BAI cmavo, which are irregular in one way or another, are listed in the table below. The table is divided into sub-tables according to the nature of the exception; some cmavo appear in more than one sub-table, and are so noted.

## 9.17. Complete table of BAI cmavo with rough English equivalents
The following table shows all the cmavo belonging to selma'o BAI, and has five columns. The first column is the cmavo itself; the second column is the gismu linked to it. The third column gives an English phrase which indicates the meaning of the cmavo; and the fourth column indicates its meaning when preceded by __se__.
For those cmavo with meaningful __te__ , __ve__ , and even __xe__ conversions (depending on the number of places of the underlying gismu), the meanings of these are shown on one or two extra rows following the primary row for that cmavo.
It should be emphasized that the place structures of the gismu control the meanings of the BAI cmavo. The English phrases shown here are only suggestive, and are often too broad or too narrow to correctly specify what the acceptable range of uses for the modal tag are.

The lujvo __tamsmi__ on which __tai__ is based is derived from the tanru _tarmi simsa_ and has the place structure:
> _ _tamsmi_ _ x1 has form x2, similar in form to x3 in property/quality x4
This lujvo is employed because __tarmi__ does not have a place structure useful for the modal's purpose.

## 5.7. Linked sumti: _be_ -_bei_ -_be'o_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
be |  BE |  linked sumti marker  
---|---|---  
bei |  BEI |  linked sumti separator  
be'o |  BEhO |  linked sumti terminator  
The question of the place structures of selbri has been glossed over so far. This chapter does not attempt to treat place structure issues in detail; they are discussed in Chapter 9. One grammatical structure related to places belongs here, however. In simple sentences such as Example 5.1, the place structure of the selbri is simply the defined place structure of the gismu __mamta__. What about more complex selbri?
For tanru, the place structure rule is simple: the place structure of a tanru is always the place structure of its tertau. Thus, the place structure of _blanu zdani_ is that of __zdani__ : the x1 place is a house or nest, and the x2 place is its occupants.
What about the places of __blanu__? Is there any way to get them into the act? In fact, __blanu__ has only one place, and this is merged, as it were, with the x1 place of __zdani__. It is whatever is in the x1 place that is being characterized as blue-for-a-house. But if we replace __blanu__ with __xamgu__ , we get:
**Example 5.63. **
ti | xamgu | zdani  
---|---|---  
This | is-a-good | house.  
This is a good (for someone, by some standard) house.  
---  
  

Since __xamgu__ has three places (x1, the good thing; x2, the person for whom it is good; and x3, the standard of goodness), Example 5.63 necessarily omits information about the last two: there is no room for them. Room can be made, however!
**Example 5.64. **
ti | xamgu | be | do | bei | mi | [be'o] | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-good | (for | you | by-standard | me) |  | house.  
This is a house that is good for you by my standards.  
---  
  

Here, the gismu __xamgu__ has been followed by the cmavo __be__ (of selma'o BE), which signals that one or more sumti follows. These sumti are not part of the overall bridi place structure, but fill the places of the brivla they are attached to, starting with x2. If there is more than one sumti, they are separated by the cmavo __bei__ (of selma'o BEI), and the list of sumti is terminated by the elidable terminator __be'o__ (of selma'o BEhO).
Grammatically, a brivla with sumti linked to it in this fashion plays the same role in tanru as a simple brivla. To illustrate, here is a fully fleshed-out version of Example 5.19, with all places filled in:
**Example 5.65. **
ti | cmalu | be | le | ka | canlu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-small | (in-dimension | the | property-of | volume  
bei | lo'e | ckule | be'o  
---|---|---|---  
by-standard | the-typical | school) |   
nixli | be | li | mu  
---|---|---|---  
(girl | (of-years | the-number | five  
bei | lo | merko | be'o | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
by-standard | some | American-thing) |  |  | school)  
la | bryklyn.  
---|---  
in-that-named | Brooklyn  
loi | pemci  
---|---  
with-subject | poems  
le | mela | nu,IORK. | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
for-audience-the | among-that-named | New-York | persons  
le | jecta  
---|---  
with-operator-the | state.  
This is a school, small in volume compared to the typical school, pertaining to five-year-old girls (by American standards), in Brooklyn, teaching poetry to the New York community and operated by the state.  
---  
  

Here the three places of __cmalu__ , the three of __nixli__ , and the four of __ckule__ are fully specified. Since the places of __ckule__ are the places of the bridi as a whole, it was not necessary to link the sumti which follow __ckule__. It would have been legal to do so, however:
**Example 5.66. **
mi | klama | be | le | zarci | bei | le | zdani | [be'o]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go | ( | to-the | market |  | from-the | house | ).  
  

means the same as
**Example 5.67. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go | to-the | market | from-the | house.  
  

No matter how complex a tanru gets, the last brivla always dictates the place structure: the place structure of
**Example 5.68. **
| melbi | je | cmalu | nixli | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
a | (pretty | and | little) | (girl |  | school)  
a school for girls which is both beautiful and small  
---  
  

is simply that of __ckule__. (The sole exception to this rule is discussed in Section 5.8.)
It is possible to precede linked sumti by the place structure ordering tags __fe__ , __fi__ , __fo__ , and __fu__ (of selma'o FA, discussed further in Section 9.3), which serve to explicitly specify the x2, x3, x4, and x5 places respectively. Normally, the place following the __be__ is the x2 place and the other places follow in order. If it seems convenient to change the order, however, it can be accomplished as follows:
**Example 5.69. **
ti | xamgu | be | fi | mi | bei | fe | do | [be'o] | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-good | ( | by-standard | me |  | for | you | ) | house.  
  

which is equivalent in meaning to Example 5.64. Note that the order of __be__ , __bei__ , and __be'o__ does not change; only the inserted __fi__ tells us that __mi__ is the x3 place (and correspondingly, the inserted __fe__ tells us that __do__ is the x2 place). Changing the order of sumti is often done to match the order of another language, or for emphasis or rhythm.
Of course, using FA cmavo makes it easy to specify one place while omitting a previous place:
**Example 5.70. **
ti | xamgu | be | fi | mi | [be'o] | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-good | ( | by-standard | me | ) | house.  
This is a good house by my standards.  
---  
  

Similarly, sumti labeled by modal or tense tags can be inserted into strings of linked sumti just as they can into bridi:
**Example 5.71. **
ta | blanu | be | ga'a | mi | [be'o] | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-blue | ( | to-observer | me | ) | house.  
That is a blue, as I see it, house.  
---  
  

The meaning of Example 5.71 is slightly different from:
**Example 5.72. **
ta | blanu | zdani | ga'a | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-blue | house | to-observer | me.  
That is a blue house, as I see it.  
---  
  

See discussions in Chapter 9 of modals and in Chapter 10 of tenses for more explanations.
The terminator __be'o__ is almost always elidable: however, if the selbri belongs to a description, then a relative clause following it will attach to the last linked sumti unless __be'o__ is used, in which case it will attach to the outer description:
**Example 5.73. **
le | xamgu | be | do | noi | barda | cu | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | good-thing | for | you | (who | are-large) |  | is-a-house.  
  

**Example 5.74. **
le | xamgu | be | do | be'o | noi | barda | cu | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | (good-thing | for | you | ) | (which | is-large) |  | is-a-house  
  

(Relative clauses are explained in Chapter 8.)
In other cases, however, __be'o__ cannot be elided if __ku__ has also been elided:
**Example 5.75. **
le | xamgu | be | le | ctuca | [ku] | be'o | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | good | (for | the | teacher) |  |  | house  
  

requires either __ku__ or __be'o__ , and since there is only one occurrence of __be__ , the __be'o__ must match it, whereas it may be confusing which occurrence of __le__ the __ku__ terminates (in fact the second one is correct).

## 5.8. Inversion of tanru: _co_
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
co |  CO |  tanru inversion marker  
---|---|---  
The standard order of Lojban tanru, whereby the modifier precedes what it modifies, is very natural to English-speakers: we talk of “blue houses”, not of “houses blue”. In other languages, however, such matters are differently arranged, and Lojban supports this reverse order (tertau before seltau) by inserting the particle __co__. Example 5.76 and Example 5.77 mean exactly the same thing:
**Example 5.76. **
ta | blanu | zdani  
---|---|---  
That | is-a-blue | type-of-house.  
That is a blue house.  
---  
  

**Example 5.77. **
ta | zdani | co | blanu  
---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-house | of-type | blue.  
That is a blue house.  
---  
  

This change is called “tanru inversion”. In tanru inversion, the element before __co__ (__zdani__ in Example 5.77) is the tertau, and the element following __co__ (__blanu__) in Example 5.77) is the seltau.
The meaning, and more specifically, the place structure, of a tanru is not affected by inversion: the place structure of _zdani co blanu_ is still that of __zdani__. However, the existence of inversion in a selbri has a very special effect on any sumti which follow that selbri. Instead of being interpreted as filling places of the selbri, they actually fill the places (starting with x2) of the seltau. In Section 5.7, we saw how to fill interior places with __be__ … __bei__ … __be'o__ , and in fact Example 5.78 and Example 5.79 have the same meaning:
**Example 5.78. **
mi | klama | be | le | zarci | bei | le | zdani | be'o | troci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-a-(goer | to | the | market | from | the | house | ) | type-of-trier.  
I try to go to the market from the house.  
---  
  

**Example 5.79. **
mi | troci | co | klama | le | zarci | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-a-trier | of-type | (goer | to-the | market | from-the | house).  
I try to go to the market from the house.  
---  
  

Example 5.79 is a less deeply nested construction, requiring fewer cmavo. As a result it is probably easier to understand.
Note that in Lojban “trying to go” is expressed using __troci__ as the tertau. The reason is that “trying to go” is a “going type of trying”, not a “trying type of going”. The trying is more fundamental than the going – if the trying fails, we may not have a going at all.
Any sumti which precede a selbri with an inverted tanru fill the places of the selbri (i.e., the places of the tertau) in the ordinary way. In Example 5.79, __mi__ fills the x1 place of _troci co klama_ , which is the x1 place of __troci__. The other places of the selbri remain unfilled. The trailing sumti _le zarci_ and _le zdani_ do not occupy selbri places, despite appearances.
As a result, the regular mechanisms (involving selma'o VOhA and GOhI, explained in Chapter 7) for referring to individual sumti of a bridi cannot refer to any of the trailing places of Example 5.79, because they are not really “sumti of the bridi” at all.
When inverting a more complex tanru, it is possible to invert it only at the most general modifier-modified pair. The only possible inversion of Example 5.19, for instance, is:
**Example 5.80. **
ta | nixli | [bo] | ckule | co | cmalu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | (is-a-girl | type-of | school) | of-type | little.  
That's a girls' school which is small.  
---  
  

Note that the __bo__ of Example 5.19 is optional in Example 5.80, because __co__ groups more loosely than any other cmavo used in tanru, including none at all. Not even __ke__ … __ke'e__ parentheses can encompass a __co__ :
**Example 5.81. **
ta | cmalu |  | ke | nixli |  | ckule | [ke'e] | co | melbi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-(little | type-of | ( | girl | type-of | school | )) | of-type | pretty.  
That's a small school for girls which is beautiful.  
---  
  

In Example 5.81, the __ke'e__ is automatically inserted before the __co__ rather than at its usual place at the end of the selbri. As a result, there is a simple and mechanical rule for removing __co__ from any selbri: change “A co B” to “ke B ke'e A”. (At the same time, any sumti following the selbri must be transformed into __be__ … __bei__ … __be'o__ form and attached following B.) Therefore,
**Example 5.82. **
ckule | co | melbi | nixli  
---|---|---|---  
school | of-type | pretty | girl  
school for beautiful girls  
---  
  

means the same as:
**Example 5.83. **
ke | melbi | nixli | ke'e | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
( | pretty | girl | ) | school  
  

Multiple __co__ cmavo can appear within a selbri, indicating multiple inversions: a right-grouping rule is employed, as for __bo__. The above rule can be applied to interpret such selbri, but all __co__ cmavo must be removed simultaneously:
**Example 5.84. **
ckule | co | nixli | co | cmalu  
---|---|---|---|---  
school | of-type | (girl | of-type | little)  
  

becomes formally
**Example 5.85. **
ke | ke | cmalu | ke'e | nixli | ke'e | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | ( | little | ) | girl | ) | school  
  

which by the left-grouping rule is simply
**Example 5.86. **
cmalu | nixli | ckule  
---|---|---  
little | girl | school  
school for little girls  
---  
  

As stated above, the selbri places, other than the first, of
**Example 5.87. **
mi | klama | co | sutra  
---|---|---|---  
I | am-a-goer | of-type | quick  
I go quickly  
---  
  

cannot be filled by placing sumti after the selbri, because any sumti in that position fill the places of __sutra__ , the seltau. However, the tertau places (which means in effect the selbri places) can be filled with __be__ :
**Example 5.88. **
mi | klama | be | le | zarci | be'o | co | sutra  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-a-goer | ( | to-the | store | ) | of-type | quick.  
I go to the store quickly.  
---
