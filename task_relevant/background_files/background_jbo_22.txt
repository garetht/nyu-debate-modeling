## 16.10. bridi negation and logical connectives
A complete discussion of logical connectives appears in Chapter 14. What is said here is intentionally quite incomplete and makes several oversimplifications.
A logical connective is a cmavo or compound cmavo. In this chapter, we will make use of the logical connectives “and” and “or” (where “or” really means “and/or”, “either or both”). The following simplified recipes explain how to make some logical connectives:
  * To logically connect two Lojban sumti with “and”, put them both in the bridi and separate them with the cmavo __e__.
  * To logically connect two Lojban bridi with “and”, replace the regular separator cmavo __i__ with the compound cmavo __.ije__.
  * To logically connect two Lojban sumti with “or”, put them both in the bridi and separate them with the cmavo __a__.
  * To logically connect two Lojban bridi with “or”, replace the regular separator cmavo __i__ with the compound cmavo __.ija__.


More complex logical connectives also exist; in particular, one may place __na__ before __e__ or __a__ , or between __i__ and __je__ or __ja__ ; likewise, one may place __nai__ at the end of a connective. Both __na__ and __nai__ have negative effects on the sumti or bridi being connected. Specifically, __na__ negates the first or left-hand sumti or bridi, and __nai__ negates the second or right-hand one.
Whenever a logical connective occurs in a sentence, that sentence can be expanded into two sentences by repeating the common terms and joining the sentences by a logical connective beginning with __i__. Thus the following sentence:
**Example 16.73. **
mi | .e | do | klama | ti  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | and | you | come-to | this-here  
I and you come here.  
---  
  

can be expanded to:
**Example 16.74. **
mi | klama | ti | .ije | do | klama | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | come-to | this-here | and | you | come-to | this-here  
I come here, and, you come here.  
---  
  

The same type of expansion can be performed for any logical connective, with any valid combination of __na__ or __nai__ attached. No change in meaning occurs under such a transformation.
Clearly, if we know what negation means in the expanded sentence forms, then we know what it means in all of the other forms. But what does negation mean between sentences?
The mystery is easily solved. A negation in a logical expression is identical to the corresponding bridi negation, with the negator placed at the beginning of the prenex. Thus:
**Example 16.75. **
mi | .enai | do | prami | roda  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | and-not | you | love | everything  
I, and not you, love everything.  
---  
  

expands to:
**Example 16.76. **
mi | prami | roda | .ijenai | do | prami | roda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | love | everything, | and-not, | you | love | everything.  
  

and then into prenex form as:
**Example 16.77. **
roda | zo'u | mi | prami | da | .ije  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-each-thing | : | I | love | it, | and  
naku | zo'u | do | prami | da  
---|---|---|---|---  
it-is-false-that | : | you | love | (the-same)-it.  
For each thing: I love it, and it is false that you love (the same) it.  
---  
  

By the rules of predicate logic, the __ro__ quantifier on __da__ has scope over both sentences. That is, once you've picked a value for __da__ for the first sentence, it stays the same for both sentences. (The __da__ continues with the same fixed value until a new paragraph or a new prenex resets the meaning.)
Thus the following example has the indicated translation:
**Example 16.78. **
su'oda | zo'u | mi | prami | da  
---|---|---|---|---  
For-at-least-one-thing | : | I | love | that-thing.  
.ije | naku | zo'u | do | prami | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
And | it-is-false-that | : | you | love | that-(same)-thing.  
There is something that I love that you don't.  
---  
  

If you remember only two rules for prenex manipulation of negations, you won't go wrong:
  * Within a prenex, whenever you move _naku_ past a bound variable (da, de, di, etc.), you must invert the quantifier.
  * A __na__ before the selbri is always transformed into a _naku_ at the left-hand end of the prenex, and vice versa.

## 16.9. Negation boundaries
This section, as well as Section 16.10 through Section 16.12, are in effect a continuation of Chapter 15, introducing features of Lojban negation that require an understanding of prenexes and variables. In the examples below, “there is a Y” and the like must be understood as “there is at least one Y, possibly more”.
As explained in Section 15.2, the negation of a bridi is usually accomplished by inserting __na__ at the beginning of the selbri:
**Example 16.57. **
mi | na | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [false] | go-to | the | store.  
It is false that I go to the store.  
---  
I don't go to the store.  
  

The other form of bridi negation is expressed by using the compound cmavo _naku_ in the prenex, which is identified and compounded by the lexer before looking at the sentence grammar. In Lojban grammar, _naku_ is then treated like a sumti. In a prenex, _naku_ means precisely the same thing as the logician's “it is not the case that” in a similar English context. (Outside of a prenex, _naku_ is also grammatically treated as a single entity – the equivalent of a sumti – but does not have this exact meaning; we'll discuss these other situations in Section 16.11.)
To represent a bridi negation using a prenex, remove the __na__ from before the selbri and place _naku_ at the left end of the prenex. This form is called “external bridi negation”, as opposed to “internal bridi negation” using __na__. The prenex version of Example 16.57 is
**Example 16.58. **
naku | zo'u | la | djan. | klama  
---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-not-the-case-that | : | that-named | John | comes.  
It is false that: John comes.  
---  
  

However, _naku_ can appear at other points in the prenex as well. Compare
**Example 16.59. **
naku | de | zo'u | de | zutse  
---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-not-the-case-that: | for-some-Y | : | Y | sits.  
It-is-false-that: | for-at-least-one-Y | : | Y | sits.  
It is false that something sits.  
---  
Nothing sits.  
  

with
**Example 16.60. **
su'ode | naku | zo'u | de | zutse  
---|---|---|---|---  
For-at-least-one-Y, | it-is-false-that | : | Y | sits.  
There is something that doesn't sit.  
---  
  

The relative position of negation and quantification terms within a prenex has a drastic effect on meaning. Starting without a negation, we can have:
**Example 16.61. **
roda | su'ode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every-X, | there-is-a-Y, | such-that | X | loves | Y.  
Everybody loves at least one thing (each, not necessarily the same thing).  
---  
  

or:
**Example 16.62. **
su'ode | roda | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-a-Y, | such-that-for-each-X | : | X | loves | Y.  
There is at least one particular thing that is loved by everybody.  
---  
  

The simplest form of bridi negation to interpret is one where the negation term is at the beginning of the prenex:
**Example 16.63. **
naku | roda | su'ode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-false-that: | for-every-X, | there-is-a-Y, | such-that: | X | loves | Y.  
It is false that: everybody loves at least one thing.  
---  
(At least) someone doesn't love anything.  
  

the negation of Example 16.61, and
**Example 16.64. **
naku | su'ode | roda | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-false-that: | there-is-a-Y | such-that | for-each-X | : | X | loves | Y.  
It is false that: there is at least one thing that is loved by everybody.  
---  
There isn't any one thing that everybody loves.  
  

the negation of Example 16.62.
The rules of formal logic require that, to move a negation boundary within a prenex, you must “invert any quantifier” that the negation boundary passes across. Inverting a quantifier means that any __ro__ (all) is changed to __su'o__ (at least one) and vice versa. Thus, Example 16.63 and Example 16.64 can be restated as, respectively:
**Example 16.65. **
su'oda | naku | su'ode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-some-X, | it-is-false-that: | there-is-a-Y | such-that: | X | loves | Y.  
There is somebody who doesn't love anything.  
---  
  

and:
**Example 16.66. **
rode | naku | roda | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every-Y, | it-is-false-that: | for-every-X | : | X | loves | Y.  
For each thing, it is not true that everybody loves it.  
---  
  

Another movement of the negation boundary produces:
**Example 16.67. **
su'oda | rode | naku | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X | such-that-for-every-Y, | it-is-false-that | : | X | loves | Y.  
There is someone who, for each thing, doesn't love that thing.  
---  
  

and
**Example 16.68. **
rode | su'oda | naku | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every-Y, | there-is-an-X, | such-that-it-is-false-that | : | X | loves | Y.  
For each thing there is someone who doesn't love it.  
---  
  

Investigation will show that, indeed, each transformation preserves the meanings of Example 16.63 and Example 16.64.
The quantifier __no__ (meaning “zero of”) also involves a negation boundary. To transform a bridi containing a variable quantified with __no__ , we must first expand it. Consider
**Example 16.69. **
noda | rode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-no-X, | for-every-Y, | such-that | X | loves | Y.  
Nobody loves everything.  
---  
  

which is negated by:
**Example 16.70. **
naku | noda | rode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-false-that: | there-is-no-X-that, | for-every-Y | : | X | loves | Y.  
It is false that there is nobody who loves everything.  
---  
  

We can simplify Example 16.70 by transforming the prenex. To move the negation phrase within the prenex, we must first expand the __no__ quantifier. Thus “for no x” means the same thing as “it is false for some x”, and the corresponding Lojban __noda__ can be replaced by _naku su'oda_. Making this substitution, we get:
**Example 16.71. **
naku | naku | su'oda  
---|---|---  
It-is-false-that | it-is-false-that | there-is-some-X-such-that  
…rode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---  
for-every-X | : | X | loves | Y  
It is false that it is false that: for an X, for every Y: X loves Y.  
---  
  

Adjacent pairs of negation boundaries in the prenex can be dropped, so this means the same as:
**Example 16.72. **
su'oda | rode | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X-such-that, | for-every-Y | : | X | loves | Y.  
At least one person loves everything.  
---  
  

which is clearly the desired contradiction of Example 16.69.
The interactions between quantifiers and negation mean that you cannot eliminate double negatives that are not adjacent. You must first move the negation phrases so that they are adjacent, inverting any quantifiers they cross, and then the double negative can be eliminated.

## 14.7. More than two propositions
So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.
Of the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,
**Example 14.31. **
mi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,
**Example 14.32. **
mi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that one or more of the component sentences is true.
O, however, is different. Working out the truth table for
**Example 14.33. **
mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  
  

shows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:
> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.
Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.
In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.
There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: 
**Example 14.34. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  
.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

Does this mean:
**Example 14.35. **
I like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.
  

Or is the correct translation:
**Example 14.36. **
Either I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.
  

Example 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:
**Example 14.37. **
ga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | I | like | that-named | Martha)  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas
**Example 14.38. **
ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary).  
  

is not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.

## 14.8. Grouping of afterthought connectives
There are several ways in Lojban to render Example 14.35 using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo __bo__ (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with __bo__ are interpreted before connections not so marked. Example 14.39 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.38:
**Example 14.39. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John, | and | I | like | that-named | Martha  
.ijabo | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by __.i__ __ja__ first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by __.i__ __je__.
Eks can have __bo__ attached in exactly the same way, so that Example 14.40 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39:
**Example 14.40. **
mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with __bo__ , for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.
What happens if __bo__ is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in Example 14.41?
**Example 14.41. **
mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Does this wind up meaning the same as Example 14.34 and Example 14.36? Not at all. A second rule relating to __bo__ is that where several __bo__ -marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, Example 14.41 in fact means the same as Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with __bo__ should be avoided.
The use of __bo__ , therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of Example 14.37 and Example 14.38, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ are used with ijeks, and __ke__ and __ke'e__ with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (__ke__ and __ke'e__ are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.42. **
I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
  

where the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express Example 14.42 in afterthought, we can say:
**Example 14.43. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije[bo] | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me,  
.ijanai | mi | prami | do | .ijebo | do | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | I | love | you | and | you | love | me.  
  

marking two of the ijeks with __bo__ for high precedence. (The first __bo__ is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)
But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:
**Example 14.44. **
tu'e | mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me | )  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

where the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ pairs set off the structure. The cmavo __tu'u__ is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in Example 14.44 is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.
In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to __bo__ grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.
Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:
**Example 14.45. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider
**Example 14.46. **
I walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.
  

Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to Example 14.44, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with __ke__ , so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing Example 14.47, which is instead parallel to Example 14.45:
**Example 14.47. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | the | house  
.a | ke | le | ckule | .e | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | the | school | and | the | office | ).  
  

If sumti were allowed to begin with __ke__ , unavoidable ambiguities would result, so __ke__ grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to __tu'e__ grouping of bridi, as Example 14.44 shows.
Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of Example 14.33: “I am German, rich, and a man – or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:
**Example 14.48. **
[tu'e] | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-rich | )  
.ije | tu'e | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | nanmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | ( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-a-man | ).  
  

The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.

## 10.15. Tenses in subordinate bridi
English has a set of rules, formally known as “sequence of tense rules”, for determining what tense should be used in a subordinate clause, depending on the tense used in the main sentence. Here are some examples:
**Example 10.100. **
John says that George is going to the market.
  

**Example 10.101. **
John says that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.102. **
John said that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.103. **
John said that George had gone to the market.
  

In Example 10.100 and Example 10.101, the tense of the main sentence is the present: “says”. If George goes when John speaks, we get the present tense “is going” (“goes” would be unidiomatic); if George goes before John speaks, we get the past tense “went”. But if the tense of the main sentence is the past, with “said”, then the tense required in the subordinate clause is different. If George goes when John speaks, we get the past tense “went”; if George goes before John speaks, we get the past-perfect tense “had gone”.
The rule of English, therefore, is that both the tense of the main sentence and the tense of the subordinate clause are understood relative to the speaker of the main sentence (not John, but the person who speaks Example 10.100 through Example 10.103).
Lojban, like Russian and Esperanto, uses a different convention. A tense in a subordinate bridi is understood to be relative to the tense already set in the main bridi. Thus Example 10.100 through Example 10.103 can be expressed in Lojban respectively thus:
**Example 10.104. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.105. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.106. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.107. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

Probably the most counterintuitive of the Lojban examples is Example 10.106. The __ca__ looks quite odd, as if George were going to the market right now, rather than back when John spoke. But this __ca__ is really a __ca__ with respect to a reference point specified by the outer __pu__. This behavior is the same as the additive behavior of multiple tenses in the same bridi, as explained in Section 10.13.
There is a special cmavo __nau__ (of selma'o CUhE) which can be used to override these rules and get to the speaker's current reference point. (Yes, it sounds like English “now”.) It is not grammatical to combine __nau__ with any other cmavo in a tense, except by way of a logical or non-logical connection (see Section 10.20). Here is a convoluted sentence with several nested bridi which uses __nau__ at the lowest level:
**Example 10.108. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | .alis | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | maris. | nau | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Mary | [now] | goes-to | the | market.  
John said that Alice had said that George had earlier said that Mary is now going to the market.  
---  
  

The use of __nau__ does not affect sticky tenses.

## 11.7. Predication/sentence abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
du'u |  NU |  predication abstraction  
---|---|---  
There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:
**Example 11.42. **
I know that Frank is a fool.
  

How's that in Lojban? Let us try:
**Example 11.43. **
mi | djuno | le | nu | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the event of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can't be contained inside one's mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; Example 11.43 comes close to claiming that Frank's being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, Example 11.43 is an instance of improperly marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in Section 11.10).
Try again:
**Example 11.44. **
mi | djuno | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Closer. Example 11.44 says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn't say that he is one, as Example 11.42 does. To catch that nuance, we must say:
**Example 11.45. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the predication that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a fool” is not a property of _le du'u_ abstraction, but of __djuno__ ; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, __djuno__ like __jei__ has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) Example 11.46 has no such implied assertion:
**Example 11.46. **
mi | kucli | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

and here __du'u__ could probably be replaced by __jei__ without much change in meaning:
**Example 11.47. **
mi | kucli | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about how true it is that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, __du'u__ has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:
> _ _du'u_ _ x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2
and _le se du'u ..._ is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:
**Example 11.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | le | se du'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses | the | (sentence-expressing-that  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes-to | the | store | )  
John says that George goes to the store.  
---  
  

Example 11.48 differs from
**Example 11.49. **
la | djan | cusku | lu  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses, | quote,  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes | to-the | store, | unquote.  
John says “George goes to the store”.  
---  
  

because Example 11.49 claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas Example 11.48 claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.
_le se du'u_ is much the same as _lu'e le du'u_ , a symbol for the predication, but _se du'u_ can be used as a selbri, whereas __lu'e__ is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See Section 6.10 for a discussion of __lu'e__.)

## 7.12. Bound variable pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the da-series and the bu'a-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
da |  KOhA |  da-series |  something-1   
---|---|---|---  
de |  KOhA |  da-series |  something-2  
di |  KOhA |  da-series |  something-3

Bound variables belong to the predicate-logic part of Lojban, and are listed here for completeness only. Their semantics is explained in Chapter 16. It is worth mentioning that the Lojban translation of Example 7.2 is:
**Example 7.73. **
la | djan. | cu | lafti | da | poi

That-named | John |  | raised | something-1 | which  
grana | ku'o | gi'e | desygau | da

## 16.6. Variables with generalized quantifiers
So far, we have seen variables with either nothing in front, or with the cmavo __ro__ in front. Now __ro__ is a Lojban number, and means “all”; thus _ro prenu_ means “all persons”, just as _re prenu_ means “two persons”. In fact, unadorned __da__ is also taken to have an implicit number in front of it, namely __su'o__ , which means “at least one”. Why is this? Consider Example 16.9 again, this time with an explicit __su'o__ :
**Example 16.33. **
su'o | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-at-least-one | X | : | X | sees | me.  
Something sees me.  
---  
  

From this version of Example 16.9, we understand the speaker's claim to be that of all the things that there are, at least one of them sees him or her. The corresponding universal claim, Example 16.16, says that of all the things that exist, every one of them can see the speaker.
Any other number can be used instead of __ro__ or __su'o__ to precede a variable. Then we get claims like:
**Example 16.34. **
re | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-two | Xes | : | X | sees | me.  
Two things see me.  
---  
  

This means that exactly two things, no more or less, saw the speaker on the relevant occasion. In English, we might take “Two things see me” to mean that at least two things see the speaker, but there might be more; in Lojban, though, that claim would have to be made as:
**Example 16.35. **
su'ore | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-at-least-two | Xes | : | X | sees | me.  
  

which would be false if nothing, or only one thing, saw the speaker, but not otherwise. We note the __su'o__ here meaning “at least”; __su'o__ by itself is short for _su'opa_ where __pa__ means “one”, as is explained in Section 18.9.
The prenex may be removed from Example 16.34 and Example 16.35 as from the others, leading to:
**Example 16.36. **
re | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---  
Two | Xes | see | me.  
  

and
**Example 16.37. **
su'ore | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---  
At-least-two | Xes | see | me.  
  

respectively, subject to the rules prescribed in Section 16.5.
Now we can explain the constructions _ro prenu_ for “all persons” and _re prenu_ for “two persons” which were casually mentioned at the beginning of this Section. In fact, _ro prenu_ , a so-called “indefinite description”, is shorthand for _ro DA poi prenu_ , where “DA” represents a fictitious variable that hasn't been used yet and will not be used in future. (Even if all three of __da__ , __de__ , and __di__ have been used up, it does not matter, for there are ways of getting more variables, discussed in Section 16.14.) So in fact
**Example 16.38. **
re | prenu | cu | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
Two | persons |  | see | me.  
  

is short for
**Example 16.39. **
re | da | poi | prenu | cu | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | Xes | which | are-persons |  | see | me.  
  

which in turn is short for:
**Example 16.40. **
re | da | poi | prenu | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-two | Xes | which | are-persons | : | X | sees | me.  
  

Note that when we move more than one variable to the prenex (along with its attached relative clause), we must make sure that the variables are in the same order in the prenex as in the bridi proper.

## 8.8. Relative clauses and complex sumti: _vu'o_
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
vu'o |  VUhO |  relative clause attacher  
---|---|---  
Normally, relative clauses attach only to simple sumti or parts of sumti: pro-sumti, names and descriptions, pure numbers, and quotations. An example of a relative clause attached to a pure number is:
**Example 8.66. **
li | pai | noi | na'e | frinu | namcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | pi, | incidentally-which | is-a-non- | fraction | number  
The irrational number pi  
---  
  

And here is an incidental relative clause attached to a quotation:
**Example 8.67. **
lu | mi | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[quote] | I | go-to | the | market | [unquote]  
noi | mi | cusku | ke'a | cu | jufra  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
incidentally-which-( | I | express | IT | ) | is-a-sentence.  
“I'm going to the market”, which I'd said, is a sentence.  
---  
  

which may serve to identify the author of the quotation or some other relevant, but subsidiary, fact about it. All such relative clauses appear only after the simple sumti, never before it.
In addition, sumti with attached sumti qualifiers of selma'o LAhE or NAhE+BO (which are explained in detail in Section 6.10) can have a relative clause appearing after the qualifier and before the qualified sumti, as in:
**Example 8.68. **
la'e | poi | tolcitno | vau | lu | le | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A-referent-of | (which | is-old | ) | [quote] | The | Red  
cmaxirma | li'u | cu | zvati | le | vu | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Small-horse | [unquote] |  | is-at | the | [far-distance] | room.  
An old “The Red Pony” is in the far room.  
---  
  

Example 8.68 is a bit complex, and may need some picking apart. The quotation _lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u_ means the string of words “The Red Pony”. If the __la'e__ at the beginning of the sentence were omitted, Example 8.68 would claim that a certain string of words is in a room distant from the speaker. But obviously a string of words can't be in a room! The effect of the __la'e__ is to modify the sumti so that it refers not to the words themselves, but to the referent of those words, a novel by John Steinbeck (presumably in Lojban translation). The particular copy of “The Red Pony” is identified by the restrictive relative clause. Example 8.68 means exactly the same as:
**Example 8.69. **
la'e | lu | le | xunre | cmaxirma | li'u | lu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A-referent-of | ([quote] | The | Red | Small-horse | [unquote] | )  
poi | to'ercitno | cu | zvati | le | vu | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
which | is-old |  | is-at | the | [far-distance] | room.  
  

and the two sentences can be considered stylistic variants. Note the required __lu'u__ terminator, which prevents the relative clause from attaching to the quotation itself: we do not wish to refer to an old quotation!
Sometimes, however, it is important to make a relative clause apply to the whole of a more complex sumti, one which involves logical or non-logical connection (explained in Chapter 14). For example,
**Example 8.70. **
la | frank. | .e | la | djordj. | noi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | and | that-named | George | incidentally-who  
nanmu | cu | klama | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---  
is-a-man |  | go-to | the | house.  
Frank and George, who is a man, go to the house.  
---  
  

The incidental claim in Example 8.70 is not that Frank and George are men, but only that George is a man, because the incidental relative clause attaches only to _la djordj_ , the immediately preceding simple sumti.
To make a relative clause attach to both parts of the logically connected sumti in Example 8.70, a new cmavo is needed, __vu'o__ (of selma'o VUhO). It is placed between the sumti and the relative clause, and extends the sphere of influence of that relative clause to the entire preceding sumti, including however many logical or non-logical connectives there may be.
**Example 8.71. **
la | frank. | .e | la | djordj. | vu'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
(That-named | Frank | and | that-named | George | )  
noi | nanmu | cu | klama | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
incidentally-who | are-men |  | go | to-the | house.  
Frank and George, who are men, go to the house.  
---  
  

The presence of __vu'o__ here means that the relative clause _noi nanmu_ extends to the entire logically connected sumti _la frank. .e la djordj._ ; in other words, both Frank and George are claimed to be men, as the colloquial translation shows.
English is able to resolve the distinction correctly in the case of Example 8.70 and Example 8.71 by making use of number: “who is” rather than “who are”. Lojban doesn't distinguish between singular and plural verbs: __nanmu__ can mean “is a man” or “are men”, so another means is required. Furthermore, Lojban's mechanism works correctly in general: if __nanmu__ (meaning “is-a-man”) were replaced with _pu bajra_ (“ran”), English would have to make the distinction some other way:
**Example 8.72. **
la | frank. | .e | la | djordj. | noi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | and | (that-named | George | who  
pu | bajra | cu | klama | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[past] | runs) |  | go-to | the | house.  
Frank and George, who ran, go to the house.  
---  
  

**Example 8.73. **
la | frank. | .e | la | djordj. | vu'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
(That-named | Frank | and | that-named | George | )  
noi | pu | bajra | cu | klama | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
who | [past] | run |  | go-to | the | house.  
Frank and George, who ran, go to the house.  
---  
  

In spoken English, tone of voice would serve; in written English, one or both sentences would need rewriting.

## 16.11. Using _naku_ outside a prenex
Let us consider the English sentence
**Example 16.79. **
Some children do not go to school.
  

We cannot express this directly with __na__ ; the apparently obvious translation
**Example 16.80. **
su'oda | poi | verba  
---|---|---  
At-least-one-X | which-are | child(ren)  
na | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
[false] | go-to | at-least-one-Y | which-are | school(s).  
  

when converted to the external negation form produces:
**Example 16.81. **
naku | zo'u | su'oda | poi | verba | cu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-false | that | some-which | are | children |   
klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---  
go-to | some-which | are | schools.  
All children don't go to some school (not just some children).  
---  
  

Lojban provides a negation form which more closely emulates natural language negation. This involves putting _naku_ before the selbri, instead of a __na__. _naku_ is clearly a contradictory negation, given its parallel with prenex bridi negation. Using _naku_ , Example 16.79 can be expressed as:
**Example 16.82. **
su'oda | poi | verba | naku | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | which-are | children | don't | go-to | some | which-are | schools.  
Some children don't go to a school.  
---  
  

Although it is not technically a sumti, _naku_ can be used in most of the places where a sumti may appear. We'll see what this means in a moment.
When you use _naku_ within a bridi, you are explicitly creating a negation boundary. As explained in Section 16.9, when a prenex negation boundary expressed by _naku_ moves past a quantifier, the quantifier has to be inverted. The same is true for _naku_ in the bridi proper. We can move _naku_ to any place in the sentence where a sumti can go, inverting any quantifiers that the negation boundary crosses. Thus, the following are equivalent to Example 16.82 (no good English translations exist):
**Example 16.83. **
su'oda | poi | verba | cu | klama | rode | poi | ckule | naku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For some children, for every school, they don't go to it.  
---  
  

**Example 16.84. **
su'oda | poi | verba | cu | klama | naku | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some children don't go to (some) school(s).  
---  
  

**Example 16.85. **
naku | roda | poi | verba | cu | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is false that all children go to some school(s).  
---  
  

In Example 16.83, we moved the negation boundary rightward across the quantifier of __de__ , forcing us to invert it. In Example 16.85 we moved the negation boundary across the quantifier of __da__ , forcing us to invert it instead. Example 16.84 merely switched the selbri and the negation boundary, with no effect on the quantifiers.
The same rules apply if you rearrange the sentence so that the quantifier crosses an otherwise fixed negation. You can't just convert the selbri of Example 16.82 and rearrange the sumti to produce
**Example 16.86. **
su'ode | poi | ckule | ku'o | naku | se | klama | roda | poi | verba  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some schools aren't gone-to-by every child.  
---  
  

or rather, Example 16.86 means something completely different from Example 16.82. Conversion with __se__ under _naku_ negation is not symmetric; not all sumti are treated identically, and some sumti are not invariant under conversion. Thus, internal negation with _naku_ is considered an advanced technique, used to achieve stylistic compatibility with natural languages.
It isn't always easy to see which quantifiers have to be inverted in a sentence. Example 16.82 is identical in meaning to:
**Example 16.87. **
su'o | verba | naku | klama | su'o | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | children | don't | go-to | some | school.  
  

but in Example 16.87, the bound variables __da__ and __de__ have been hidden.
It is trivial to export an internal bridi negation expressed with __na__ to the prenex, as we saw in Section 16.9; you just move it to the left end of the prenex. In comparison, it is non-trivial to export a _naku_ to the prenex because of the quantifiers. The rules for exporting _naku_ require that you export all of the quantified variables (implicit or explicit) along with _naku_ , and you must export them from left to right, in the same order that they appear in the sentence. Thus Example 16.82 goes into prenex form as:
**Example 16.88. **
su'oda | poi | verba | ku'o | naku  
---|---|---|---|---  
For-some-X | which | is-a-child, |  | it-is-not-the-case-that  
su'ode | poi | ckule | zo'u | da | klama | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-is-a-Y | which | is-a-school | such-that: | X | goes | to | Y.  
  

We can now move the _naku_ to the left end of the prenex, getting a contradictory negation that can be expressed with __na__ :
**Example 16.89. **
naku | roda | poi | verba  
---|---|---|---  
It-is-not-the-case-that | for-all-X's | which-are | children,  
su'ode | poi | ckule | zo'u | da | klama | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-is-a-Y | which-is | a-school | such-that: | X | goes-to | Y.  
  

from which we can restore the quantified variables to the sentence, giving:
**Example 16.90. **
naku | zo'u | roda | poi | verba | cu | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is not the case that all children go to some school.  
---  
  

or more briefly
**Example 16.91. **
ro | verba | cu | na | klama | su'o | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | children |  | [false] | go-to | some | school(s).  
  

As noted in Section 16.5, a sentence with two different quantified variables, such as Example 16.91, cannot always be converted with __se__ without first exporting the quantified variables. When the variables have been exported, the sentence proper can be converted, but the quantifier order in the prenex must remain unchanged:
**Example 16.92. **
roda | poi | verba | su'ode  
---|---|---|---  
for-all-X's | which-are | children, | there-is-a-Y  
poi | ckule | zo'u | de | na | se | klama | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
which | is-a-school | such-that: | Y |  |  | is-gone-to-by | X.  
  

While you can't freely convert with __se__ when you have two quantified variables in a sentence, you can still freely move sumti to either side of the selbri, as long as the order isn't changed. If you use __na__ negation in such a sentence, nothing special need be done. If you use _naku_ negation, then quantified variables that cross the negation boundary must be inverted.
Clearly, if all of Lojban negation was built on _naku_ negation instead of __na__ negation, logical manipulation in Lojban would be as difficult as in natural languages. In Section 16.12, for example, we'll discuss DeMorgan's Law, which must be used whenever a sumti with a logical connection is moved across a negation boundary.
Since _naku_ has the grammar of a sumti, it can be placed almost anywhere a sumti can go, including __be__ and __bei__ clauses; it isn't clear what these mean, and we recommend avoiding such constructs.
You can put multiple _naku_ compounds in a sentence, each forming a separate negation boundary. Two adjacent _naku_ compounds in a bridi are a double negative and cancel out:
**Example 16.93. **
mi naku naku le zarci cu klama
  

Other expressions using two _naku_ compounds may or may not cancel out. If there is no quantified variable between them, then the _naku_ compounds cancel.
Negation with internal _naku_ is clumsy and non-intuitive for logical manipulations, but then, so are the natural language features it is emulating.

## 8.10. Relative clauses within relative clauses
For the most part, these are straightforward and uncomplicated: a sumti that is part of a relative clause bridi may itself be modified by a relative clause:
**Example 8.81. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | blanu | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | is-blue |  | is-slow.  
  

However, an ambiguity can exist if __ke'a__ is used in a relative clause within a relative clause: does it refer to the outermost sumti, or to the sumti within the outer relative clause to which the inner relative clause is attached? The latter. To refer to the former, use a subscript on __ke'a__ :
**Example 8.82. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'axire | zbasu | ke'a | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | IT-sub-2 | built | IT |  | is-slow.  
The person who is in the room which he built is slow.  
---  
  

Here, the meaning of “IT-sub-2” is that sumti attached to the second relative clause, counting from the innermost, is used. Therefore, _ke'axipa_ (IT-sub-1) means the same as plain __ke'a__.
Alternatively, you can use a prenex (explained in full in Chapter 16), which is syntactically a series of sumti followed by the special cmavo __zo'u__ , prefixed to the relative clause bridi:
**Example 8.83. **
le | prenu | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'a | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | who | (IT | = | it1 | :  
ko'a | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'e | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | is-in | the | room | which | (IT | = | it2 | :  
ko'a | zbasu | ko'e | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | built | it2) |  | is-slow.  
  

Example 8.83 is more verbose than Example 8.82, but may be clearer, since it explicitly spells out the two __ke'a__ cmavo, each on its own level, and assigns them to the assignable cmavo __ko'a__ and __ko'e__ (explained in Section 7.5).

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  
I'm worn out by your continuous talking.  
---  
  

**Example 13.27. **
.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  
I'm putting you to bed.  
---  
  

**Example 13.28. **
.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.  
---  
  

**Example 13.29. **
.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  
I hope I feel better tomorrow!  
---  
  

**Example 13.30. **
.au | mi | sipna  
---|---|---  
[desire] | I | sleep.  
I want to sleep.  
---  
  

**Example 13.31. **
.a'ucu'i | do | pante  
---|---|---  
[no-interest] | you | complain.  
I have no interest in your complaints.  
---  
  

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  
I feel up to dealing with you.  
---  
  

**Example 13.34. **
.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  
I should fill the car's gas tank.  
---  
  

**Example 13.35. **
.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  
---|---|---|---  
[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  
Please take care of yourself!  
---  
  

**Example 13.36. **
.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  
I suggest going to the park.  
---  
  

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  
I can't believe you thought you could fool me.  
---  
  

**Example 13.38. **
do | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  
I blame you for not coming home.  
---  
  

**Example 13.39. **
.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  
le | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  
It's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  
---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  
---

no |  PA |  0  
The simplest kind of mekso are numbers, which are cmavo or compound cmavo. There are cmavo for each of the 10 decimal digits, and numbers greater than 9 are made by stringing together the cmavo. Some examples:
**Example 18.2. **
pa | re | ci  
---|---|---  
one | two | three  
123  
one hundred and twenty three  
---  
  

**Example 18.3. **
pa | no  
---|---  
one | zero  
10  
ten  
---  
  

**Example 18.4. **
pa | re | ci | vo | mu | xa | ze | bi | so | no  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
one | two | three | four | five | six | seven | eight | nine | zero  
1234567890  
one billion, two hundred and thirty-four million, five hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and ninety.  
---  
  

Therefore, there are no separate cmavo for “ten”, “hundred”, etc.
There is a pattern to the digit cmavo (except for __no__ , 0) which is worth explaining. The cmavo from 1 to 5 end in the vowels _a_ , _e_ , _i_ , _o_ , _u_ respectively; and the cmavo from 6 to 9 likewise end in the vowels _a_ , _e_ , _i_ , and _o_ respectively. None of the digit cmavo begin with the same consonant, to make them easy to tell apart in noisy environments.

## 18.8. Indefinite numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ro |  PA |  all  
---|---|---  
so'a |  PA |  almost all  
so'e |  PA |  most  
so'i |  PA |  many  
so'o |  PA |  several  
so'u |  PA |  a few  
no'o |  PA |  the typical number of  
da'a |  PA |  all but (one) of  
piro |  PA+PA |  the whole of/all of  
piso'a |  PA+PA |  almost the whole of  
piso'e |  PA+PA |  most of  
piso'i |  PA+PA |  much of  
piso'o |  PA+PA |  a small part of  
piso'u |  PA+PA |  a tiny part of  
pino'o |  PA+PA |  the typical portion of  
rau |  PA |  enough  
du'e |  PA |  too many  
mo'a |  PA |  too few  
pirau |  PA+PA |  enough of  
pidu'e |  PA+PA |  too much of  
pimo'a |  PA+PA |  too little of  
Not all the cmavo of PA represent numbers in the usual mathematical sense. For example, the cmavo __ro__ means “all” or “each”. This number does not have a definite value in the abstract: _li ro_ is undefined. But when used to count or quantify something, the parallel between __ro__ and __pa__ is clearer:
**Example 18.41. **
mi | catlu | pa | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | one | person  
  

**Example 18.42. **
mi | catlu | ro | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all | persons  
  

Example 18.41 might be true, whereas Example 18.42 is almost certainly false.
The cmavo __so'a__ , __so'e__ , __so'i__ , __so'o__ , and __so'u__ represent a set of indefinite numbers less than __ro__. As you go down an alphabetical list, the magnitude decreases:
**Example 18.43. **
mi | catlu | so'a | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | almost-all | persons  
  

**Example 18.44. **
mi | catlu | so'e | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | most | persons  
  

**Example 18.45. **
mi | catlu | so'i | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | many | persons  
  

**Example 18.46. **
mi | catlu | so'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | several | persons  
  

**Example 18.47. **
mi | catlu | so'u | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | a-few | persons  
  

The English equivalents are only rough: the cmavo provide space for up to five indefinite numbers between __ro__ and __no__ , with a built-in ordering. In particular, __so'e__ does not mean “most” in the sense of “a majority” or “more than half”.
Each of these numbers, plus __ro__ , may be prefixed with __pi__ (the decimal point) in order to make a fractional form which represents part of a whole rather than some elements of a totality. __piro__ therefore means “the whole of”:
**Example 18.48. **
mi | citka | piro | lei | nanba  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | eat | the-whole-of | the-mass-of | bread  
  

Similarly, __piso'a__ means “almost the whole of”; and so on down to __piso'u__ , “a tiny part of”. These numbers are particularly appropriate with masses, which are usually measured rather than counted, as Example 18.48 shows.
In addition to these cmavo, there is __no'o__ , meaning “the typical value”, and _pino'o_ , meaning “the typical portion”: Sometimes __no'o__ can be translated “the average value”, but the average in question is not, in general, a mathematical mean, median, or mode; these would be more appropriately represented by operators.
**Example 18.49. **
mi | catlu | no'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | a-typical-number-of | persons  
  

**Example 18.50. **
mi | citka | pino'o | lei | nanba  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | eat | a-typical-amount-of | the-mass-of | bread.  
  

__da'a__ is a related cmavo meaning “all but”:
**Example 18.51. **
mi | catlu | da'a | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all-but | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.52. **
mi | catlu | da'a | so'u | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all-but | a-few | persons  
  

Example 18.52 is similar in meaning to Example 18.43.
If no number follows __da'a__ , then __pa__ is assumed; __da'a__ by itself means “all but one”, or in ordinal contexts “all but the last”:
**Example 18.53. **
ro | ratcu | ka'e | citka | da'a | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | rats | can | eat | all-but-one | rats.  
All rats can eat all other rats.  
---  
  

(The use of __da'a__ means that Example 18.53 does not require that all rats can eat themselves, but does allow it. Each rat has one rat it cannot eat, but that one might be some rat other than itself. Context often dictates that “itself” is, indeed, the “other” rat.)
As mentioned in Section 18.3, __ma'u__ and __ni'u__ are also legal numbers, and they mean “some positive number” and “some negative number” respectively.
**Example 18.54. **
li | ci | vu'u | re | du | li | ma'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 3 | − | 2 | = |  | some-positive-number  
  

**Example 18.55. **
li | ci | vu'u | vo | du | li | ni'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 3 | − | 4 | = |  | some-negative-number  
  

**Example 18.56. **
mi | ponse | ma'u | rupnu  
---|---|---|---  
I | possess | a-positive-number-of | currency-units.  
  

All of the numbers discussed so far are objective, even if indefinite. If there are exactly six superpowers (_rairgugde_ , “superlative-states”) in the world, then _ro rairgugde_ means the same as _xa rairgugde_. It is often useful, however, to express subjective indefinite values. The cmavo __rau__ (enough), __du'e__ (too many), and __mo'a__ (too few) are then appropriate:
**Example 18.57. **
mi | ponse | rau | rupnu  
---|---|---|---  
I | possess | enough | currency-units.  
  

Like the __so'a__ -series, __rau__ , __du'e__ , and __mo'a__ can be preceded by __pi__ ; for example, _pirau_ means “a sufficient part of.”
Another possibility is that of combining definite and indefinite numbers into a single number. This usage implies that the two kinds of numbers have the same value in the given context:
**Example 18.58. **
mi | viska | le | rore | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | all-of/two | dogs.  
I saw both dogs.  
---  
  

**Example 18.59. **
mi | speni | so'ici | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | am-married-to | many/three | persons.  
I am married to three persons (which is “many” in the circumstances).  
---  
  

Example 18.59 assumes a mostly monogamous culture by stating that three is “many”.
