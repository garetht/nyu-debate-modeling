## 13.16. Tentative conclusion
The exact ramifications of the indicator system in actual usage are unknown. There has never been anything like it in natural language before. The system provides great potential for emotional expression and transcription, from which significant Sapir-Whorf effects can be anticipated. When communicating across cultural boundaries, where different indicators are often used for the same emotion, accidental offense can be avoided. If we ever ran into an alien race, a culturally neutral language of emotion could be vital. (A classic example, taken from the science fiction of Larry Niven, is to imagine speaking Lojban to the carnivorous warriors called Kzinti, noting that a human smile bares the teeth, and could be seen as an intent to attack.) And for communicating emotions to computers, when we cannot identify all of the signals involved in subliminal human communication (things like body language are also cultural), a system like this is needed.
We have tried to err on the side of overkill. There are distinctions possible in this system that no one may care to make in any culture. But it was deemed more neutral to overspecify and let usage decide, than to choose a limited set and constrain emotional expression. For circumstances in which even the current indicator set is not enough, it is possible using the cmavo __sei__ , explained in Section 19.12, to create metalinguistic comments that act like indicators.
We envision an evolutionary development. At this point, the system is little more than a mental toy. Many of you who read this will try playing around with various combinations of indicators, trying to figure out what emotions they express and when the expressions might be useful. You may even find an expression for which there currently is no good English word and start using it. Why not, if it helps you express your feelings?
There will be a couple dozen of these used pretty much universally – mostly just simple attitudinals with, at most, intensity markers. These are the ones that will quickly be expressed at the subconscious level. But every Lojbanist who plays with the list will bring in a couple of new words. Poets will paint emotional pictures, and people who identify with those pictures will use the words so created for their own experiences.
Just as a library of tanru is built up, so will a library of attitudes be built. Unlike the tanru, though, the emotional expressions are built on some fairly nebulous root emotions – words that cannot be defined with the precision of the gismu. The emotion words of Lojban will very quickly take on a life of their own, and the outline given here will evolve into a true system of emotions.
There are several theories as to the nature of emotion, and they change from year to year as we learn more about ourselves. Whether or not Lojban's additive/scalar emotional model is an accurate model for human emotions, it does support the linguistic needs for expressing those emotions. Researchers may learn more about the nature of human emotions by exploring the use of the system by Lojban speakers. They also may be able to use the Lojban system as a means for more clearly recording emotions.
The full list of scales and attitudes will probably not be used until someone speaks the language from birth. Until then, people will use the attitudes that are important to them. In this way, we counter cultural bias – if a culture is prone to recognizing and/or expressing certain emotions more than others, its members will use only those out of the enormous set available. If a culture hides certain emotions, its members simply won't express them.
Perhaps native Lojban speakers will be more expressively clear about their emotions than others. Perhaps they will feel some emotions more strongly than others in ways that can be correlated with the word choices; any difference from the norms of other cultures could be significant. Psychologists have devised elaborate tests for measuring attitudes and personality; this may be the easiest area in which to detect any systematic cultural effect of the type sought to confirm Sapir-Whorf, simply because we already have tools in existence to test it. Because Lojban is unique among languages in having such extensive and expressive indicators, it is likely that a Sapir-Whorf effect will occur and will be recognized.
It is unlikely that we will know the true potential of a system like this one until and unless we have children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking environment. We learn too many cultural habits in the realm of emotional communication “at our mother's knee”. Such children will have a Lojban system that has stronger reinforcement than any typical culture system. The second generation of such children, then, could be said to be the start of a true Lojbanic culture.
We shouldn't need to wait that long to detect significant effects. Emotion is so basic to our lives that even a small change or improvement in emotional communication would have immediately noticeable effects. Perhaps it will be the case that the most important contribution of our “logical language” will be in the non-logical realm of emotion!

## 7.15. lujvo based on pro-sumti
There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See Section 7.16 for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.
Thus __donta'a__ , meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted as _tavla be do_ , and would have the place structure
**Example 7.76. **
> t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
  

since `t2` (the addressee) is already known to be __do__.
On the other hand, the lujvo __donma'o__ , literally “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal pronoun”, would be interpreted as _cmavo be zo do_ , and have the place structure:
**Example 7.77. **
> c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
  

since both the `c2` place (the grammatical class) and the `c3` place (the meaning) are obvious from the context __do__.
An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the __fo'a__ series is to express lujvo which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An example would be:
**Example 7.78. **
fo'a | goi | le | kulnrsu,omi | .i | lo | fo'arselsanga  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x6 | stands-for | the | Finnish-culture | . | An | x6-song.  
  

Finally, lujvo involving __zi'o__ are also possible, and are fully discussed in Chapter 12. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for __zi'o__ as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a _se pinxe be zi'o_ , the lujvo corresponding to this is _zilrelselpinxe_ (deleting the second place of _se pinxe_). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that _zilpavypinxe_ has the same place structure as _zilrelselpinxe_ , and _lo zilpavypinxe_ , like _lo zilrelselpinxe_ , refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ , __du__ , and __bu'a__ also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for _du-_ based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.

## 18.17. Logical and non-logical connectives within mekso
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
.abu |  BY |  letter “a”  
---|---|---  
by |  BY |  letter “b”  
cy |  BY |  letter “c”  
fe'a |  VUhU |  nth root of (default square root)  
lo'o |  LOhO |  terminator for LI  
As befits a logical language, Lojban has extensive provision for logical connectives within both operators and operands. Full details on logical and non-logical connectives are provided in Chapter 14. Operands are connected in afterthought with selma'o A and in forethought with selma'o GA, just like sumti. Operators are connected in afterthought with selma'o JA and in forethought with selma'o GUhA, just like tanru components. This parallelism is no accident.
In addition, A+BO and A+KE constructs are allowed for grouping logically connected operands, and __ke__ … __ke'e__ is allowed for grouping logically connected operators, although there are no analogues of tanru among the operators.
Despite the large number of rules required to support this feature, it is of relatively minor importance in the mekso scheme of things. Example 18.114 exhibits afterthought logical connection between operands:
**Example 18.114. **
vei | ci | .a | vo | ve'o | prenu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | Three | or | four | ) | people |  | go | to-the | market.  
  

Example 18.115 is equivalent in meaning, but uses forethought connection:
**Example 18.115. **
vei | ga | ci | gi | vo | ve'o | prenu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | Either | 3 | or | 4 | ) | people |  | go | to-the | market.  
  

Note that the mekso here are being used as quantifiers. Lojban requires that any mekso other than a simple number be enclosed in parentheses when used as a quantifier. This rule prevents ambiguities that do not exist when using __li__.
By the way, __li__ has an elidable terminator, __lo'o__ , which is needed when a __li__ sumti is followed by a logical connective that could seem to be within the mekso. For example:
**Example 18.116. **
li | re | su'i | re | du  
---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | two | plus | two | equals  
li | vo | lo'o | .onai | lo | nalseldjuno | namcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | four |  | or-else | a | non-known | number.  
  

Omitting the __lo'o__ would cause the parser to assume that another operand followed the __.onai__ and reject __lo__ as an invalid operand.
Simple examples of logical connection between operators are hard to come by. A contrived example is:
**Example 18.117. **
li | re | su'i | je | pi'i | re | du | li | vo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | two | plus | and | times | two | equals | the-number | four.  
2 + 2 = 4 and 2 × 2 = 4.  
  

The forethought-connection form of Example 18.117 is:
**Example 18.118. **
li | re | ge | su'i | gi | pi'i | re | du | li | vo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | two | both | plus | and | times | two | equals | the-number | four.  
Both 2 + 2 = 4 and 2 × 2 = 4.  
  

Here is a classic example of operand logical connection:
**Example 18.119. **
go | li | .abu | bi'epi'i | vei | xy. | te'a | re | ve'o | su'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
If-and-only-if | the-number |  “a” | times | ( |  “x” | power | two | ) | plus  
by. | bi'epi'i | xy. | su'i | cy. | du | li | no  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
“b” | times |  “x” | plus |  “c” | equals | the-number | zero  
gi | li | xy. | du | li | vei | va'a | by. | ku'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | the-number | x | equals | the-number | [ | the-negation-of( | b | )  
su'i | ja | vu'u | fe'a  
---|---|---|---  
plus | or | minus | the-root-of  
vei | by. | bi'ete'a | re | vu'u | vo | bi'epi'i | .abu | bi'epi'i | cy.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( |  “b” | power | 2 | minus | four | times |  “a” | times |  “c”  
ve'o | [ku'e] | ve'o | fe'i | re | bi'epi'i | .abu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
) |  | ] | divided-by | two | times |  “a”  
Iff  a x 2 + b x + c = 0 , then  x = - b ± b 2 - 4 a c 2 a  
  

Note the mixture of styles in Example 18.119: the negation of b and the square root are represented by forethought and most of the operator precedence by prefixed __bi'e__ , but explicit parentheses had to be added to group the numerator properly. In addition, the square root parentheses cannot be removed here in favor of simple __fe'a__ and __ku'e__ bracketing, because infix operators are present in the operand. Getting Example 18.119 to parse perfectly using the current parser took several tries: a more relaxed style would dispense with most of the __bi'e__ cmavo and just let the standard precedence rules be understood.
Non-logical connection with JOI and BIhI is also permitted between operands and between operators. One use for this construct is to connect operands with __bi'o__ to create intervals:
**Example 18.120. **
li | no | ga'o | bi'o | ke'i | pa  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | zero | (inclusive) | from-to | (exclusive) | one  
[0,1)  
the numbers from zero to one, including zero but not including one  
---  
  

Intervals defined by a midpoint and range rather than beginning and end points can be expressed by __mi'i__ :
**Example 18.121. **
li | pimu | ga'o | mi'i | ke'i | pimu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 0.5 | (inclusive) | centered-with-range | (exclusive) | 0.5  
  

which expresses the same interval as Example 18.120. Note that the __ga'o__ and __ke'i__ still refer to the endpoints, although these are now implied rather than expressed. Another way of expressing the same thing:
**Example 18.122. **
li | pimu | su'i | ni'upimu | bi'o | ke'i | ma'upimu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 0.5 | plus | [-0.5 | from-to | (exclusive) | +0.5]  
  

Here we have the sum of a number and an interval, which produces another interval centered on the number. As Example 18.122 shows, non-logical (or logical) connection of operands has higher precedence than any mekso operator.
You can also combine two operands with __ce'o__ , the sequence connective of selma'o JOI, to make a compound subscript:
**Example 18.123. **
xy. | xi | vei | by. | ce'o | dy. | [ve'o]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
“x” | sub | ( |  “b” | sequence |  “d” | )  
xb,d

## 18.5. Simple infix expressions and equations
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
du |  GOhA |  equals  
---|---|---  
su'i |  VUhU |  plus  
vu'u |  VUhU |  minus  
pi'i |  VUhU |  times  
te'a |  VUhU |  raised to the power  
ny. |  BY |  letter “n”  
vei |  VEI |  left parenthesis  
ve'o |  VEhO |  right parenthesis  
Let us begin at the beginning: one plus one equals two. In Lojban, that sentence translates to:
**Example 18.22. **
li | pa | su'i | pa | du | li | re  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | one | plus | one | equals | the-number | two.  
1 + 1 = 2  
  

Example 18.22, a mekso sentence, is a regular Lojban bridi that exploits mekso features. __du__ is the predicate meaning “x1 is mathematically equal to x2”. It is a cmavo for conciseness, but it has the same grammatical uses as any brivla. Outside mathematical contexts, __du__ means “x1 is identical with x2” or “x1 is the same object as x2”.
The cmavo __li__ is the number article. It is required whenever a sentence talks about numbers as numbers, as opposed to using numbers to quantify things. For example:
**Example 18.23. **
le | ci | prenu  
---|---|---  
the three persons  
---  
  

requires no __li__ article, because the __ci__ is being used to specify the number of __prenu__. However, the sentence
**Example 18.24. **
levi | sfani | cu | grake | li | ci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | fly |  | masses-in-grams | the-number | three.  
This fly has a mass of 3 grams.  
---  
  

requires __li__ because __ci__ is being used as a sumti. Note that this is the way in which measurements are stated in Lojban: all the predicates for units of length, mass, temperature, and so on have the measured object as the first place and a number as the second place. Using __li__ for __le__ in Example 18.23 would produce
**Example 18.25. **
li | ci | prenu  
---|---|---  
The-number | 3 | is-a-person.  
  

which is grammatical but nonsensical: numbers are not persons.
The cmavo __su'i__ belongs to selma'o VUhU, which is composed of mathematical operators, and means “addition”. As mentioned before, it is distinct from __ma'u__ which means the positive sign as an indication of a positive number:
**Example 18.26. **
li | ma'u | pa | su'i  
---|---|---|---  
The-number | positive-sign | one | plus  
ni'u | pa | du | li | no  
---|---|---|---|---  
negative-sign | one | equals | the-number | zero.  
+1 + -1 = 0  
  

Of course, it is legal to have complex mekso on both sides of __du__ :
**Example 18.27. **
li | mu | su'i | pa | du | li | ci | su'i | ci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | five | plus | one | equals | the-number | three | plus | three.  
5 + 1 = 3 + 3  
  

Why don't we say _li mu su'i li pa_ rather than just _li mu su'i pa_? The answer is that VUhU operators connect mekso operands (numbers, in Example 18.27), not general sumti. __li__ is used to make the entire mekso into a sumti, which then plays the roles applicable to other sumti: in Example 18.27, filling the places of a bridi
By default, Lojban mathematics is like simple calculator mathematics: there is no notion of “operator precedence”. Consider the following example, where __pi'i__ means “times”, the multiplication operator:
**Example 18.28. **
li | ci | su'i | vo | pi'i | mu | du | li | reci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | three | plus | four | times | five | equals | the-number | two-three.  
3 + 4 × 5 = 23  
  

Is the Lojban version of Example 18.28 true? No! “3 + 4 × 5” is indeed 23, because the usual conventions of mathematics state that multiplication takes precedence over addition; that is, the multiplication “4 × 5” is done first, giving 20, and only then the addition “3 + 20”. But VUhU operators by default are done left to right, like other Lojban grouping, and so a truthful bridi would be:
**Example 18.29. **
li | ci | su'i | vo | pi'i | mu | du | li | cimu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | three | plus | four | times | five | equals | the-number | three-five.  
3 + 4 × 5 = 35  
  

Here we calculate 3 + 4 first, giving 7, and then calculate 7 × 5 second, leading to the result 35. While possessing the advantage of simplicity, this result violates the design goal of matching the standards of mathematics. What can be done?
There are three solutions, all of which will probably be used to some degree. The first solution is to ignore the problem. People will say _li ci su'i vo pi'i mu_ and mean 23 by it, because the notion that multiplication takes precedence over addition is too deeply ingrained to be eradicated by Lojban parsing, which totally ignores semantics. This convention essentially allows semantics to dominate syntax in this one area.
(Why not hard-wire the precedences into the grammar, as is done in computer programming languages? Essentially because there are too many operators, known and unknown, with levels of precedence that vary according to usage. The programming language 'C' has 13 levels of precedence, and its list of operators is not even extensible. For Lojban this approach is just not practical. In addition, hard-wired precedence could not be overridden in mathematical systems such as spreadsheets where the conventions are different.)
The second solution is to use explicit means to specify the precedence of operators. This approach is fully general, but clumsy, and will be explained in Section 18.20.
The third solution is simple but not very general. When an operator is prefixed with the cmavo __bi'e__ (of selma'o BIhE), it becomes automatically of higher precedence than other operators not so prefixed. Thus,
**Example 18.30. **
li | ci | su'i | vo | bi'e | pi'i | mu | du | li | reci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | three | plus | four | times | five | equals | the-number | two-three.  
3 + 4 × 5 = 23  
  

is a truthful Lojban bridi. If more than one operator has a __bi'e__ prefix, grouping is from the right; multiple __bi'e__ prefixes on a single operator are not allowed.
In addition, of course, Lojban has the mathematical parentheses __vei__ and __ve'o__ , which can be used just like their written equivalents “(” and “)” to group expressions in any way desired:
**Example 18.31. **
li | vei | ny. | su'i | pa | ve'o | pi'i | vei | ny. | su'i | pa | [ve'o]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | ( |  `n` | plus | one | ) | times | ( |  `n` | plus | one | )  
du | li | ny. | [bi'e] | te'a | re  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
equals | the-number | n |  | to-the-power | two  
su'i | re | bi'e | pi'i | ny. | su'i | pa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
plus | two |  | times |  `n` | plus | 1.  
(n+1)(n+1) = n2 \+ 2n + 1  
  

There are several new usages in Example 18.31: __te'a__ means “raised to the power”, and we also see the use of the lerfu word __ny__ , representing the letter “n”. In mekso, letters stand for just what they do in ordinary mathematics: variables. The parser will accept a string of lerfu words (called a “lerfu string”) as the equivalent of a single lerfu word, in agreement with computer-science conventions; “abc” is a single variable, not the equivalent of “a × b × c”. (Of course, a local convention could state that the value of a variable like “abc”, with a multi-lerfu name, was equal to the values of the variables “a”, “b”, and “c” multiplied together.)
The explicit operator __pi'i__ is required in the Lojban verbal form whereas multiplication is implicit in the symbolic form. Note that __ve'o__ (the right parenthesis) is an elidable terminator: the first use of it in Example 18.31 is required, but the second use (marked by square brackets) could be elided. Additionally, the first __bi'e__ (also marked by square brackets) is not necessary to get the proper grouping, but it is included here for symmetry with the other one.

## 6.15. Number summary
The sumti which refer to numbers consist of the cmavo __li__ (of selma'o LI) followed by an arbitrary Lojban mekso, or mathematical expression. This can be anything from a simple number up to the most complicated combination of numbers, variables, operators, and so on. Much more information on numbers is given in Chapter 18. Here are a few examples of increasing complexity:
**Example 6.95. **
li | vo  
---|---  
the-number | four  
4  
  

**Example 6.96. **
li | re | su'i | re  
---|---|---|---  
the-number | two | plus | two  
2 + 2  
  

**Example 6.97. **
li | .abu | bi'epi'i | xy. | bi'ete'a | re | su'i | by. | bi'epi'i | xy. | su'i | cy.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | a | times | x | to-power | 2 | plus | b | times | x | plus | c  
ax2 \+ bx + c  
  

An alternative to __li__ is __me'o__ , also of selma'o LI. Number expressions beginning with __me'o__ refer to the actual expression, rather than its value. Thus Example 6.95 and Example 6.96 above have the same meaning, the number four, whereas
**Example 6.98. **
me'o | vo  
---|---  
the-expression | four  
“4”  
---  
  

and
**Example 6.99. **
me'o | re | su'i | re  
---|---|---|---  
the-expression | two | plus | two  
“2+2”  
---  
  

refer to different pieces of text.
The implicit quantifier for numbers and mathematical expressions is __su'o__ , because these sumti are analogous to __lo__ descriptions: they refer to things which actually are numbers or pieces of text. In the case of numbers (with __li__), this is a distinction without a difference, as there is only one number which is 4; but there are many texts “4”, as many as there are documents in which that numeral appears.

## 18.9. Approximation and inexact numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ji'i |  PA |  approximately  
---|---|---  
su'e |  PA |  at most  
su'o |  PA |  at least  
me'i |  PA |  less than  
za'u |  PA |  more than  
The cmavo __ji'i__ (of selma'o PA) is used in several ways to indicate approximate or rounded numbers. If it appears at the beginning of a number, the whole number is approximate:
**Example 18.60. **
ji'i | vo | no  
---|---|---  
approximation | four | zero  
approximately 40  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears in the middle of a number, all the digits following it are approximate:
**Example 18.61. **
vo | no | ji'i | mu | no  
---|---|---|---|---  
four | zero | approximation | five | zero  
roughly 4050 (where the “four thousand” is exact, but the “fifty” is approximate)  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears at the end of a number, it indicates that the number has been rounded. In addition, it can then be followed by a sign cmavo (__ma'u__ or __ni'u__), which indicate truncation towards positive or negative infinity respectively.
**Example 18.62. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation  
2.72 (rounded)  
---  
  

**Example 18.63. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i | ma'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation | positive-sign  
2.72 (rounded up)  
---  
  

**Example 18.64. **
re | pi | ze | pa | ji'i | ni'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | one | approximation | negative-sign  
2.71 (rounded down)  
---  
  

Example 18.62 through Example 18.64 are all approximations to __te'o__ (exponential e). __ji'i__ can also appear by itself, in which case it means “approximately the typical value in this context”.
The four cmavo __su'e__ , __su'o__ , __me'i__ , and __za'u__ , also of selma'o PA, express inexact numbers with upper or lower bounds:
**Example 18.65. **
mi | catlu | su'e | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-most | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.66. **
mi | catlu | su'o | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.67. **
mi | catlu | me'i | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | less-than | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.68. **
mi | catlu | za'u | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | more-than | two | persons  
  

Each of these is a subtly different claim: Example 18.66 is true of two or any greater number, whereas Example 18.68 requires three persons or more. Likewise, Example 18.65 refers to zero, one, or two; Example 18.67 to zero or one. (Of course, when the context allows numbers other than non-negative integers, _me'i re_ can be any number less than 2, and likewise with the other cases.) The exact quantifier, “exactly 2, neither more nor less” is just __re__. Note that _su'ore_ is the exact Lojban equivalent of English plurals.
If no number follows one of these cmavo, __pa__ is understood: therefore,
**Example 18.69. **
mi | catlu | su'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least-[one] | person  
  

is a meaningful claim.
Like the numbers in Section 18.8, all of these cmavo may be preceded by __pi__ to make the corresponding quantifiers for part of a whole. For example, __pisu'o__ means “at least some part of”. The quantifiers __ro__ , __su'o__ , __piro__ , and __pisu'o__ are particularly important in Lojban, as they are implicitly used in the descriptions introduced by the cmavo of selma'o LA and LE, as explained in Section 6.7. Descriptions in general are outside the scope of this chapter.

## 18.9. Approximation and inexact numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ji'i |  PA |  approximately  
---|---|---  
su'e |  PA |  at most  
su'o |  PA |  at least  
me'i |  PA |  less than

The cmavo __ji'i__ (of selma'o PA) is used in several ways to indicate approximate or rounded numbers. If it appears at the beginning of a number, the whole number is approximate:
**Example 18.60. **
ji'i | vo | no  
---|---|---

approximately 40  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears in the middle of a number, all the digits following it are approximate:
**Example 18.61. **
vo | no | ji'i | mu | no  
---|---|---|---|---  
four | zero | approximation | five | zero  
roughly 4050 (where the “four thousand” is exact, but the “fifty” is approximate)  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears at the end of a number, it indicates that the number has been rounded. In addition, it can then be followed by a sign cmavo (__ma'u__ or __ni'u__), which indicate truncation towards positive or negative infinity respectively.
**Example 18.62. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation  
2.72 (rounded)  
---  
  

**Example 18.63. **

---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | one | approximation | negative-sign  
2.71 (rounded down)

Example 18.62 through Example 18.64 are all approximations to __te'o__ (exponential e). __ji'i__ can also appear by itself, in which case it means “approximately the typical value in this context”.
The four cmavo __su'e__ , __su'o__ , __me'i__ , and __za'u__ , also of selma'o PA, express inexact numbers with upper or lower bounds:
**Example 18.65. **

I | look-at | at-least | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.67. **
mi | catlu | me'i | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | less-than | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.68. **
mi | catlu | za'u | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | more-than | two | persons  
  

Each of these is a subtly different claim: Example 18.66 is true of two or any greater number, whereas Example 18.68 requires three persons or more. Likewise, Example 18.65 refers to zero, one, or two; Example 18.67 to zero or one. (Of course, when the context allows numbers other than non-negative integers, _me'i re_ can be any number less than 2, and likewise with the other cases.) The exact quantifier, “exactly 2, neither more nor less” is just __re__. Note that _su'ore_ is the exact Lojban equivalent of English plurals.
If no number follows one of these cmavo, __pa__ is understood: therefore,
**Example 18.69. **
mi | catlu | su'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least-[one] | person  
  

is a meaningful claim.
Like the numbers in Section 18.8, all of these cmavo may be preceded by __pi__ to make the corresponding quantifiers for part of a whole. For example, __pisu'o__ means “at least some part of”. The quantifiers __ro__ , __su'o__ , __piro__ , and __pisu'o__ are particularly important in Lojban, as they are implicitly used in the descriptions introduced by the cmavo of selma'o LA and LE, as explained in Section 6.7. Descriptions in general are outside the scope of this chapter.

## 6.6. Quantified sumti
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ro |  PA |  all of/each of  
---|---|---  
su'o |  PA |  at least (one of)  
Quantifiers tell us how many: in the case of quantifiers with sumti, how many things we are talking about. In Lojban, quantifiers are expressed by numbers and mathematical expressions: a large topic discussed in some detail in Chapter 18. For the purposes of this chapter, a simplified treatment will suffice. Our examples will employ either the simple Lojban numbers __pa__ , __re__ , __ci__ , __vo__ , and __mu__ , meaning “one”, “two”, “three”, “four”, “five” respectively, or else one of four special quantifiers, two of which are discussed in this section and listed above. These four quantifiers are important because every Lojban sumti has either one or two of them implicitly present in it – which one or two depends on the particular kind of sumti. There is more explanation of implicit quantifiers later in this section. (The other two quantifiers, __piro__ and __pisu'o__ , are explained in Section 6.7.)
Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit quantifier. The purpose of this quantifier is to specify how many of the things referred to by the sumti are being talked about. Here are some simple examples contrasting sumti with and without explicit quantifiers:
**Example 6.30. **
do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---  
You | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

**Example 6.31. **
re | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
Two-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

The difference between Example 6.30 and Example 6.31 is the presence of the explicit quantifier __re__ in the latter example. Although __re__ by itself means “two”, when used as a quantifier it means “two-of”. Out of the group of listeners (the number of which isn't stated), two (we are not told which ones) are asserted to be “walkers on the ice”. Implicitly, the others (if any) are not walkers on the ice. In Lojban, you cannot say “I own three shoes” if in fact you own four shoes. Numbers need never be specified, but if they are specified they must be correct.
(This rule does not mean that there is no way to specify a number which is vague. The sentence
**Example 6.32. **
mi | ponse | su'o | ci | cutci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | at-least | three | shoes.  
  

is true if you own three shoes, or four, or indeed any larger number. More details on vague numbers appear in the discussion of mathematical expressions in Chapter 18.)
Now consider Example 6.30 again. How many of the listeners are claimed to walk on the ice? The answer turns out to be: all of them, however many that is. So Example 6.30 and Example 6.33:
**Example 6.33. **
ro | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
All-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

turn out to mean exactly the same thing. This is a safe strategy, because if one of my listeners doesn't turn out to be walking on the ice, I can safely claim that I didn't intend that person to be a listener! And in fact, all of the personal pro-sumti such as __mi__ and __mi'o__ and __ko__ obey the same rule. We say that personal pro-sumti have a so-called “implicit quantifier” of __ro__ (all). This just means that if no quantifier is given explicitly, the meaning is the same as if the implicit quantifier had been used.
Not all sumti have __ro__ as the implicit quantifier, however. Consider the quotation in:
**Example 6.34. **
mi | cusku | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say, “You walk on the ice.”  
---  
  

What is the implicit quantifier of the quotation _lu do cadzu le bisli li'u_? Surely not __ro__. If __ro__ were supplied explicitly, thus:
**Example 6.35. **
mi | cusku | ro | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | all-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

the meaning would be something like “I say every occurrence of the sentence 'You walk on the ice'”. Of course I don't say every occurrence of it, only some occurrences. One might suppose that Example 6.34 means that I express exactly one occurrence, but it is more Lojbanic to leave the number unspecified, as with other sumti. We can say definitely, however, that I say it at least once.
The Lojban cmavo meaning “at least” is __su'o__ , and if no ordinary number follows, __su'o__ means “at least once”. (See Example 6.32 for the use of __su'o__ with an ordinary number). Therefore, the explicitly quantified version of Example 6.34 is
**Example 6.36. **
mi | cusku | su'o | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | at-least-one-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say one or more instances of “You walk on the ice”.  
---  
I say “You walk on the ice”.  
  

If an explicit ordinary number such as __re__ were to appear, it would have to convey an exact expression, so
**Example 6.37. **
mi | cusku | re | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | two-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

means that I say the sentence exactly twice, neither more nor less.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 16.11. Using _naku_ outside a prenex
Let us consider the English sentence
**Example 16.79. **
Some children do not go to school.
  

We cannot express this directly with __na__ ; the apparently obvious translation
**Example 16.80. **
su'oda | poi | verba  
---|---|---  
At-least-one-X | which-are | child(ren)  
na | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
[false] | go-to | at-least-one-Y | which-are | school(s).  
  

when converted to the external negation form produces:
**Example 16.81. **
naku | zo'u | su'oda | poi | verba | cu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
It-is-false | that | some-which | are | children |   
klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---  
go-to | some-which | are | schools.  
All children don't go to some school (not just some children).  
---  
  

Lojban provides a negation form which more closely emulates natural language negation. This involves putting _naku_ before the selbri, instead of a __na__. _naku_ is clearly a contradictory negation, given its parallel with prenex bridi negation. Using _naku_ , Example 16.79 can be expressed as:
**Example 16.82. **
su'oda | poi | verba | naku | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | which-are | children | don't | go-to | some | which-are | schools.  
Some children don't go to a school.  
---  
  

Although it is not technically a sumti, _naku_ can be used in most of the places where a sumti may appear. We'll see what this means in a moment.
When you use _naku_ within a bridi, you are explicitly creating a negation boundary. As explained in Section 16.9, when a prenex negation boundary expressed by _naku_ moves past a quantifier, the quantifier has to be inverted. The same is true for _naku_ in the bridi proper. We can move _naku_ to any place in the sentence where a sumti can go, inverting any quantifiers that the negation boundary crosses. Thus, the following are equivalent to Example 16.82 (no good English translations exist):
**Example 16.83. **
su'oda | poi | verba | cu | klama | rode | poi | ckule | naku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For some children, for every school, they don't go to it.  
---  
  

**Example 16.84. **
su'oda | poi | verba | cu | klama | naku | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some children don't go to (some) school(s).  
---  
  

**Example 16.85. **
naku | roda | poi | verba | cu | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is false that all children go to some school(s).  
---  
  

In Example 16.83, we moved the negation boundary rightward across the quantifier of __de__ , forcing us to invert it. In Example 16.85 we moved the negation boundary across the quantifier of __da__ , forcing us to invert it instead. Example 16.84 merely switched the selbri and the negation boundary, with no effect on the quantifiers.
The same rules apply if you rearrange the sentence so that the quantifier crosses an otherwise fixed negation. You can't just convert the selbri of Example 16.82 and rearrange the sumti to produce
**Example 16.86. **
su'ode | poi | ckule | ku'o | naku | se | klama | roda | poi | verba  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some schools aren't gone-to-by every child.  
---  
  

or rather, Example 16.86 means something completely different from Example 16.82. Conversion with __se__ under _naku_ negation is not symmetric; not all sumti are treated identically, and some sumti are not invariant under conversion. Thus, internal negation with _naku_ is considered an advanced technique, used to achieve stylistic compatibility with natural languages.
It isn't always easy to see which quantifiers have to be inverted in a sentence. Example 16.82 is identical in meaning to:
**Example 16.87. **
su'o | verba | naku | klama | su'o | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | children | don't | go-to | some | school.  
  

but in Example 16.87, the bound variables __da__ and __de__ have been hidden.
It is trivial to export an internal bridi negation expressed with __na__ to the prenex, as we saw in Section 16.9; you just move it to the left end of the prenex. In comparison, it is non-trivial to export a _naku_ to the prenex because of the quantifiers. The rules for exporting _naku_ require that you export all of the quantified variables (implicit or explicit) along with _naku_ , and you must export them from left to right, in the same order that they appear in the sentence. Thus Example 16.82 goes into prenex form as:
**Example 16.88. **
su'oda | poi | verba | ku'o | naku  
---|---|---|---|---  
For-some-X | which | is-a-child, |  | it-is-not-the-case-that  
su'ode | poi | ckule | zo'u | da | klama | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-is-a-Y | which | is-a-school | such-that: | X | goes | to | Y.  
  

We can now move the _naku_ to the left end of the prenex, getting a contradictory negation that can be expressed with __na__ :
**Example 16.89. **
naku | roda | poi | verba  
---|---|---|---  
It-is-not-the-case-that | for-all-X's | which-are | children,  
su'ode | poi | ckule | zo'u | da | klama | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-is-a-Y | which-is | a-school | such-that: | X | goes-to | Y.  
  

from which we can restore the quantified variables to the sentence, giving:
**Example 16.90. **
naku | zo'u | roda | poi | verba | cu | klama | su'ode | poi | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
It is not the case that all children go to some school.  
---  
  

or more briefly
**Example 16.91. **
ro | verba | cu | na | klama | su'o | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | children |  | [false] | go-to | some | school(s).  
  

As noted in Section 16.5, a sentence with two different quantified variables, such as Example 16.91, cannot always be converted with __se__ without first exporting the quantified variables. When the variables have been exported, the sentence proper can be converted, but the quantifier order in the prenex must remain unchanged:
**Example 16.92. **
roda | poi | verba | su'ode  
---|---|---|---  
for-all-X's | which-are | children, | there-is-a-Y  
poi | ckule | zo'u | de | na | se | klama | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
which | is-a-school | such-that: | Y |  |  | is-gone-to-by | X.  
  

While you can't freely convert with __se__ when you have two quantified variables in a sentence, you can still freely move sumti to either side of the selbri, as long as the order isn't changed. If you use __na__ negation in such a sentence, nothing special need be done. If you use _naku_ negation, then quantified variables that cross the negation boundary must be inverted.
Clearly, if all of Lojban negation was built on _naku_ negation instead of __na__ negation, logical manipulation in Lojban would be as difficult as in natural languages. In Section 16.12, for example, we'll discuss DeMorgan's Law, which must be used whenever a sumti with a logical connection is moved across a negation boundary.
Since _naku_ has the grammar of a sumti, it can be placed almost anywhere a sumti can go, including __be__ and __bei__ clauses; it isn't clear what these mean, and we recommend avoiding such constructs.
You can put multiple _naku_ compounds in a sentence, each forming a separate negation boundary. Two adjacent _naku_ compounds in a bridi are a double negative and cancel out:
**Example 16.93. **
mi naku naku le zarci cu klama
  

Other expressions using two _naku_ compounds may or may not cancel out. If there is no quantified variable between them, then the _naku_ compounds cancel.
Negation with internal _naku_ is clumsy and non-intuitive for logical manipulations, but then, so are the natural language features it is emulating.

## 8.10. Relative clauses within relative clauses
For the most part, these are straightforward and uncomplicated: a sumti that is part of a relative clause bridi may itself be modified by a relative clause:
**Example 8.81. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | blanu | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | is-blue |  | is-slow.  
  

However, an ambiguity can exist if __ke'a__ is used in a relative clause within a relative clause: does it refer to the outermost sumti, or to the sumti within the outer relative clause to which the inner relative clause is attached? The latter. To refer to the former, use a subscript on __ke'a__ :
**Example 8.82. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'axire | zbasu | ke'a | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | IT-sub-2 | built | IT |  | is-slow.  
The person who is in the room which he built is slow.  
---  
  

Here, the meaning of “IT-sub-2” is that sumti attached to the second relative clause, counting from the innermost, is used. Therefore, _ke'axipa_ (IT-sub-1) means the same as plain __ke'a__.
Alternatively, you can use a prenex (explained in full in Chapter 16), which is syntactically a series of sumti followed by the special cmavo __zo'u__ , prefixed to the relative clause bridi:
**Example 8.83. **
le | prenu | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'a | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | who | (IT | = | it1 | :  
ko'a | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'e | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | is-in | the | room | which | (IT | = | it2 | :  
ko'a | zbasu | ko'e | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | built | it2) |  | is-slow.  
  

Example 8.83 is more verbose than Example 8.82, but may be clearer, since it explicitly spells out the two __ke'a__ cmavo, each on its own level, and assigns them to the assignable cmavo __ko'a__ and __ko'e__ (explained in Section 7.5).

## 11.10. Lojban sumti raising
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
tu'a |  LAhE |  an abstraction involving  
---|---|---  
jai |  JAI |  abstraction conversion  
It is sometimes inconvenient, in a situation where an abstract description is logically required, to express the abstraction. In English we can say:
**Example 11.64. **
I try to open the door.
  

which in Lojban is:
**Example 11.65. **
mi | troci | le | nu | [mi] | gasnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | try | the | event-of | (I | am-agent-in  
le | nu | le | vorme | cu | karbi'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | (the | door |  | open-becomes)).  
  

which has an abstract description within an abstract description, quite a complex structure. In English (but not in all other languages), we may also say:
**Example 11.66. **
I try the door.
  

where it is understood that what I try is actually not the door itself, but the act of opening it. The same simplification can be done in Lojban, but it must be marked explicitly using a cmavo. The relevant cmavo is __tu'a__ , which belongs to selma'o LAhE. The Lojban equivalent of Example 11.66 is:
**Example 11.67. **
mi | troci | tu'a | le | vorme  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | try | some-action-to-do-with | the | door.  
  

The term “sumti-raising”, as in the title of this section, signifies that a sumti which logically belongs within an abstraction (or even within an abstraction which is itself inside an intermediate abstraction) is “raised” to the main bridi level. This transformation from Example 11.65 to Example 11.67 loses information: nothing except convention tells us what the abstraction was.
Using __tu'a__ is a kind of laziness: it makes speaking easier at the possible expense of clarity for the listener. The speaker must be prepared for the listener to respond something like:
**Example 11.68. **
tu'a | le | vorme | lu'u | ki'a  
---|---|---|---|---  
something-to-do-with | the | door | [terminator] | [confusion!]  
  

which indicates that _tu'a le vorme_ cannot be understood. (The terminator for __tu'a__ is __lu'u__ , and is used in Example 11.68 to make clear just what is being questioned: the sumti-raising, rather than the word __vorme__ as such.) An example of a confusing raised sumti might be:
**Example 11.69. **
tu'a | la | djan. | cu | cafne  
---|---|---|---|---  
something-to-do-with | that-named | John |  | frequently-occurs  
  

This must mean that something which John does, or which happens to John, occurs frequently: but without more context there is no way to figure out what. Note that without the __tu'a__ , Example 11.69 would mean that John considered as an event frequently occurs – in other words, that John has some sort of on-and-off existence! Normally we do not think of people as events in English, but the x1 place of __cafne__ is an event, and if something that does not seem to be an event is put there, the Lojbanic listener will attempt to construe it as one. (Of course, this analysis assumes that _djan._ is the name of a person, and not the name of some event.)
Logically, a counterpart of some sort is needed to __tu'a__ which transposes an abstract sumti into a concrete one. This is achieved at the selbri level by the cmavo __jai__ (of selma'o JAI). This cmavo has more than one function, discussed in Section 9.12 and Section 10.22; for the purposes of this chapter, it operates as a conversion of selbri, similarly to the cmavo of selma'o SE. This conversion changes
**Example 11.70. **
tu'a | mi | rinka | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
something-to-do-with | me | causes | the | event-of | you | are-dead  
My action causes your death.  
---  
  

into
**Example 11.71. **
mi | jai | rinka | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-associated-with | causing | the | event-of | your | death.  
I cause your death.  
---  
  

In English, the subject of “cause” can either be the actual cause (an event), or else the agent of the cause (a person, typically); not so in Lojban, where the x1 of __rinka__ is always an event. Example 11.70 and Example 11.71 look equally convenient (or inconvenient), but in making descriptions, Example 11.71 can be altered to:
**Example 11.72. **
le | jai | rinka | be | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-which-is | associated-with | causing | ( | the | event-of | your | death | )  
the one who caused your death  
---  
  

because __jai__ modifies the selbri and can be incorporated into the description – not so for __tu'a__.
The weakness of __jai__ used in descriptions in this way is that it does not specify which argument of the implicit abstraction is being raised into the x1 place of the description selbri. One can be more specific by using the modal form of __jai__ explained in Section 9.12:
**Example 11.73. **
le | jai gau | rinka | be | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-which-is | agent-in | causing | ( | the | event-of | your | death | )

## 9.14. Sticky modals
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
ki |  KI |  stickiness flag  
---|---|---  
Like tenses, modals can be made persistent from the bridi in which they appear to all following bridi. The effect of this “stickiness” is to make the modal, along with its following sumti, act as if it appeared in every successive bridi. Stickiness is put into effect by following the modal (but not any following sumti) with the cmavo __ki__ of selma'o KI. For example,
**Example 9.88. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban. | bai  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban | compelled-by  
ki | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
| some-property-of | that-named | Frank.  
.ibabo | mi | tavla | bau | la | gliban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Afterward, | I | speak | in-language | that-named | English.  
  

means the same as:
**Example 9.89. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban. | bai  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban | compelled-by  
tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---  
some-property-of | that-named | Frank.  
.ibabo | mi | tavla | bau | la | gliban. | bai  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Afterward, | I | speak | in-language | that-named | English | compelled-by  
tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---  
some-property-of | that-named | Frank.  
  

In Example 9.88, __bai__ is made sticky, and so Frank's compelling is made applicable to every following bridi. __bau__ is not sticky, and so the language may vary from bridi to bridi, and if not specified in a particular bridi, no assumption can safely be made about its value.
To cancel stickiness, use the form _BAI ki ku_ , which stops any modal value for the specified BAI from being passed to the next bridi. To cancel stickiness for all modals simultaneously, and also for any sticky tenses that exist (__ki__ is used for both modals and tenses), use __ki__ by itself, either before the selbri or (in the form _ki ku_) anywhere in the bridi:
**Example 9.90. **
mi | ki | tavla  
---|---|---  
I speak (no implication about language or compulsion).  
---  
  

Note: Modals made with __fi'o__ -plus-selbri cannot be made sticky. This is an unfortunate, but unavoidable, restriction.

## 16.8. The problem of “any”
Consider the English sentence 
**Example 16.47. **
Anyone who goes to the store, walks across the field.
  

Using the facilities already discussed, a plausible translation might be
**Example 16.48. **
ro | da | poi | klama | le | zarci | cu | cadzu | le | foldi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | X | such-that-it | goes-to | the | store |  | walks-on | the | field.  
Everyone who goes to the store walks across the field.  
---  
  

But there is a subtle difference between Example 16.47 and Example 16.48. Example 16.48 tells us that, in fact, there are people who go to the store, and that they walk across the field. A sumti of the type _ro da poi klama_ requires that there are things which __klama__ : Lojban universal claims always imply the corresponding existential claims as well. Example 16.47, on the other hand, does not require that there are any people who go to the store: it simply states, conditionally, that if there is anyone who goes to the store, he or she walks across the field as well. This conditional form mirrors the true Lojban translation of Example 16.47:
**Example 16.49. **
ro | da | zo'u | da | go | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X | : | X | if-and-only-if | it-is-a-goer-to | the | store  
gi | cadzu | le | foldi  
---|---|---|---  
| is-a-walker-on | the | field.  
  

Although Example 16.49 is a universal claim as well, its universality only implies that there are objects of some sort or another in the universe of discourse. Because the claim is conditional, nothing is implied about the existence of goers-to-the-store or of walkers-on-the-field, merely that any entity which is one is also the other.
There is another use of “any” in English that is not universal but existential. Consider
**Example 16.50. **
I need any box that is bigger than this one.
  

Example 16.50 does not at all mean that I need every box bigger than this one, for indeed I do not; I require only one box. But the naive translation
**Example 16.51. **
mi | nitcu | da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | some-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-one  
  

does not work either, because it asserts that there really is such a box, as the prenex paraphrase demonstrates:
**Example 16.52. **
da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti | zo'u | mi | nitcu | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this | : | I | need | X.  
  

What to do? Well, the x2 place of __nitcu__ can be filled with an event as well as an object, and in fact Example 16.51 can also be paraphrased as:
**Example 16.53. **
mi | nitcu | lo | nu | mi | ponse | lo | tanxe  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | an | event-of | I | possess | some | box(es)  
poi | bramau | ti  
---|---|---  
which-are | bigger-than | this-one.  
  

Rewritten using variables, Example 16.53 becomes
**Example 16.54. **
mi | nitcu | lo | nu | da | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | an | event-of | there-being-an-X | such-that:  
da | se | ponse | mi  
---|---|---|---  
X |  | is-possessed-by | me  
gi'e | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-thing.  
  

So we see that a prenex can be attached to a bridi that is within a sentence. By default, a variable always behaves as if it is bound in the prenex which (notionally) is attached to the smallest enclosing bridi, and its scope does not extend beyond that bridi. However, the variable may be placed in an outer prenex explicitly:
**Example 16.55. **
da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-one | such-that:  
mi | nitcu | le | nu | mi | ponse | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | the | event-of | my | possessing | X.  
  

But what are the implications of Example 16.53 and Example 16.55? The main difference is that in Example 16.55, the __da__ is said to exist in the real world of the outer bridi; but in Example 16.53, the existence is only within the inner bridi, which is a mere event that need not necessarily come to pass. So Example 16.55 means
**Example 16.56. **
There's a box, bigger than this one, that I need
  

which is what Example 16.52 says, whereas Example 16.53 turns out to be an effective translation of our original Example 16.47. So uses of “any” that aren't universal end up being reflected by variables bound in the prenex of a subordinate bridi.

## 7.6. Anaphoric pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the ri-series and the go'i-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ri |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats last sumti)   
---|---|---|---  
ra |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats previous sumti)  
ru |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats long-ago sumti)  
go'i |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last bridi)  
go'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats previous bridi)  
go'u |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats long-ago bridi)  
go'e |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last-but-one bridi)  
go'o |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats future bridi)  
nei |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats current bridi)  
no'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats outer bridi)  
ra'o |  RAhO |  |  pro-cmavo update  
The term “anaphora” literally means “repetition”, but is used in linguistics to refer to pronouns whose significance is the repetition of earlier words, namely their antecedents. Lojban provides three pro-sumti anaphora, __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ ; and three corresponding pro-bridi anaphora, __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__. These cmavo reveal the same vowel pattern as the ti-series, but the “distances” referred to are not physical distances, but distances from the anaphoric cmavo to its antecedent.
The cmavo __ri__ is the simplest of these; it has the same referent as the last complete sumti appearing before the __ri__ :
**Example 7.30. **
la | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | ri | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | [repeat-last-sumti] | room.  
Alice sleeps in her room.  
---  
  

The __ri__ in Example 7.30 is equivalent to repeating the last sumti, which is _la .alis._ , so Example 7.30 is equivalent to:
**Example 7.31. **
la | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | la | .alis. | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | that-named | Alice | room.  
Alice sleeps in Alice's room.  
---  
  

Note that __ri__ does not repeat _le ri kumfa_ , because that sumti is not yet complete when __ri__ appears. This prevents __ri__ from getting entangled in paradoxes of self-reference. (There are plenty of other ways to do that!) Note also that sumti within other sumti, as in quotations, abstractions, and the like, are counted in the order of their beginnings; thus a lower level sumti like _la alis._ in Example 7.31 is considered to be more recent than a higher level sumti that contains it.
Certain sumti are ignored by __ri__ ; specifically, most of the other cmavo of KOhA, and the almost-grammatically-equivalent lerfu words of selma'o BY. It is simpler just to repeat these directly:
**Example 7.32. **
mi | prami | mi  
---|---|---  
I | love | me.  
I love myself.  
---  
  

However, the cmavo of the ti-series can be picked up by __ri__ , because you might have changed what you are pointing at, so repeating __ti__ may not be effective. Likewise, __ri__ itself (or rather its antecedent) can be repeated by a later __ri__ ; in fact, a string of __ri__ cmavo with no other intervening sumti always all repeat the same sumti:
**Example 7.33. **
la | djan. | viska | le | tricu | .i  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | sees | the | tree. |   
ri | se jadni | le |  | ri | jimca  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[repeat-last] | is-adorned-by | the | of- | [repeat-last] | branch.  
John sees the tree. It is adorned by its branches.  
---  
  

Here the second __ri__ has as antecedent the first __ri__ , which has as antecedent _le tricu_. All three refer to the same thing: a tree.
To refer to the next-to-last sumti, the third-from-last sumti, and so on, __ri__ may be subscripted (subscripts are explained in Section 19.6):
**Example 7.34. **
lo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | rixire  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [repeat-next-to-last].  
.i | la | .alis. | pilno | riximu  
---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | uses | [repeat-fifth-from-last].  
  

Here _rixire_ , or “ri-sub-2”, skips _la rik._ to reach _lo forca_. In the same way, _riximu_ , or “ri-sub-5”, skips _la .alis._ , _rixire_ , _la rik._ , and _lo forca_ to reach _lo smuci_. As can clearly be seen, this procedure is barely practicable in writing, and would break down totally in speech.
Therefore, the vaguer __ra__ and __ru__ are also provided. The cmavo __ra__ repeats a recently used sumti, and __ru__ one that was further back in the speech or text. The use of __ra__ and __ru__ forces the listener to guess at the referent, but makes life easier for the speaker. Can __ra__ refer to the last sumti, like __ri__? The answer is no if __ri__ has also been used. If __ri__ has not been used, then __ra__ might be the last sumti. Likewise, if __ra__ has been used, then any use of __ru__ would repeat a sumti earlier than the one __ra__ is repeating. A more reasonable version of Example 7.34, but one that depends more on context, is:
**Example 7.35. **
lo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | ra  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [some-previous-thing].  
.i | la | .alis. | pilno | ru  
---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | uses | [some-more-remote-thing].  
  

In Example 7.35, the use of __ra__ tells us that something other than _la rik._ is the antecedent; _lo forca_ is the nearest sumti, so it is probably the antecedent. Similarly, the antecedent of __ru__ must be something even further back in the utterance than _lo forca_ , and _lo smuci_ is the obvious candidate.
The meaning of __ri__ must be determined every time it is used. Since __ra__ and __ru__ are more vaguely defined, they may well retain the same meaning for a while, but the listener cannot count on this behavior. To make a permanent reference to something repeated by __ri__ , __ra__ , or __ru__ , use __goi__ and a ko'a-series cmavo:
**Example 7.36. **
la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | goes-to | the | store  
.i | ri | goi | ko'a | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---  
. | It-last-mentioned | also-known-as | it-1 | is-blue.  
  

allows the store to be referred to henceforth as __ko'a__ without ambiguity. Example 7.36 is equivalent to Example 7.21 and eliminates any possibility of __ko'a__ being interpreted by the listener as referring to Alice.
The cmavo __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__ follow exactly the same rules as __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ , except that they are pro-bridi, and therefore repeat bridi, not sumti – specifically, main sentence bridi. Any bridi that are embedded within other bridi, such as relative clauses or abstractions, are not counted. Like the cmavo of the broda-series, the cmavo of the go'i-series copy all sumti with them. This makes __go'i__ by itself convenient for answering a question affirmatively, or for repeating the last bridi, possibly with new sumti:
**Example 7.37. **
xu | zo | .djan. | cmene | do | .i | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True-false?] | The-word |  “John” | is-the-name-of | you? |  | [repeat last bridi].  
Is John your name? Yes.  
---  
  

**Example 7.38. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | .i | do | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store | . | You | [repeat last bridi].  
I go to the store . You, too.  
---  
  

Note that Example 7.38 means the same as Example 7.26, but without the bother of assigning an actual broda-series word to the first bridi. For long-term reference, use _go'i cei broda_ or the like, analogously to _ri goi ko'a_ in Example 7.36.
The remaining four cmavo of the go'i-series are provided for convenience or for achieving special effects. The cmavo __go'e__ means the same as _go'ixire_ : it repeats the last bridi but one. This is useful in conversation:
**Example 7.39. **
A: | mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
A: | I | [future] | go-to | the | store.  
A: I am going to the store.  
---  
B: | mi | nelci | le | si'o | mi | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
B: | I | like | the | concept-of | I | [repeat-last-bridi].  
B: I like the idea of my going.  
---  
A: | do | go'e  
---|---|---  
A: | You | [repeat-last-bridi-but-one].  
A: You'll go, too.  
---  
  

Here B's sentence repeats A's within an abstraction (explained in Chapter 11): _le si'o mi go'i_ means _le si'o mi klama le zarci_. Why must B use the word __mi__ explicitly to replace the x1 of _mi klama le zarci_ , even though it looks like __mi__ is replacing __mi__? Because B's __mi__ refers to B, whereas A's __mi__ refers to A. If B said:
**Example 7.40. **
mi nelci le si'o go'i
  

that would mean:
> I like the idea of your going to the store.
The repetition signalled by __go'i__ is not literally of words, but of concepts. Finally, A repeats her own sentence, but with the x1 changed to __do__ , meaning B. Note that in Example 7.39, the tense __ba__ (future time) is carried along by both __go'i__ and __go'e__.
Descriptions based on go'i-series cmavo can be very useful for repeating specific sumti of previous bridi:
**Example 7.41. **
le | xekri | mlatu | cu | klama | le | zarci | .i | le  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | black | cat |  | goes-to | the | store. |  | That-described-as-the-x1-place-of  
go'i | cu | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
[repeat-last-bridi] |  | walks-on | the | ice.  
The black cat goes to the store. It walks on the ice.  
---  
  

Here the __go'i__ repeats _le xekri mlatu cu klama le zarci_ , and since __le__ makes the x1 place into a description, and the x1 place of this bridi is _le xekri mlatu_ , _le go'i_ means _le xekri mlatu_.
The cmavo __go'o__ , __nei__ , and __no'a__ have been little used so far. They repeat respectively some future bridi, the current bridi, and the bridi that encloses the current bridi (__no'a__ , unlike the other members of the go'i- series, can repeat non-sentence bridi). Here are a few examples:
**Example 7.42. **
mi | nupre | le | nu | mi | go'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | promise | the | event-of | I | [repeat-future-bridi].  
.i | ba | dunda | le | djini |  | le | bersa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [Future] | give | the | money | to | the | son  
.i | ba | dunda | le | zdani |  | le | tixnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [Future] | give | the | house | to | the | daughter  
I promise to do the following: Give the money to my son. Give the house to my daughter.  
---  
  

(Note: The Lojban does not contain an equivalent of the __my__ in the colloquial English; it leaves the fact that it is the speaker's son and daughter that are referred to implicit. To make the fact explicit, use _le bersa_ /_tixnu be mi_.)
For good examples of __nei__ and __no'a__ , we need nested bridi contexts:
**Example 7.43. **
mi | se | pluka | le | nu | do | pensi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | am-pleased-by | the | event-of | (you | think-about | the | (event-of  
nei | kei | pu | le | nu | do | zukte  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[main-bridi] | ) | before | the | (event-of | your | acting).  
I am pleased that you thought about whether I would be pleased (about ...) before you acted.  
---  
  

**Example 7.44. **
mi | ba | klama | ca | le | nu | do | no'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | go | [present] | the | event-of | you | [repeats outer bridi]  
I will go when you do.  
---  
  

Finally, __ra'o__ is a cmavo that can be appended to any go'i-series cmavo, or indeed any cmavo of selma'o GOhA, to signal that pro-sumti or pro-bridi cmavo in the antecedent are to be repeated literally and reinterpreted in their new context. Normally, any pro-sumti used within the antecedent of the pro-bridi keep their meanings intact. In the presence of __ra'o__ , however, their meanings must be reinterpreted with reference to the new environment. If someone says to you:
**Example 7.45. **
mi ba lumci le mi karce  
---  
I will wash my car.  
---  
  

you might reply either:
**Example 7.46. **
mi go'i  
---  
I will wash your car.  
---  
  

or:
**Example 7.47. **
mi go'i ra'o  
---  
I will wash my car.  
---  
  

The __ra'o__ forces the second __mi__ from the original bridi to mean the new speaker rather than the former speaker. This means that _go'e ra'o_ would be an acceptable alternative to _do go'e_ in B's statement in Example 7.39.
The anaphoric pro-sumti of this section can be used in quotations, but never refer to any of the supporting text outside the quotation, since speakers presumably do not know that they may be quoted by someone else.
However, a _ri-_ series or _go'a-_ series reference within a quotation can refer to something mentioned in an earlier quotation if the two quotations are closely related in time and context. This allows a quotation to be broken up by narrative material without interfering with the pro-sumti within it. Here's an example:
**Example 7.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | lu | mi | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | says | [quote] | I | go-to | the | store | [unquote].  
.i | la | .alis. | cusku | lu | mi | go'i | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | says | [quote] | I | [repeat] | [unquote].  
John says, “I am going to the store.” Alice says, “Me too.”  
---  
  

Of course, there is no problem with narrative material referring to something within a quotation: people who quote, unlike people who are quoted, are aware of what they are doing.
