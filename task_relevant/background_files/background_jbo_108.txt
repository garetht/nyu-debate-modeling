## 13.16. Tentative conclusion
The exact ramifications of the indicator system in actual usage are unknown. There has never been anything like it in natural language before. The system provides great potential for emotional expression and transcription, from which significant Sapir-Whorf effects can be anticipated. When communicating across cultural boundaries, where different indicators are often used for the same emotion, accidental offense can be avoided. If we ever ran into an alien race, a culturally neutral language of emotion could be vital. (A classic example, taken from the science fiction of Larry Niven, is to imagine speaking Lojban to the carnivorous warriors called Kzinti, noting that a human smile bares the teeth, and could be seen as an intent to attack.) And for communicating emotions to computers, when we cannot identify all of the signals involved in subliminal human communication (things like body language are also cultural), a system like this is needed.
We have tried to err on the side of overkill. There are distinctions possible in this system that no one may care to make in any culture. But it was deemed more neutral to overspecify and let usage decide, than to choose a limited set and constrain emotional expression. For circumstances in which even the current indicator set is not enough, it is possible using the cmavo __sei__ , explained in Section 19.12, to create metalinguistic comments that act like indicators.
We envision an evolutionary development. At this point, the system is little more than a mental toy. Many of you who read this will try playing around with various combinations of indicators, trying to figure out what emotions they express and when the expressions might be useful. You may even find an expression for which there currently is no good English word and start using it. Why not, if it helps you express your feelings?
There will be a couple dozen of these used pretty much universally – mostly just simple attitudinals with, at most, intensity markers. These are the ones that will quickly be expressed at the subconscious level. But every Lojbanist who plays with the list will bring in a couple of new words. Poets will paint emotional pictures, and people who identify with those pictures will use the words so created for their own experiences.
Just as a library of tanru is built up, so will a library of attitudes be built. Unlike the tanru, though, the emotional expressions are built on some fairly nebulous root emotions – words that cannot be defined with the precision of the gismu. The emotion words of Lojban will very quickly take on a life of their own, and the outline given here will evolve into a true system of emotions.
There are several theories as to the nature of emotion, and they change from year to year as we learn more about ourselves. Whether or not Lojban's additive/scalar emotional model is an accurate model for human emotions, it does support the linguistic needs for expressing those emotions. Researchers may learn more about the nature of human emotions by exploring the use of the system by Lojban speakers. They also may be able to use the Lojban system as a means for more clearly recording emotions.
The full list of scales and attitudes will probably not be used until someone speaks the language from birth. Until then, people will use the attitudes that are important to them. In this way, we counter cultural bias – if a culture is prone to recognizing and/or expressing certain emotions more than others, its members will use only those out of the enormous set available. If a culture hides certain emotions, its members simply won't express them.
Perhaps native Lojban speakers will be more expressively clear about their emotions than others. Perhaps they will feel some emotions more strongly than others in ways that can be correlated with the word choices; any difference from the norms of other cultures could be significant. Psychologists have devised elaborate tests for measuring attitudes and personality; this may be the easiest area in which to detect any systematic cultural effect of the type sought to confirm Sapir-Whorf, simply because we already have tools in existence to test it. Because Lojban is unique among languages in having such extensive and expressive indicators, it is likely that a Sapir-Whorf effect will occur and will be recognized.
It is unlikely that we will know the true potential of a system like this one until and unless we have children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking environment. We learn too many cultural habits in the realm of emotional communication “at our mother's knee”. Such children will have a Lojban system that has stronger reinforcement than any typical culture system. The second generation of such children, then, could be said to be the start of a true Lojbanic culture.
We shouldn't need to wait that long to detect significant effects. Emotion is so basic to our lives that even a small change or improvement in emotional communication would have immediately noticeable effects. Perhaps it will be the case that the most important contribution of our “logical language” will be in the non-logical realm of emotion!

## 7.15. lujvo based on pro-sumti
There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See Section 7.16 for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.
Thus __donta'a__ , meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted as _tavla be do_ , and would have the place structure
**Example 7.76. **
> t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
  

since `t2` (the addressee) is already known to be __do__.
On the other hand, the lujvo __donma'o__ , literally “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal pronoun”, would be interpreted as _cmavo be zo do_ , and have the place structure:
**Example 7.77. **
> c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
  

since both the `c2` place (the grammatical class) and the `c3` place (the meaning) are obvious from the context __do__.
An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the __fo'a__ series is to express lujvo which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An example would be:
**Example 7.78. **
fo'a | goi | le | kulnrsu,omi | .i | lo | fo'arselsanga  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x6 | stands-for | the | Finnish-culture | . | An | x6-song.  
  

Finally, lujvo involving __zi'o__ are also possible, and are fully discussed in Chapter 12. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for __zi'o__ as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a _se pinxe be zi'o_ , the lujvo corresponding to this is _zilrelselpinxe_ (deleting the second place of _se pinxe_). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that _zilpavypinxe_ has the same place structure as _zilrelselpinxe_ , and _lo zilpavypinxe_ , like _lo zilrelselpinxe_ , refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ , __du__ , and __bu'a__ also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for _du-_ based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.

## 14.7. More than two propositions
So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.
Of the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,
**Example 14.31. **
mi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,
**Example 14.32. **
mi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that one or more of the component sentences is true.
O, however, is different. Working out the truth table for
**Example 14.33. **
mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  
  

shows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:
> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.
Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.
In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.
There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: 
**Example 14.34. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  
.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

Does this mean:
**Example 14.35. **
I like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.
  

Or is the correct translation:
**Example 14.36. **
Either I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.
  

Example 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:
**Example 14.37. **
ga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | I | like | that-named | Martha)  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas
**Example 14.38. **
ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary).  
  

is not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.

## 14.8. Grouping of afterthought connectives
There are several ways in Lojban to render Example 14.35 using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo __bo__ (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with __bo__ are interpreted before connections not so marked. Example 14.39 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.38:
**Example 14.39. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John, | and | I | like | that-named | Martha  
.ijabo | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by __.i__ __ja__ first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by __.i__ __je__.
Eks can have __bo__ attached in exactly the same way, so that Example 14.40 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39:
**Example 14.40. **
mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with __bo__ , for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.
What happens if __bo__ is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in Example 14.41?
**Example 14.41. **
mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Does this wind up meaning the same as Example 14.34 and Example 14.36? Not at all. A second rule relating to __bo__ is that where several __bo__ -marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, Example 14.41 in fact means the same as Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with __bo__ should be avoided.
The use of __bo__ , therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of Example 14.37 and Example 14.38, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ are used with ijeks, and __ke__ and __ke'e__ with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (__ke__ and __ke'e__ are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.42. **
I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
  

where the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express Example 14.42 in afterthought, we can say:
**Example 14.43. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije[bo] | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me,  
.ijanai | mi | prami | do | .ijebo | do | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | I | love | you | and | you | love | me.  
  

marking two of the ijeks with __bo__ for high precedence. (The first __bo__ is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)
But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:
**Example 14.44. **
tu'e | mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me | )  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

where the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ pairs set off the structure. The cmavo __tu'u__ is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in Example 14.44 is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.
In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to __bo__ grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.
Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:
**Example 14.45. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider
**Example 14.46. **
I walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.
  

Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to Example 14.44, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with __ke__ , so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing Example 14.47, which is instead parallel to Example 14.45:
**Example 14.47. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | the | house  
.a | ke | le | ckule | .e | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | the | school | and | the | office | ).  
  

If sumti were allowed to begin with __ke__ , unavoidable ambiguities would result, so __ke__ grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to __tu'e__ grouping of bridi, as Example 14.44 shows.
Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of Example 14.33: “I am German, rich, and a man – or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:
**Example 14.48. **
[tu'e] | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-rich | )  
.ije | tu'e | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | nanmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | ( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-a-man | ).  
  

The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.

## 11.4. Property abstractions
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ka |  NU |  property abstractor  
---|---|---  
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
The things described by _le nu_ descriptions (or, to put it another way, the things of which __nu__ selbri may correctly be predicated) are only moderately “abstract”. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is “the property of being blue”, or “the property of being a go-er”? They are what logicians call “intensions”. If John has a heart, then “the property of having a heart” is an abstract object which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,
**Example 11.21. **
la | djan. | cu | se risna | zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-as-heart | something-unspecified.  
John has a heart.  
---  
  

has the same truth conditions as
**Example 11.22. **
la | djan. | cu | ckaji  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-the-property  
le | ka | se risna | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | having-as-heart | something.  
John has the property of having a heart.  
---  
  

(The English word “have” frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban properties: things are said to “have” properties, but this is not the same sense of “have” as in “I have money”, which is possession.)
Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:
**Example 11.23. **
do | cnino | mi | le | ka | xunre | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-new | to-me | in-the-quality-of-the | property-of | being-red.  
You are new to me in redness.  
---  
  

(The English suffix “-ness” often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix “-ity”.)
We can also move the property description to the x1 place of Example 11.23, producing:
**Example 11.24. **
le | ka | do | xunre | [kei] | cu | cnino | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | property-of | your | being-red |  |  | is-new | to me.  
Your redness is new to me.  
---  
  

It would be suitable to use Example 11.23 and Example 11.24 to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.
There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:
**Example 11.25. **
ka | mi | prami | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | me | loving | something-unspecified  
  

is quite different from
**Example 11.26. **
ka | [zo'e] | prami | mi | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | something-unspecified | loving | me  
  

In particular, sentences like Example 11.27 and Example 11.28 are quite different in meaning:
**Example 11.27. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami  
---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X)  
I love John more than I love George.  
---  
  

**Example 11.28. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka |  | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property of | (X | loves | me).  
John loves me more than George loves me.  
---  
  

The “X” used in the glosses of Example 11.27 through Example 11.28 as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in Section 11.2. Instead, the cmavo __ce'u__ of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)
Therefore, an explicit equivalent of Example 11.27, with no ellipsis, is:
**Example 11.29. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami | ce'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X).  
  

and of Example 11.28 is:
**Example 11.30. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | ce'u | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (X | loves | me).  
  

This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:
**Example 11.31. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of |  | giving | the | horse  
  

into
**Example 11.32. **
le | ka | ce'u | dunda | le | xirma |  | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | someone-unspecified | )  
the property of being a giver of the horse  
---  
  

which is the most natural interpretation of Example 11.31, versus
**Example 11.33. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma |  | ce'u | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (someone-unspecified | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | X | )  
the property of being one to whom the horse is given  
---  
  

which is also a possible interpretation.
It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction. Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri __bridi__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _bridi_ _ x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction) among arguments (sequence/set) x3
The place structure of __ka__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> _ _ka_ _ x1 is a property of (the bridi)

## 7.11. Abstraction focus pro-sumti: _ce'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __ce'u__ is used within abstraction bridi, particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo __ka__. Abstractions, including the uses of __ce'u__ , are discussed in full in Chapter 11.
In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using __ce'u__. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly between:
**Example 7.71. **
le | ka | ce'u | gleki  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | being-happy)  
the property of being happy  
---  
happiness  
  

and
**Example 7.72. **
le | ka | gleki | ce'u  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (being-happy-about | X)  
the property of being that which someone is happy about

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).  
---

## 9.4. Conversion: SE
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
se |  SE |  2nd place conversion  
---|---|---  
te |  SE |  3rd place conversion  
ve |  SE |  4th place conversion  
xe |  SE |  5th place conversion  
So far we have seen ways to move sumti around within a bridi, but the actual place structure of the selbri has always remained untouched. The conversion cmavo of selma'o SE are incorporated within the selbri itself, and produce a new selbri (called a converted selbri) with a different place structure. In particular, after the application of any SE cmavo, the number and purposes of the places remain the same, but two of them have been exchanged, the x1 place and another. Which place has been exchanged with x1 depends on the cmavo chosen. Thus, for example, when __se__ is used, the x1 place is swapped with the x2 place.
Note that the cmavo of SE begin with consecutive consonants in alphabetical order. There is no “1st place conversion” cmavo, because exchanging the x1 place with itself is a pointless maneuver.
Here are the place structures of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the destination of x2's going from x3 via x4 using x5
and _te klama_ :
> x1 is the origin and x2 the destination of x3 going via x4 using x5
and _ve klama_ :
> x1 is the route to x2 from x3 used by x4 going via x5
and _xe klama_ :
> x1 is the means in going to x2 from x3 via x4 employed by x5
Note that the place structure numbers in each case continue to be listed in the usual order, x1 to x5.
Consider the following pair of examples:
**Example 9.18. **
la | bastn. | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Boston |  | is-the-destination | of-me.  
Boston is my destination.  
---  
Boston is gone to by me.  
  

**Example 9.19. **
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I.  
To Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.18 and Example 9.19 mean the same thing, in the sense that there is a relationship of going with the speaker as the agent and Boston as the destination (and with unspecified origin, route, and means). Structurally, however, they are quite different. Example 9.18 has _la bastn._ in the x1 place and __mi__ in the x2 place of the selbri _se klama_ , and uses standard bridi order; Example 9.19 has __mi__ in the x1 place and _la bastn._ in the x2 place of the selbri __klama__ , and uses a non-standard order.
The most important use of conversion is in the construction of descriptions. A description is a sumti which begins with a cmavo of selma'o LA or LE, called the descriptor, and contains (in the simplest case) a selbri. We have already seen the descriptions _le dargu_ and _le karce_. To this we could add:
**Example 9.20. **
le | klama  
---|---  
the go-er, the one who goes  
---  
  

In every case, the description is about something which fits into the x1 place of the selbri. In order to get a description of a destination (that is, something fitting the x2 place of __klama__), we must convert the selbri to _se klama_ , whose x1 place is a destination. The result is
**Example 9.21. **
le | se | klama  
---|---|---  
the destination gone to by someone  
---  
  

Likewise, we can create three more converted descriptions:
**Example 9.22. **
le | te | klama  
---|---|---  
the origin of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.23. **
le | ve | klama  
---|---|---  
the route of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.24. **
le | xe | klama  
---|---|---  
the means by which someone goes  
---  
  

Example 9.23 does not mean “the route” plain and simple: that is _le pluta_ , using a different selbri. It means a route that is used by someone for an act of __klama__ ; that is, a journey with origin and destination. A “road” on Mars, on which no one has traveled or is ever likely to, may be called _le pluta_ , but it cannot be _le ve klama_ , since there exists no one for whom it is _le ve klama be fo da_ (the route taken in an actual journey by someone [da]).
When converting selbri that are more complex than a single brivla, it is important to realize that the scope of a SE cmavo is only the following brivla (or equivalent unit). In order to convert an entire tanru, it is necessary to enclose the tanru in __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets:
**Example 9.25. **
mi | se | ke | blanu | zdani | [ke'e] | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [2nd-conversion] | ( | blue | house | ) | this-thing  
  

The place structure of _blanu zdani_ (blue house) is the same as that of __zdani__ , by the rule given in Section 9.1. The place structure of __zdani__ is:
> _ _zdani_ _ x1 is a house/nest/lair/den for inhabitant x2
The place structure of _se ke blanu zdani [ke'e]_ is therefore:
> x1 is the inhabitant of the blue house (etc.) x2
Consequently, Example 9.25 means:
> I am the inhabitant of the blue house which is this thing.
Conversion applied to only part of a tanru has subtler effects which are explained in Section 5.11.
It is grammatical to convert a selbri more than once with SE; later (inner) conversions are applied before earlier (outer) ones. For example, the place structure of _se te klama_ is achieved by exchanging the x1 and x2 place of _te klama_ , producing:
> x1 is the destination and x2 is the origin of x3 going via x4 using x5
On the other hand, _te se klama_ has a place structure derived from swapping the x1 and x3 places of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the origin of x2's going to x3 via x4 using x5
which is quite different. However, multiple conversions like this are never necessary. Arbitrary scrambling of places can be achieved more easily and far more intelligibly with FA tags, and only a single conversion is ever needed in a description.
(Although no one has made any real use of it, it is perhaps worth noting that compound conversions of the form _setese_ , where the first and third cmavo are the same, effectively swap the two given places while leaving the others, including x1, alone: _setese_ (or equivalently _tesete_) swap the x2 and x3 places, whereas _texete_ (or _xetexe_) swap the x3 and x5 places.)

## 5.11. Conversion of simple selbri
Conversion is the process of changing a selbri so that its places appear in a different order. This is not the same as labeling the sumti with the cmavo of FA, as mentioned in Section 5.7, and then rearranging the order in which the sumti are spoken or written. Conversion transforms the selbri into a distinct, though closely related, selbri with renumbered places.
In Lojban, conversion is accomplished by placing a cmavo of selma'o SE before the selbri:
**Example 5.109. **
mi | prami | do  
---|---|---  
I love you.  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 5.110. **
do | se | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---  
You | [swap x1 and x2] | love | me.  
You are loved by me.  
---  
  

Conversion is fully explained in Section 9.4. For the purposes of this chapter, the important point about conversion is that it applies only to the following simple selbri. When trying to convert a tanru, therefore, it is necessary to be careful! Consider Example 5.111:
**Example 5.111. **
la | .alis. | cu | cadzu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | is-a-walker | type-of-goer-to | the | market.  
That-named | Alice |  | walkingly | goes-to | the | market.  
Alice walks to the market.  
---  
  

To convert this sentence so that _le zarci_ is in the x1 place, one correct way is:
**Example 5.112. **
le | zarci | cu | se  
---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-a-[swap x1/x2]  
The | market |  |   
ke | cadzu | klama | [ke'e] | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | walker | type-of-goer-to | ) | that-named | Alice.  
| is-walkingly | gone-to-by |  | that-named | Alice.  
  

The __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets cause the entire tanru to be converted by the __se__ , which would otherwise convert only __cadzu__ , leading to:
**Example 5.113. **
le | zarci | cu | se | cadzu  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | (is-a-[swap x1/x2] | walker)  
The | market |  |  | is-a-walking-surface  
klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
  

whatever that might mean. An alternative approach, since the place structure of _cadzu klama_ is that of __klama__ alone, is to convert only the latter:
**Example 5.114. **
le | zarci | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice.  
  

But the tanru in Example 5.114 may or may not have the same meaning as that in Example 5.111; in particular, because __cadzu__ is not converted, there is a suggestion that although Alice is the goer, the market is the walker. With a different sumti as x1, this seemingly odd interpretation might make considerable sense:
**Example 5.115. **
la | djan. | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice  
  

suggests that Alice is going to John, who is a moving target.
There is an alternative type of conversion, using the cmavo __jai__ of selma'o JAI optionally followed by a modal or tense construction. Grammatically, such a combination behaves exactly like conversion using SE. More details can be found in Section 9.12.

## 9.17. Complete table of BAI cmavo with rough English equivalents
The following table shows all the cmavo belonging to selma'o BAI, and has five columns. The first column is the cmavo itself; the second column is the gismu linked to it. The third column gives an English phrase which indicates the meaning of the cmavo; and the fourth column indicates its meaning when preceded by __se__.
For those cmavo with meaningful __te__ , __ve__ , and even __xe__ conversions (depending on the number of places of the underlying gismu), the meanings of these are shown on one or two extra rows following the primary row for that cmavo.
It should be emphasized that the place structures of the gismu control the meanings of the BAI cmavo. The English phrases shown here are only suggestive, and are often too broad or too narrow to correctly specify what the acceptable range of uses for the modal tag are.

The lujvo __tamsmi__ on which __tai__ is based is derived from the tanru _tarmi simsa_ and has the place structure:

This lujvo is employed because __tarmi__ does not have a place structure useful for the modal's purpose.

## 5.12. Scalar negation of selbri
Negation is too large and complex a topic to explain fully in this chapter; see Chapter 15. In brief, there are two main types of negation in Lojban. This section is concerned with so-called “scalar negation”, which is used to state that a true relation between the sumti is something other than what the selbri specifies. Scalar negation is expressed by cmavo of selma'o NAhE:
**Example 5.116. **
la | .alis. | cu | na'e | ke | cadzu | klama | [ke'e] | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | non- | ( | walkingly | goes-to | ) | the | market.  
Alice doesn't walk to the market.  
---  
  

meaning that Alice's relationship to the market is something other than that of walking there. But if the __ke__ were omitted, the result would be:
**Example 5.117. **
la | .alis. | cu | na'e | cadzu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | non- | walkingly | goes-to | the | market.  
Alice doesn't walk to the market.  
---  
  

meaning that Alice does go there in some way (__klama__ is not negated), but by a means other than that of walking. Example 5.116 negates both __cadzu__ and __klama__ , suggesting that Alice's relation to the market is something different from walkingly-going; it might be walking without going, or going without walking, or neither.
Of course, any of the simple selbri types explained in Section 5.9 may be used in place of brivla in any of these examples:
**Example 5.118. **
la | djonz. | cu | na'e | pamoi | cusku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Jones |  | is-non- | 1st | speaker  
Jones is not the first speaker.  
---  
  

Since only __pamoi__ is negated, an appropriate inference is that he is some other kind of speaker.
Here is an assortment of more complex examples showing the interaction of scalar negation with __bo__ grouping, __ke__ and __ke'e__ grouping, logical connection, and sumti linked with __be__ and __bei__ :
**Example 5.119. **
mi | na'e | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | be'o | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | ((non- | quickly) | (walking |  | using | the | arms | )) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, walking using my arms other than quickly.  
---  
  

In Example 5.119, __na'e__ negates only __sutra__. Contrast Example 5.120:
**Example 5.120. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | [be'o]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | non- | ( | quickly | (walking |  | using | the | arms | )  
ke'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, other than by walking quickly on my arms.  
---  
  

Now consider Example 5.121 and Example 5.122, which are equivalent in meaning, but use __ke__ grouping and __bo__ grouping respectively:
**Example 5.121. **
mi | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | be'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | (quickly | (walking |  | using | the | arms | )  
je | masno | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, both quickly walking using my arms and slowly.  
---  
  

**Example 5.122. **
mi | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | [be'o] | ke'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | ( | (quickly | (walking |  | using | the | arms | ) | )  
je | masno | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, both quickly walking using my arms and slowly.  
---  
  

However, if we place a __na'e__ at the beginning of the selbri in both Example 5.121 and Example 5.122, we get different results:
**Example 5.123. **
mi | na'e | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | be'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | ((non- | quickly) | (walking |  | using | the | arms | )  
je | masno | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, both walking using my arms other than quickly, and also slowly.  
---  
  

**Example 5.124. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | [be'o] | ke'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | (non | ( | quickly | (walking |  | using | the | arms) |  | )  
je | masno | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, both other than quickly walking using my arms, and also slowly.  
---  
  

The difference arises because the __na'e__ in Example 5.124 negates the whole construction from __ke__ to __ke'e__ , whereas in Example 5.123 it negates __sutra__ alone.
Beware of omitting terminators in these complex examples! If the explicit __ke'e__ is left out in Example 5.124, it is transformed into:
**Example 5.125. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | be'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | non- | ( | quickly | ((walking |  | using | the | arms) | )  
je | masno | klama | [ke'e] | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | ) | the | market.  
I do something other than quickly both going to the market walking using my arms and slowly going to the market.  
---  
  

And if both __ke'e__ and __be'o__ are omitted, the results are even sillier:
**Example 5.126. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | je | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | non | ( | quickly | walk |  | on-my | (the | arm-type | and | slow)  
klama | [be'o] | [ke'e] | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
goers |  | ) | on-the | market.  
I do something other than quickly walking using the goers, both arm-type and slow, relative-to the market.  
---  
  

In Example 5.126, everything after __be__ is a linked sumti, so the place structure is that of __cadzu__ , whose x2 place is the surface walked upon. It is less than clear what an “arm-type goer” might be. Furthermore, since the x3 place has been occupied by the linked sumti, the _le zarci_ following the selbri falls into the nonexistent x4 place of __cadzu__. As a result, the whole example, though grammatical, is complete nonsense. (The bracketed Lojban words appear where a fluent Lojbanist would understand them to be implied.)
Finally, it is also possible to place __na'e__ before a __gu'e__ … __gi__ logically connected tanru construction. The meaning of this usage has not yet been firmly established.
