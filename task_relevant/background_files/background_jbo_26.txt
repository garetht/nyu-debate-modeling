## 12.15. Comparatives and superlatives
English has the concepts of “comparative adjectives” and “superlative adjectives” which can be formed from other adjectives, either by adding the suffixes “-er” and “-est” or by using the words “more” and “most”, respectively. The Lojbanic equivalents, which can be made from any brivla, are lujvo with the tertau __zmadu__ , __mleca__ , __zenba__ , __jdika__ , and __traji__. In order to make these lujvo regular and easy to make, certain special guidelines are imposed.
We will begin with lujvo based on __zmadu__ and __mleca__ , whose place structures are:
**Example 12.86. **
__zmadu__ : z1 is more than z2 in property z3 in quantity z4
__mleca__ : m1 is less than m2 in property m3 in quantity m4
  

For example, the concept “young” is expressed by the gismu __citno__ , with place structure
**Example 12.87. **
__citno__ : c1 is young
  

The comparative concept “younger” can be expressed by the lujvo __citmau__ (based on the veljvo _citno zmadu_ , meaning “young more-than”).
**Example 12.88. **
mi | citmau | do | lo | nanca | be | li | xa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-younger-than | you | by | one-year | multiplied-by | the-number | six.  
I am six years younger than you.  
---  
  

The place structure for __citmau__ is
**Example 12.89. **
> z1=c1 is younger than z2=c1 by amount z4
  

Similarly, in Lojban you can say:
**Example 12.90. **
do | citme'a | mi | lo | nanca | be | li | xa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-less-young-than | me | by | one-year | multiplied-by | the-number | six.  
You are six years less young than me.  
---  
  

In English, “more” comparatives are easier to make and use than “less” comparatives, but in Lojban the two forms are equally easy.
Because of their much simpler place structure, lujvo ending in _-mau_ and _-me'a_ are in fact used much more frequently than __zmadu__ and __mleca__ themselves as selbri. It is highly unlikely for such lujvo to be construed as anything other than implicit-abstraction lujvo. But there is another type of ambiguity relevant to these lujvo, and which has to do with what is being compared.
For example, does _nelcymau_ mean “X likes Y more than X likes Z”, or “X likes Y more than Z likes Y”? Does _klamau_ mean: “X goes to Y more than to Z”, “X goes to Y more than Z does”, “X goes to Y from Z more than from W”, or what?
We answer this concern by putting regularity above any considerations of concept usefulness: by convention, the two things being compared always fit into the first place of the seltau. In that way, each of the different possible interpretations can be expressed by SE-converting the seltau, and making the required place the new first place. As a result, we get the following comparative lujvo place structures:
**Example 12.91. **
_nelcymau_ : z1, more than z2, likes n2 by amount z4
_selnelcymau_ : z1, more than z2, is liked by n1 in amount z4
_klamau_ : z1, more than z2, goes to k2 from k3 via k4 by means of k5
_selklamau_ : z1, more than z2, is gone to by k1 from k3 via k4 by means of k5
_terklamau_ : z1, more than z2, is an origin point from destination k2 for k1's going via k4 by means of k5
  

(See Chapter 11 for the way in which this problem is resolved when lujvo aren't used.)
The ordering rule places the things being compared first, and the other seltau places following. Unfortunately the z4 place, which expresses by how much one entity exceeds the other, is displaced into a lujvo place whose number is different for each lujvo. For example, while _nelcymau_ has z4 as its fourth place, _klamau_ has it as its sixth place. In any sentence where a difficulty arises, this amount-place can be redundantly tagged with __vemau__ (for __zmadu__) or __veme'a__ (for __mleca__) to help make the speaker's intention clear.
It is important to realize that such comparative lujvo do not presuppose their seltau. Just as in English, saying someone is younger than someone else doesn't imply that they're young in the first place: an octogenarian, after all, is still younger than a nonagenarian. Rather, the 80-year-old has a greater _ni citno_ than the 90-year-old. Similarly, a 5-year-old is older than a 1-year-old, but is not considered “old” by most standards.
There are some comparative concepts which are in which the _se zmadu_ is difficult to specify. Typically, these involve comparisons implicitly made with a former state of affairs, where stating a z2 place explicitly would be problematic.
In such cases, it is best not to use __zmadu__ and leave the comparison hanging, but to use instead the gismu __zenba__ , meaning “increase” (and __jdika__ , meaning “decrease”, in place of __mleca__). The gismu __zenba__ was included in the language precisely in order to capture those notions of increase which __zmadu__ can't quite cope with; in addition, we don't have to waste a place in lujvo or tanru on something that we'd never fill in with a value anyway. So we can translate “I'm stronger now” not as
**Example 12.92. **
mi | ca | tsamau  
---|---|---  
I | now | am-stronger.  
  

which implies that I'm currently stronger than somebody else (the elided occupant of the second or z2 place), but as
**Example 12.93. **
mi | ca | tsaze'a  
---|---|---  
I increase in strength.  
---  
  

Finally, lujvo with a tertau of __traji__ are used to build superlatives. The place structure of __traji__ is
**Example 12.94. **
> t1 is superlative in property t2, being the t3 extremum (largest by default) of set t4
  

Consider the gismu __xamgu__ , whose place structure is:
**Example 12.95. **
> xa1 is good for xa2 by standard xa3
  

The comparative form is __xagmau__ , corresponding to English “better”, with a place structure (by the rules given above) of
**Example 12.96. **
> z1 is better than z2 for xa2 by standard xa3 in amount z4
  

We would expect the place structure of __xagrai__ , the superlative form, to somehow mirror that, given that comparatives and superlatives are comparable concepts, resulting in:
**Example 12.97. **
> xa1=t1 is the best of the set t4 for xa2 by standard xa3.
  

The t2 place in __traji__ , normally filled by a property abstraction, is replaced by the seltau places, and the t3 place specifying the extremum of __traji__ (whether the most or the least, that is) is presumed by default to be “the most”.
But the set against which the t1 place of __traji__ is compared is not the t2 place (which would make the place structure of __traji__ fully parallel to that of __zmadu__), but rather the t4 place. Nevertheless, by a special exception to the rules of place ordering, the t4 place of __traji__ -based lujvo becomes the second place of the lujvo. Some examples:
**Example 12.98. **
la | djudis. | cu | citrai | lo'i | lobypli  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Judy is the youngest of all Lojbanists.  
---  
  

**Example 12.99. **
la | .ainctain. | cu | balrai | lo'i | skegunka  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Einstein was the greatest of all scientists.  
---

## 2.16. Indicators
Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. “Aha!”, “Oh no!”, “Ouch!”, “Aahh!”, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.
Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left. For example:
**Example 2.79. **
.ie |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Agreement! |  I |  - |  go.  
Yep! I'll go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.80. **
.ei |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Obligation! |  I |  - |  go.  
I should go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.81. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  le melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go |  to-the beautiful-thing  
.ui |  [ku]  
---|---  
and I am happy because it is the beautiful thing I'm going to |  -  
  

Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison, the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means “and”.
**Example 2.82. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  You |  - |  stay.  
  

**Example 2.83. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ji'a |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  In addition, |  you |  - |  stay. |  added weight  
  

**Example 2.84. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ku'i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  However, |  you |  - |  stay. |  contrast  
  

Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”. Evidentials show the speaker's relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include __za'a__ (I directly observe the relationship), __pe'i__ (I believe that the relationship holds), __ru'a__ (I postulate the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.
**Example 2.85. **
pe'i |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I opine! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.  
  

**Example 2.86. **
za'a |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I directly observe! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.

## 2.11. Examples of brivla
The simplest form of selbri is an individual word. A word which may by itself express a selbri relation is called a __brivla__. The three types of brivla are gismu (root words), lujvo (compounds), and fu'ivla (borrowings from other languages). All have identical grammatical uses. So far, most of our selbri have been gismu or tanru built from gismu.
gismu:
**Example 2.46. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  ti |  zo'e |  zo'e |  ta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go-er |  - |  goes |  destination |  origin |  route |  means.  
I go here (to this) using that means (from somewhere via some route).  
---  
  

lujvo:
**Example 2.47. **
ta |  [cu] |  blari'o  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  is-blue-green.  
  

fu'ivla:
**Example 2.48. **
ti |  [cu] |  djarspageti  
---|---|---  
This |  - |  is-spaghetti.  
  

Some cmavo may also serve as selbri, acting as variables that stand for another selbri. The most commonly used of these is __go'i__ , which represents the main bridi of the previous Lojban sentence, with any new sumti or other sentence features being expressed replacing the previously expressed ones. Thus, in this context:
**Example 2.49. **
ta |  [cu] |  go'i  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  too/same-as-last selbri.  
That (is spaghetti), too.  
---

## 17.12. Acronyms
An acronym is a name constructed of lerfu. English examples are “DNA”, “NATO”, “CIA”. In English, some of these are spelled out (like “DNA” and “CIA”) and others are pronounced more or less as if they were ordinary English words (like “NATO”). Some acronyms fluctuate between the two pronunciations: “SQL” may be “ess cue ell” or “sequel”.
In Lojban, a name can be almost any sequence of sounds that ends in a consonant and is followed by a pause. The easiest way to Lojbanize acronym names is to glue the lerfu words together, using _'_ wherever two vowels would come together (pauses are illegal in names) and adding a final consonant:
**Example 17.40. **
la dyny'abub. .i la ny'abuty'obub. .i la cy'ibu'abub.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulyl. .i la .ibubymym. .i la ny'ybucyc.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

There is no fixed convention for assigning the final consonant. In Example 17.40, the last consonant of the lerfu string has been replicated into final position.
Some compression can be done by leaving out __bu__ after vowel lerfu words (except for __.y.bu__ , wherein the __bu__ cannot be omitted without ambiguity). Compression is moderately important because it's hard to say long names without introducing an involuntary (and illegal) pause:
**Example 17.41. **
la dyny'am. .i la ny'aty'om. .i la cy'i'am.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulym. .i la .ibymym. .i la ny'ybucym.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

In Example 17.41, the final consonant _m_ stands for __merko__ , indicating the source culture of these acronyms.
Another approach, which some may find easier to say and which is compatible with older versions of the language that did not have a _'_ character, is to use the consonant _z_ instead of _'_ :
**Example 17.42. **
la dynyzaz. .i la nyzatyzoz. .i la cyzizaz.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulyz. .i la .ibymyz. .i la nyzybucyz.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

One more alternative to these lengthy names is to use the lerfu string itself prefixed with __me__ , the cmavo that makes sumti into selbri:
**Example 17.43. **
la | me | dy | ny. | .abu  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | what-pertains-to |  “d” |  “n” |  “a”  
  

This works because __la__ , the cmavo that normally introduces names used as sumti, may also be used before a predicate to indicate that the predicate is a (meaningful) name:
**Example 17.44. **
la | cribe | cu | ciska  
---|---|---|---  
That-named |  “Bear” |  | writes.  
Bear is a writer.  
---  
  

Example 17.44 does not of course refer to a bear (_le cribe_ or _lo cribe_) but to something else, probably a person, named “Bear”. Similarly, _me dy ny. .abu_ is a predicate which can be used as a name, producing a kind of acronym which can have pauses between the individual lerfu words.

## 14.14. Non-logical connectives
Way back in Section 14.1, the point was made that not every use of English “and”, “if ... then”, and so on represents a Lojban logical connective. In particular, consider the “and” of:
**Example 14.109. **
John and Alice carried the piano.
  

Given the nature of pianos, this probably means that John carried one end and Alice the other. So it is not true that:
**Example 14.110. **
John carried the piano, and Alice carried the piano.
  

which would mean that each of them carried the piano by himself/herself. Lojban deals with this particular linguistic phenomenon as a “mass”. John and Alice are joined together into a mass, John-and-Alice, and it is this mass which carried the piano, not either of them separately. The cmavo __joi__ (of selma'o JOI) is used to join two or more components into a mass:
**Example 14.111. **
la | djan. | joi | la | .alis. | cu | bevri | le | pipno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | massed-with | that-named | Alice |  | carry | the | piano.  
  

Example 14.111 covers the case mentioned, where John and Alice divide the labor; it also could mean that John did all the hauling and Alice did the supervising. This possibility arises because the properties of a mass are the properties of its components, which can lead to apparent contradictions: if John is small and Alice is large, then John-and-Alice is both small and large. Masses are also discussed in Section 6.3.
Grammatically, __joi__ can appear between two sumti (like an ek) or between two tanru components (like a jek). This flexibility must be paid for in the form of occasional terminators that cannot be elided:
**Example 14.112. **
le | nanmu | ku | joi | le | ninmu | [ku] | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man |  | massed-with | the | woman |  |  | go-to | the | market.  
  

The cmavo __ku__ is the elidable terminator for __le__ , which can almost always be elided, but not in this case. If the first __ku__ were elided here, Lojban's parsing rules would see _le nanmu joi_ and assume that another tanru component is to follow; since the second __le__ cannot be part of a tanru, a parsing error results. No such problem can occur with logical connectives, because an ek signals a following sumti and a jek a following tanru component unambiguously.
Single or compound cmavo involving members of selma'o JOI are called joiks, by analogy with the names for logical connectives. It is not grammatical to use joiks to connect bridi-tails.
In tanru, __joi__ has the connotation “mixed with”, as in the following example:
**Example 14.113. **
ti | blanu | joi | xunre | bolci  
---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-(blue | mixed-with | red) | ball.  
This is a blue and red ball.  
---  
  

Here the ball is neither wholly blue nor wholly red, but partly blue and partly red. Its blue/redness is a mass property. (Just how blue something has to be to count as “wholly blue” is an unsettled question, though. A _blanu zdani_ may be so even though not every part of it is blue.)
There are several other cmavo in selma'o JOI which can be used in the same grammatical constructions. Not all of them are well-defined as yet in all contexts. All have clear definitions as sumti connectives; those definitions are shown in the following table:
A __joi__ B | the mass with components A and B  
---|---  
A __ce__ B | the set with elements A and B  
A __ce'o__ B | the sequence with elements A and B in order  
A __se__ __ce'o__ B | the sequence with elements B and A in order  
A __jo'u__ B | A and B considered jointly  
A __fa'u__ B | A and B respectively  
A __se__ __fa'u__ B | B and A respectively  
A __jo'e__ B | the union of sets A and B  
A __ku'a__ B | the intersection of sets A and B  
A __pi'u__ B | the cross product of sets A and B  
A __se__ __pi'u__ B | the cross product of sets B and A  
The cmavo __se__ is grammatical before any JOI cmavo, but only useful with those that have inherent order. Here are some examples of joiks:
**Example 14.114. **
mi | cuxna | la | .alis. | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | choose | that-named | Alice | from-that-named | Frank  
ce | la | .alis. | ce | la | djeimyz.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and-member | that-named | Alice | and-member | that-named | James.  
I choose Alice from among Frank, Alice, and James.  
---  
  

The x3 place of __cuxna__ is a set from which the choice is being made. A set is an abstract object which is determined by specifying its members. Unlike those of a mass, the properties of a set are unrelated to its members' properties: the set of all rats is large (since many rats exist), but the rats themselves are small. This chapter does not attempt to explain set theory (the mathematical study of sets) in detail: explaining propositional logic is quite enough for one chapter!
In Example 14.114 we specify that set by listing the members with __ce__ joining them.
**Example 14.115. **
ti | liste | mi | ce'o | do | ce'o | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-list-of | me | and-sequence | you | and-sequence | that-named | John.  
This is a list of you, me, and John.  
---  
  

The x2 place of __liste__ is a sequence of the things which are mentioned in the list. (It is worth pointing out that _lo liste_ means a physical object such as a grocery list: a purely abstract list is _lo porsi_ , a sequence.) Here the three sumti connected by __ce'o__ are in a definite order, not just lumped together in a set or a mass.
So __joi__ , __ce__ , and __ce'o__ are parallel, in that the sumti connected are taken to be individuals, and the result is something else: a mass, a set, or a sequence respectively. The cmavo __jo'u__ serves as a fourth element in this pattern: the sumti connected are individuals, and the result is still individuals – but inseparably so. The normal Lojban way of saying that James and George are brothers is:
**Example 14.116. **
la | djeimyz. | bruna | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | is-the-brother-of | that-named | George.  
  

possibly adding a discursive element meaning “and vice versa”. However, “James and George are brothers” cannot be correctly translated as:
**Example 14.117. **
la | djeimyz. | .e | la | djordj. | bruna  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and | that-named | George | is-a-brother.  
  

since that expands to two bridi and means that James is a brother and so is George, but not necessarily of each other. If the __e__ is changed to __jo'u__ , however, the meaning of Example 14.116 is preserved:
**Example 14.118. **
la | djeimyz. | jo'u  
---|---|---  
That-named | James | in-common-with | that-named  
la | djordj. | cu | remei | bruna  
---|---|---|---|---  
George |  | are-a-twosome | type-of-brothers.  
  

The tanru _remei bruna_ is not strictly necessary in this sentence, but is used to make clear that we are not saying that James and George are both brothers of some third person not specified. Alternatively, we could turn the tanru around: the x1 place of __re__ __mei__ is a mass with two components, leading to:
**Example 14.119. **
la | djeimyz. | joi  
---|---|---  
That-named | James | massed-with  
la | djordj. | cu | bruna | remei  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George |  | are-a-brother | type-of-twosome.  
  

where __joi__ is used to create the necessary mass.
Likewise, __fa'u__ can be used to put two individuals together where order matters. Typically, there will be another __fa'u__ somewhere else in the same bridi:
**Example 14.120. **
la | djeimyz. | fa'u | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | jointly-in-order-with | that-named | George  
prami | la | meris. | fa'u | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
loves | that-named | Mary | jointly-in-order-with | that-named | Martha.  
James and George love Mary and Martha, respectively.  
---  
  

Here the information carried by the English adverb “respectively”, namely that James loves Mary and George loves Martha, is divided between the two occurrences of __fa'u__. If both uses of __fa'u__ were to be changed to __e__ , we would get:
**Example 14.121. **
la | djeimyz. | .e | la | djordj. | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and | that-named | George | love  
la | meris. | .e | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Mary | and | that-named | Martha.  
  

which can be transformed to four bridi:
**Example 14.122. **
la | djeimyz. | prami | la | meris. | .ije | la | djordj. | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | loves | that-named | Mary, | and | that-named | George | loves  
la | meris. | .ije | la | djeimyz. | prami | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Mary, | and | that-named | James | loves | that-named | Martha,  
.ije | la | djordj. | prami | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | that-named | George | loves | that-named | Martha.  
  

which represents quite a different state of affairs from Example 14.120. The meaning of Example 14.120 can also be conveyed by a termset:
**Example 14.123. **
la | djeimyz. | ce'e | la | meris. | pe'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | [plus] | that-named | Mary | [joint]  
.e | la | djordj. | ce'e | la | martas. | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | that-named | George | [plus] | that-named | Martha | loves.  
  

at the expense of re-ordering the list of names so as to make the pairs explicit. This option is not available when one of the lists is only described rather than enumerated:
**Example 14.124. **
la | djeimyz. | fa'u | la | djordj. | prami | re | mensi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and-respectively | that-named | George | love | two | sisters.  
  

which conveys that James loves one sister and George the other, though we are not able to tell which of the sisters is which.

## 16.3. Universal claims
What happens if we substitute “everything” for “something” in Example 16.7? We get:
**Example 16.15. **
Everything sees me.
  

Of course, this example is false, because there are many things which do not see the speaker. It is not easy to find simple truthful examples of so-called universal claims (those which are about everything), so bear with us for a while. (Indeed, some Lojbanists tend to avoid universal claims even in other languages, since they are so rarely true in Lojban.)
The Lojban translation of Example 16.15 is
**Example 16.16. **
ro | da | zo'u | da | viska | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X | : | X | sees | me.  
  

When the variable cmavo __da__ is preceded by __ro__ , the combination means “For every X” rather than “There is an X”. Superficially, these English formulations look totally unrelated: Section 16.6 will bring them within a common viewpoint. For the moment, accept the use of _ro da_ for “everything” on faith.
Here is a universal claim with two variables:
**Example 16.17. **
ro | da | ro | de | zo'u | da | prami | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X, | for-every | Y | : | X | loves | Y.  
Everything loves everything.  
---  
  

Again, X and Y can represent the same thing, so Example 16.17 does not mean “Everything loves everything else.” Furthermore, because the claim is universal, it is about every thing, not merely every person, so we cannot use “everyone” or “everybody” in the translation.
Note that __ro__ appears before both __da__ and __de__. If __ro__ is omitted before either variable, we get a mixed claim, partly existential like those of Section 16.2, partly universal.
**Example 16.18. **
ro | da | de | zo'u | da | viska | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X, | there-is-a-Y | : | X | sees | Y.  
Everything sees something.  
---  
  

**Example 16.19. **
da | ro | de | zo'u | da | viska | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X | such-that-for-every | Y | : | X | sees | Y.  
Something sees everything.  
---  
  

Example 16.18 and Example 16.19 mean completely different things. Example 16.18 says that for everything, there is something which it sees, not necessarily the same thing seen for every seer. Example 16.19, on the other hand, says that there is a particular thing which can see everything that there is (including itself). Both of these are fairly silly, but they are different kinds of silliness.
There are various possible translations of universal claims in English: sometimes we use “anybody/anything” rather than “everybody/everything”. Often it makes no difference which of these is used: when it does make a difference, it is a rather subtle one which is explained in Section 16.8.

## 16.5. Dropping the prenex
It isn't really necessary for every Lojban bridi involving variables to have a prenex on the front. In fact, none of the examples we've seen so far required prenexes at all! The rule for dropping the prenex is simple: if the variables appear in the same order within the bridi as they did in the prenex, then the prenex is superfluous. However, any __ro__ or __poi__ appearing in the prenex must be transferred to the first occurrence of the variable in the main part of the bridi. Thus, Example 16.9 becomes just:
**Example 16.25. **
da | viska | mi  
---|---|---  
There-is-an-X-which | sees | me.  
Something sees me.  
---  
  

and Example 16.23 becomes:
**Example 16.26. **
ro | da | poi | gerku | cu | vasxu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X | which | is-a-dog, |  | it-breathes.  
Every dog breathes.  
---  
  

You might well suppose, then, that the purpose of the prenex is to allow the variables in it to appear in a different order than the bridi order, and that would be correct. Consider
**Example 16.27. **
ro | da | poi | prenu | ku'o | de  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X | which | is-a-person, |  | there-is-a-Y  
poi | gerku | ku'o | zo'u | de | batci | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
which | is-a-dog |  | : | Y | bites | X.  
  

The prenex of Example 16.27 is like that of Example 16.18 (but with relative clauses): it notes that the following bridi is true of every person with respect to some dog, not necessarily the same dog for each. But in the main bridi part, the __de__ appears before the __da__. Therefore, the true translation is
**Example 16.28. **
Every person is bitten by some dog (or other).
  

If we tried to omit the prenex and move the __ro__ and the relative clauses into the main bridi, we would get:
**Example 16.29. **
de | poi | gerku | cu | batci | ro | da | poi | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-a-Y | which | is-a-dog |  | which-bites | every | X | which | is-a-person  
Some dog bites everyone.  
---  
  

which has the structure of Example 16.19: it says that there is a dog (call him Fido) who bites, has bitten, or will bite every person that has ever existed! We can safely rule out Fido's existence, and say that Example 16.29 is false, while agreeing to Example 16.27.
Even so, Example 16.27 is most probably false, since some people never experience dogbite. Examples like Example 16.27 and Example 16.23 (might there be some dogs which never have breathed, because they died as embryos?) indicate the danger in Lojban of universal claims even when restricted. In English we are prone to say that “Everyone says” or that “Everybody does” or that “Everything is” when in fact there are obvious counterexamples which we are ignoring for the sake of making a rhetorical point. Such statements are plain falsehoods in Lojban, unless saved by a context (such as tense) which implicitly restricts them.
How can we express Example 16.27 in Lojban without a prenex? Since it is the order in which variables appear that matters, we can say:
**Example 16.30. **
ro | da | poi | prenu | cu | se | batci | de | poi | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Every | X | which | is-a-person |  |  | is-bitten-by | some-Y | which | is-a-dog.  
  

using the conversion operator __se__ (explained in Section 5.11) to change the selbri __batci__ (“bites”) into _se batci_ (“is bitten by”). The translation given in Example 16.28 uses the corresponding strategy in English, since English does not have prenexes (except in strained “logician's English”). This implies that a sentence with both a universal and an existential variable can't be freely converted with __se__ ; one must be careful to preserve the order of the variables.
If a variable occurs more than once, then any __ro__ or __poi__ decorations are moved only to the first occurrence of the variable when the prenex is dropped. For example,
**Example 16.31. **
di | poi | prenu | zo'u  
---|---|---|---  
There-is-a-Z | which | is-a-person | :  
ti | xarci | di | di  
---|---|---|---  
this-thing | is-a-weapon | for-use-against-Z | by-Z  
This is a weapon for someone to use against himself/herself.  
---  
  

(in which __di__ is used rather than __da__ just for variety) loses its prenex as follows:
**Example 16.32. **
ti | xarci | di | poi | prenu | ku'o | di  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | is-a-weapon-for-use-against | some-Z | which | is-a-person |  | by-Z.  
  

As the examples in this section show, dropping the prenex makes for terseness of expression often even greater than that of English (Lojban is meant to be an unambiguous language, not necessarily a terse or verbose one), provided the rules are observed.

## 10.28. List of spatial directions and direction-like relations
The following list of FAhA cmavo gives rough English glosses for the cmavo, first when used without __mo'i__ to express a direction, and then when used with __mo'i__ to express movement in the direction. When possible, the gismu from which the cmavo is derived is also listed.
ca'u |  crane |  in front (of) |  forward  
---|---|---|---  
ti'a |  trixe |  behind |  backward  
zu'a |  zunle |  on the left (of) |  leftward  
ga'u |  gapru |  above |  upward(ly)  
ni'a |  cnita |  below |  downward(ly)  
ne'i |  nenri |  within |  into  
ru'u |  sruri |  surrounding |  orbiting  
pa'o |  pagre |  transfixing |  passing through  
ne'a |  |  next to |  moving while next to   
te'e |  |  bordering |  moving along the border (of)  
re'o |  |  adjacent (to) |  along  
fa'a |  farna |  towards |  arriving at  
to'o |  |  away from |  departing from  
zo'i |  |  inward (from) |  approaching  
ze'o |  |  outward (from) |  receding from  
zo'a |  |  tangential (to) |  passing (by)  
be'a |  berti |  north (of) |  northward(ly)  
ne'u |  snanu |  south (of) |  southward(ly)  
du'a |  stuna |  east (of) |  eastward(ly)  
vu'a |  |  west (of) |  westward(ly)  
Special note on __fa'a__ , __to'o__ , __zo'i__ , and __ze'o__ :
__zo'i__ and __ze'o__ refer to direction towards or away from the speaker's location, or whatever the origin is.
__fa'a__ and __to'o__ refer to direction towards or away from some other point.

## 10.18. Tense negation
Any bridi which involves tenses of selma'o PU, FAhA, or ZAhO can be contradicted by a _-nai_ suffixed to the tense cmavo. Some examples:
**Example 10.129. **
mi | punai | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past-not] | go-to | the | market.  
I didn't go to the market.  
---  
  

As a contradictory negation, Example 10.129 implies that the bridi as a whole is false without saying anything about what is true. When the negated tense is a sumti tcita, _-nai_ negation indicates that the stated relationship does not hold:
**Example 10.130. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | ca | nai  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market | [present] | [not]  
le | nu | do | klama | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | you | go-to | the | house.  
It is not true that I went to the market at the same time that you went to the house.  
---  
  

**Example 10.131. **
le | nanmu | cu | batci | le | gerku | ne'inai | le | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man |  | bites | the | dog | [within-not] | the | room.  
The man didn't bite the dog inside the room.  
---  
  

**Example 10.132. **
mi | morsi | ca'onai | le | nu | mi | jmive  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-dead | [continuitive-negated] | the | event-of | I | live.  
It is false that I am dead during my life.  
---  
  

It is also possible to perform scalar negation of whole tense constructs by placing a member of NAhE before them. Unlike contradictory negation, scalar negation asserts a truth: that the bridi is true with some tense other than that specified. The following examples are scalar negation analogues of Example 10.129 to Example 10.131:
**Example 10.133. **
mi | na'e | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [non-] | [past] | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market other than in the past.  
---  
  

**Example 10.134. **
le | nanmu | cu | batci | le | gerku | to'e | ne'i | le | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man |  | bites | the | dog | [opposite-of] | [within] | the | room.  
The man bites the dog outside the room.  
---  
  

**Example 10.135. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | na'e | ca | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market | [non-] | [present] | the | event-of  
do | klama | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
you | go-to | the | house.  
I went to the market at a time other than the time at which you went to the house.  
---  
  

**Example 10.136. **
mi | morsi | na'e | ca'o | le | nu | mi | jmive  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-dead | [non-] | [continuitive] | the | event-of | I | live.  
I am dead other than during my life.  
---  
  

Unlike _-nai_ contradictory negation, scalar negation of tenses is not limited to PU and FAhA:
**Example 10.137. **
le | verba | na'e | ri'u | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | child | [non-] | [right] | walks-on | the | ice  
The child walks on the ice other than to my right.  
---  
  

The use of _-nai_ on cmavo of TAhE and ROI has already been discussed in Section 10.9; this use is also a scalar negation.

## 9.16. CV'V cmavo of selma'o BAI with irregular forms
There are 65 cmavo of selma'o BAI, of which all but one (__do'e__ , discussed in Section 9.6), are derived directly from selected gismu. Of these 64 cmavo, 36 are entirely regular and have the form CV'V, where C is the first consonant of the corresponding gismu, and the Vs are the two vowels of the gismu. The remaining BAI cmavo, which are irregular in one way or another, are listed in the table below. The table is divided into sub-tables according to the nature of the exception; some cmavo appear in more than one sub-table, and are so noted.

## 18.19. Other uses of mekso
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
me'o |  LI |  the mekso  
---|---|---  
nu'a |  NUhA |  operator to selbri  
mai |  MAI |  utterance ordinal  
mo'o |  MAI |  higher order utterance ordinal  
roi |  ROI |  quantified tense  
So far we have seen mekso used as sumti (with __li__), as quantifiers (often parenthesized), and in MOI and ME-MOI selbri. There are a few other minor uses of mekso within Lojban.
The cmavo __me'o__ has the same grammatical use as __li__ but slightly different semantics. __li__ means “the number which is the value of the mekso ...”, whereas __me'o__ just means “the mekso ...” So it is true that:
**Example 18.128. **
li | re | su'i | re | du | li | vo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | two | plus | two | equals | the-number | four.  
2 + 2 = 4  
  

but false that:
**Example 18.129. **
me'o | re | su'i | re | du | me'o | vo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-mekso | two | plus | two | equals | the-mekso | four.  
“2 + 2”=“4”  
---  
  

since the expressions “2 + 2” and “4” are not the same. The relationship between __li__ and __me'o__ is related to that between _la djan._ , the person named John, and _zo .djan._ , the name “John”
The cmavo __nu'a__ is the inverse of __na'u__ , and allows a mekso operator to be used as a normal selbri, with the place structure:
> x1 is the result of applying (operator) to x2, x3, ...
for as many places as may be required. For example:
**Example 18.130. **
li | ni'umu | cu | nu'a | va'a | li | ma'umu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | -5 |  | is-the-operator | negation-of | the-number | +5.  
  

uses __nu'a__ to make the operator __va'a__ into a two-place bridi
Used together, __nu'a__ and __na'u__ make it possible to ask questions about mekso operators, even though there is no specific cmavo for an operator question, nor is it grammatical to utter an operator in isolation. Consider Example 18.131, to which Example 18.132 is one correct answer:
**Example 18.131. **
li | re | na'u  
---|---|---  
The-number | two | applied-to-selbri  
mo | re | du | li | vo  
---|---|---|---|---  
which-selbri? | two | equals | the-number | four.  
2 ? 2 = 4  
  

**Example 18.132. **
nu'a | su'i  
---|---  
plus  
---  
  

In Example 18.131, _na'u mo_ is an operator question, because __mo__ is the selbri question cmavo and __na'u__ makes the selbri into an operator. Example 18.132 makes the true answer __su'i__ into a selbri (which is a legal utterance) with the inverse cmavo __nu'a__. Mechanically speaking, inserting Example 18.132 into Example 18.131 produces:
**Example 18.133. **
li | re | na'u | nu'a  
---|---|---|---  
The-number | two | (the-operator | the-selbri  
su'i | re | du | li | vo  
---|---|---|---|---  
plus) | two | equals | the-number | four.  
  

where the _na'u nu'a_ cancels out, leaving a truthful bridi
Numerical free modifiers, corresponding to English “firstly”, “secondly”, and so on, can be created by suffixing a member of selma'o MAI to a digit string or a lerfu string. (Digit strings are compound cmavo beginning with a cmavo of selma'o PA, and containing only cmavo of PA or BY; lerfu strings begin with a cmavo of selma'o BY, and likewise contain only PA or BY cmavo.) Here are some examples:
**Example 18.134. **
pamai  
---  
firstly  
---  
  

**Example 18.135. **
remai  
---  
secondly  
---  
  

**Example 18.136. **
romai  
---  
all-ly  
lastly  
---  
  

**Example 18.137. **
ny.mai  
---  
nth-ly  
---  
  

**Example 18.138. **
pasomo'o  
---  
nineteenthly (higher order)  
---  
Section 19  
  

The difference between __mai__ and __mo'o__ is that __mo'o__ enumerates larger subdivisions of a text. Each __mo'o__ subdivision can then be divided into pieces and internally numbered with __mai__. If this chapter were translated into Lojban, each section would be numbered with __mo'o__. (See Section 19.7 for more on these words.)
A numerical tense can be created by suffixing a digit string with __roi__. This usage generates tenses corresponding to English “once”, “twice”, and so on. This topic belongs to a detailed discussion of Lojban tenses, and is explained further in Section 10.9.
Note: the elidable terminator __boi__ is not used between a number and a member of MAI or ROI.

## 18.2. Lojban numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
|  pa |  PA |  1  
---|---|---  
re |  PA |  2  
ci |  PA |  3  
vo |  PA |  4  
mu |  PA |  5  
|  xa |  PA |  6  
---|---|---  
ze |  PA |  7  
bi |  PA |  8  
so |  PA |  9  
no |  PA |  0  
The simplest kind of mekso are numbers, which are cmavo or compound cmavo. There are cmavo for each of the 10 decimal digits, and numbers greater than 9 are made by stringing together the cmavo. Some examples:
**Example 18.2. **
pa | re | ci  
---|---|---  
one | two | three  
123  
one hundred and twenty three  
---  
  

**Example 18.3. **
pa | no  
---|---  
one | zero  
10  
ten  
---  
  

**Example 18.4. **
pa | re | ci | vo | mu | xa | ze | bi | so | no  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
one | two | three | four | five | six | seven | eight | nine | zero  
1234567890  
one billion, two hundred and thirty-four million, five hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and ninety.  
---  
  

Therefore, there are no separate cmavo for “ten”, “hundred”, etc.
There is a pattern to the digit cmavo (except for __no__ , 0) which is worth explaining. The cmavo from 1 to 5 end in the vowels _a_ , _e_ , _i_ , _o_ , _u_ respectively; and the cmavo from 6 to 9 likewise end in the vowels _a_ , _e_ , _i_ , and _o_ respectively. None of the digit cmavo begin with the same consonant, to make them easy to tell apart in noisy environments.

## 18.8. Indefinite numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ro |  PA |  all  
---|---|---  
so'a |  PA |  almost all  
so'e |  PA |  most  
so'i |  PA |  many  
so'o |  PA |  several  
so'u |  PA |  a few  
no'o |  PA |  the typical number of  
da'a |  PA |  all but (one) of  
piro |  PA+PA |  the whole of/all of  
piso'a |  PA+PA |  almost the whole of  
piso'e |  PA+PA |  most of  
piso'i |  PA+PA |  much of  
piso'o |  PA+PA |  a small part of  
piso'u |  PA+PA |  a tiny part of  
pino'o |  PA+PA |  the typical portion of  
rau |  PA |  enough  
du'e |  PA |  too many  
mo'a |  PA |  too few  
pirau |  PA+PA |  enough of  
pidu'e |  PA+PA |  too much of  
pimo'a |  PA+PA |  too little of  
Not all the cmavo of PA represent numbers in the usual mathematical sense. For example, the cmavo __ro__ means “all” or “each”. This number does not have a definite value in the abstract: _li ro_ is undefined. But when used to count or quantify something, the parallel between __ro__ and __pa__ is clearer:
**Example 18.41. **
mi | catlu | pa | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | one | person  
  

**Example 18.42. **
mi | catlu | ro | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all | persons  
  

Example 18.41 might be true, whereas Example 18.42 is almost certainly false.
The cmavo __so'a__ , __so'e__ , __so'i__ , __so'o__ , and __so'u__ represent a set of indefinite numbers less than __ro__. As you go down an alphabetical list, the magnitude decreases:
**Example 18.43. **
mi | catlu | so'a | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | almost-all | persons  
  

**Example 18.44. **
mi | catlu | so'e | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | most | persons  
  

**Example 18.45. **
mi | catlu | so'i | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | many | persons  
  

**Example 18.46. **
mi | catlu | so'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | several | persons  
  

**Example 18.47. **
mi | catlu | so'u | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | a-few | persons  
  

The English equivalents are only rough: the cmavo provide space for up to five indefinite numbers between __ro__ and __no__ , with a built-in ordering. In particular, __so'e__ does not mean “most” in the sense of “a majority” or “more than half”.
Each of these numbers, plus __ro__ , may be prefixed with __pi__ (the decimal point) in order to make a fractional form which represents part of a whole rather than some elements of a totality. __piro__ therefore means “the whole of”:
**Example 18.48. **
mi | citka | piro | lei | nanba  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | eat | the-whole-of | the-mass-of | bread  
  

Similarly, __piso'a__ means “almost the whole of”; and so on down to __piso'u__ , “a tiny part of”. These numbers are particularly appropriate with masses, which are usually measured rather than counted, as Example 18.48 shows.
In addition to these cmavo, there is __no'o__ , meaning “the typical value”, and _pino'o_ , meaning “the typical portion”: Sometimes __no'o__ can be translated “the average value”, but the average in question is not, in general, a mathematical mean, median, or mode; these would be more appropriately represented by operators.
**Example 18.49. **
mi | catlu | no'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | a-typical-number-of | persons  
  

**Example 18.50. **
mi | citka | pino'o | lei | nanba  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | eat | a-typical-amount-of | the-mass-of | bread.  
  

__da'a__ is a related cmavo meaning “all but”:
**Example 18.51. **
mi | catlu | da'a | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all-but | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.52. **
mi | catlu | da'a | so'u | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all-but | a-few | persons  
  

Example 18.52 is similar in meaning to Example 18.43.
If no number follows __da'a__ , then __pa__ is assumed; __da'a__ by itself means “all but one”, or in ordinal contexts “all but the last”:
**Example 18.53. **
ro | ratcu | ka'e | citka | da'a | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | rats | can | eat | all-but-one | rats.  
All rats can eat all other rats.  
---  
  

(The use of __da'a__ means that Example 18.53 does not require that all rats can eat themselves, but does allow it. Each rat has one rat it cannot eat, but that one might be some rat other than itself. Context often dictates that “itself” is, indeed, the “other” rat.)
As mentioned in Section 18.3, __ma'u__ and __ni'u__ are also legal numbers, and they mean “some positive number” and “some negative number” respectively.
**Example 18.54. **
li | ci | vu'u | re | du | li | ma'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 3 | − | 2 | = |  | some-positive-number  
  

**Example 18.55. **
li | ci | vu'u | vo | du | li | ni'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 3 | − | 4 | = |  | some-negative-number  
  

**Example 18.56. **
mi | ponse | ma'u | rupnu  
---|---|---|---  
I | possess | a-positive-number-of | currency-units.  
  

All of the numbers discussed so far are objective, even if indefinite. If there are exactly six superpowers (_rairgugde_ , “superlative-states”) in the world, then _ro rairgugde_ means the same as _xa rairgugde_. It is often useful, however, to express subjective indefinite values. The cmavo __rau__ (enough), __du'e__ (too many), and __mo'a__ (too few) are then appropriate:
**Example 18.57. **
mi | ponse | rau | rupnu  
---|---|---|---  
I | possess | enough | currency-units.  
  

Like the __so'a__ -series, __rau__ , __du'e__ , and __mo'a__ can be preceded by __pi__ ; for example, _pirau_ means “a sufficient part of.”
Another possibility is that of combining definite and indefinite numbers into a single number. This usage implies that the two kinds of numbers have the same value in the given context:
**Example 18.58. **
mi | viska | le | rore | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | all-of/two | dogs.  
I saw both dogs.  
---  
  

**Example 18.59. **
mi | speni | so'ici | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | am-married-to | many/three | persons.  
I am married to three persons (which is “many” in the circumstances).  
---  
  

Example 18.59 assumes a mostly monogamous culture by stating that three is “many”.
