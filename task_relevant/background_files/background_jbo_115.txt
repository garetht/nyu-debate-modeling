## 9.3. Tagging places: FA
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
fa |  FA |  tags x1 place  
---|---|---  
fe |  FA |  tags x2 place  
fi |  FA |  tags x3 place  
fo |  FA |  tags x4 place  
fu |  FA |  tags x5 place  
fi'a |  FA |  place structure question  
In sentences like Example 9.1, it is easy to get lost and forget which sumti falls in which place, especially if the sumti are more complicated than simple names or descriptions. The place structure tags of selma'o FA may be used to help clarify place structures. The five cmavo __fa__ , __fe__ , __fi__ , __fo__ , and __fu__ may be inserted just before the sumti in the x1 to x5 places respectively:
**Example 9.8. **
fa | mi | cu | klama | fe | la | bastn. | fi | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x1= | I |  | go | x2= | that-named | Boston | x3= | that-named | Atlanta  
fo | le | dargu | fu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
x4= | the | road | x5= | the | car.  
I go to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.8, the tag __fu__ before _le karce_ clarifies that _le karce_ occupies the x5 place of __klama__. The use of __fu__ tells us nothing about the purpose or meaning of the x5 place; it simply says that _le karce_ occupies it.
In Example 9.8, the tags are overkill; they serve only to make Example 9.1 even longer than it is. Here is a better illustration of the use of FA tags for clarification:
**Example 9.9. **
fa | mi | klama | fe | le | zdani | be | mi | be'o | poi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x1= | I | go | x2= | (the | house | of | me) |  | which  
nurma | vau | fi | la | nu,IORK.  
---|---|---|---|---  
is-rural |  | x3= | that-named | New-York.  
  

In Example 9.9, the place structure of __klama__ is as follows:
x1 | agent |  _ _mi_ _  
---|---|---  
x2 | destination |  _le zdani be mi be'o poi nurma vau_  
x3 | origin |  _la nu,IORK._  
x4 | route | (empty)  
x5 | means | (empty)  
The __fi__ tag serves to remind the hearer that what follows is in the x3 place of __klama__ ; after listening to the complex sumti occupying the x2 place, it's easy to get lost.
Of course, once the sumti have been tagged, the order in which they are specified no longer carries the burden of distinguishing the places. Therefore, it is perfectly all right to scramble them into any order desired, and to move the selbri to anywhere in the bridi, even the beginning:
**Example 9.10. **
klama | fa | mi | fi | la | .atlantas. | fu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
go | x1= | I | x3= | that-named | Atlanta | x5= | the | car  
fe | la | bastn. | fo | le | dargu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston | x4= | the | road.  
Go I from Atlanta using the car to Boston via the road.  
---  
  

Note that no __cu__ is permitted before the selbri in Example 9.10, because __cu__ separates the selbri from any preceding sumti, and Example 9.10 has no such sumti.
**Example 9.11. **
fu | le | karce | fo | le | dargu | fi | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x5= | the | car | x4= | the | road | x3= | that-named | Atlanta  
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I  
Using the car, via the road, from Atlanta to Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.11 exhibits the reverse of the standard bridi form seen in Example 9.1 and Example 9.8, but still means exactly the same thing. If the FA tags were left out, however, producing:
**Example 9.12. **
le | karce | le | dargu | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | car | to-the | road | from-that-named | Atlanta  
la | bastn. | cu | klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
via-that-named | Boston |  | goes | using-me.  
The car goes to the road from Atlanta, with Boston as the route, using me as a means of transport.  
---  
  

the meaning would be wholly changed, and in fact nonsensical.
Tagging places with FA cmavo makes it easy not only to reorder the places but also to omit undesirable ones, without any need for __zo'e__ or special rules about the x1 place:
**Example 9.13. **
klama | fi | la | .atlantas. | fe | la | bastn.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A-goer | x3= | that-named | Atlanta | x2= | that-named | Boston  
fu | le | karce  
---|---|---  
x5= | the | car.  
A goer from Atlanta to Boston using the car.  
---  
  

Here the x1 and x4 places are empty, and so no sumti are tagged with __fa__ or __fo__ ; in addition, the x2 and x3 places appear in reverse order.
What if some sumti have FA tags and others do not? The rule is that after a FA-tagged sumti, any sumti following it occupy the places numerically succeeding it, subject to the proviso that an already-filled place is skipped:
**Example 9.14. **
klama | fa | mi | la | bastn. | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go | x1= | I | x2=that-named | Boston | x3=that-named | Atlanta  
le | dargu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---  
x4=the | road | x5=the | car.  
Go I to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.14, the __fa__ causes __mi__ to occupy the x1 place, and then the following untagged sumti occupy in order the x2 through x5 places. This is the mechanism by which Lojban allows placing the selbri first while specifying a sumti for the x1 place.
Here is a more complex (and more confusing) example:
**Example 9.15. **
mi | klama | fi | la | .atlantas. | le | dargu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go | x3= | that-named | Atlanta, | the | road  
fe | la | bastn. | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston, | the | car.  
I go from Atlanta via the road to Boston using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.15, __mi__ occupies the x1 place because it is the first sumti in the sentence (and is before the selbri). The second sumti, _la .atlantas._ , occupies the x3 place by virtue of the tag __fi__ , and _le dargu_ occupies the x4 place as a result of following _la .atlantas._. Finally, _la bastn._ occupies the x2 place because of its tag __fe__ , and _le karce_ skips over the already-occupied x3 and x4 places to land in the x5 place.
Such a convoluted use of tags should probably be avoided except when trying for a literal translation of some English (or other natural-language) sentence; the rules stated here are merely given so that some standard interpretation is possible.
It is grammatically permitted to tag more than one sumti with the same FA cmavo. The effect is that of making more than one claim:
**Example 9.16. **
[fa] | la | rik. | fa | la | djein. | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[x1=] | that-named | Rick | x1= | that-named | Jane | goes-to  
[fe] | le | skina | fe | le | zdani | fe | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[x2=] | the | movie | x2= | the | house | x2= | the | office  
  

may be taken to say that both Rick and Jane go to the movie, the house, and the office, merging six claims into one. More likely, however, it will simply confuse the listener. There are better ways, involving logical connectives (explained in Chapter 14), to say such things in Lojban. In fact, putting more than one sumti into a place is odd enough that it can only be done by explicit FA usage: this is the motivation for the proviso above, that already-occupied places are skipped. In this way, no sumti can be forced into a place already occupied unless it has an explicit FA cmavo tagging it.
The cmavo __fi'a__ also belongs to selma'o FA, and allows Lojban users to ask questions about place structures. A bridi containing __fi'a__ is a question, asking the listener to supply the appropriate other member of FA which will make the bridi a true statement:
**Example 9.17. **
fi'a | do | dunda | [fe] | le | vi | rozgu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[what-place]? | you | give | x2= | the | nearby | rose  
In what way are you involved in the giving of this rose?  
---  
Are you the giver or the receiver of this rose?  
  

In Example 9.17, the speaker uses the selbri __dunda__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _dunda_ _ x1 gives x2 to x3
The tagged sumti _fi'a do_ indicates that the speaker wishes to know whether the sumti __do__ falls in the x1 or the x3 place (the x2 place is already occupied by _le rozgu_). The listener can reply with a sentence consisting solely of a FA cmavo: __fa__ if the listener is the giver, __fi__ if he/she is the receiver.
I have inserted the tag __fe__ in brackets into Example 9.17, but it is actually not necessary, because __fi'a__ does not count as a numeric tag; therefore, _le vi rozgu_ would necessarily be in the x2 place even if no tag were present, because it immediately follows the selbri.
There is also another member of FA, namely __fai__ , which is discussed in Section 9.12.

## 10.22. Conversion of sumti tcita: JAI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
jai |  JAI |  tense conversion  
---|---|---  
fai |  FA |  indefinite place  
Conversion is the regular Lojban process of moving around the places of a place structure. The cmavo of selma'o SE serve this purpose, exchanging the first place with one of the others:
**Example 10.162. **
mi | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | go-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.163. **
le | zarci | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-gone-to | by-me.  
  

It is also possible to bring a place that is specified by a sumti tcita (for the purposes of this chapter, a tense sumti tcita) to the front, by using __jai__ plus the tense as the grammatical equivalent of SE:
**Example 10.164. **
le | ratcu | cu | citka | le | cirla | vi | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | rat |  | eats | the | cheese | [short-distance] | the | park.  
The rat eats the cheese in the park.  
---  
  

**Example 10.165. **
le | panka | cu | jai vi | citka | le | cirla | fai | le | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | park |  | is-the-place-of | eating | the | cheese | by | the | rat.  
The park is where the rat eats the cheese.  
---  
  

In Example 10.165, the construction JAI+tense converts the location sumti into the first place. The previous first place has nowhere to go, since the location sumti is not a numbered place; however, it can be inserted back into the bridi with __fai__ , the indefinite member of selma'o FA.
(The other members of FA are used to mark the first, second, etc. places of a bridi explicitly:
**Example 10.166. **
fa mi cu klama fe le zarci
  

means the same as
**Example 10.167. **
fe le zarci cu klama fa mi
  

as well as the simple
**Example 10.168. **
mi cu klama le zarci
  

in which the place structure is determined by position.)
Like SE conversion, JAI+tense conversion is especially useful in descriptions with LE selma'o:
**Example 10.169. **
mi | viska | le | jai vi | citka | be | le | cirla  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | place-of | eating |  | the | cheese.  
  

Here the eater of the cheese is elided, so no __fai__ appears.
Of course, temporal tenses are also usable with JAI:
**Example 10.170. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | jai | ca | morsi | be | fai | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the |  | [present] | is-dead |  | of | that-named |  “John” | .  
I know the time of John's death.  
---  
I know when John died.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 9.14. Sticky modals
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
ki |  KI |  stickiness flag  
---|---|---  
Like tenses, modals can be made persistent from the bridi in which they appear to all following bridi. The effect of this “stickiness” is to make the modal, along with its following sumti, act as if it appeared in every successive bridi. Stickiness is put into effect by following the modal (but not any following sumti) with the cmavo __ki__ of selma'o KI. For example,
**Example 9.88. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban. | bai  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban | compelled-by  
ki | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
| some-property-of | that-named | Frank.  
.ibabo | mi | tavla | bau | la | gliban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Afterward, | I | speak | in-language | that-named | English.  
  

means the same as:
**Example 9.89. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban. | bai  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban | compelled-by  
tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---  
some-property-of | that-named | Frank.  
.ibabo | mi | tavla | bau | la | gliban. | bai  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Afterward, | I | speak | in-language | that-named | English | compelled-by  
tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---  
some-property-of | that-named | Frank.  
  

In Example 9.88, __bai__ is made sticky, and so Frank's compelling is made applicable to every following bridi. __bau__ is not sticky, and so the language may vary from bridi to bridi, and if not specified in a particular bridi, no assumption can safely be made about its value.
To cancel stickiness, use the form _BAI ki ku_ , which stops any modal value for the specified BAI from being passed to the next bridi. To cancel stickiness for all modals simultaneously, and also for any sticky tenses that exist (__ki__ is used for both modals and tenses), use __ki__ by itself, either before the selbri or (in the form _ki ku_) anywhere in the bridi:
**Example 9.90. **
mi | ki | tavla  
---|---|---  
I speak (no implication about language or compulsion).  
---  
  

Note: Modals made with __fi'o__ -plus-selbri cannot be made sticky. This is an unfortunate, but unavoidable, restriction.

## 10.13. Sticky and multiple tenses: KI
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
ki |  KI |  sticky tense set/reset  
---|---|---  
So far we have only considered tenses in isolated bridi. Lojban provides several ways for a tense to continue in effect over more than a single bridi. This property is known as “stickiness”: the tense gets “stuck” and remains in effect until explicitly “unstuck”. In the metaphor of the imaginary journey, the place and time set by a sticky tense may be thought of as a campsite or way-station: it provides a permanent origin with respect to which other tenses are understood. Later imaginary journeys start from that point rather than from the speaker.
To make a tense sticky, suffix __ki__ to it:
**Example 10.82. **
mi | puki | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past-sticky] | go-to | the | market.  
.i | le | nanmu | cu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| The | man |  | bites | the | dog.  
I went to the market. The man bit the dog.  
---  
  

Here the use of _puki_ rather than just __pu__ ensures that the tense will affect the next sentence as well. Otherwise, since the second sentence is tenseless, there would be no way of determining its tense; the event of the second sentence might happen before, after, or simultaneously with that of the first sentence.
(The last statement does not apply when the two sentences form part of a narrative. See Section 10.14 for an explanation of “story time”, which employs a different set of conventions.)
What if the second sentence has a tense anyway?
**Example 10.83. **
mi | puki | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past-sticky] | go-to | the | market.  
.i | le | nanmu | pu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| The | man | [past] | bites | the | dog.  
  

Here the second __pu__ does not replace the sticky tense, but adds to it, in the sense that the starting point of its imaginary journey is taken to be the previously set sticky time. So the translation of Example 10.83 is:
**Example 10.84. **
I went to the market. The man had earlier bitten the dog.
  

and it is equivalent in meaning (when considered in isolation from any other sentences) to:
**Example 10.85. **
mi | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | go-to | the | market.  
.i | le | nanmu | pupu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| The | man | [past-past] | bites | the | dog.  
  

The point has not been discussed so far, but it is perfectly grammatical to have more than one tense construct in a sentence:
**Example 10.86. **
puku | mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[past] | I | [future] | go-to | the | market.  
Earlier, I was going to go to the market.  
---  
  

Here there are two tenses in the same bridi, the first floating free and specified by _puku_ , the second in the usual place and specified by __ba__. They are considered cumulative in the same way as the two tenses in separate sentences of Example 10.85. Example 10.86 is therefore equivalent in meaning, except for emphasis, to:
**Example 10.87. **
mi | puba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past-future] | go-to | the | market.  
I was going to go to the market.  
---  
  

Compare Example 10.88 and Example 10.89, which have a different meaning from Example 10.86 and Example 10.87:
**Example 10.88. **
mi | ba | klama | le | zarci | puku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | go-to | the | market | [past].  
I will have gone to the market earlier.  
---  
  

**Example 10.89. **
mi | bapu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future-past] | go-to | the | market.  
I will have gone to the market.  
---  
  

So when multiple tense constructs in a single bridi are involved, order counts – the tenses cannot be shifted around as freely as if there were only one tense to worry about.
But why bother to allow multiple tense constructs at all? They specify separate portions of the imaginary journey, and can be useful in order to make part of a tense sticky. Consider Example 10.90, which adds a second bridi and a __ki__ to Example 10.86:
**Example 10.90. **
pu | ki | ku | mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[past] | [sticky] |  | I | [future] | go-to | the | market.  
.i | le | nanmu | cu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| The | man |  | bites | the | dog.  
  

What is the implied tense of the second sentence? Not __puba__ , but only __pu__ , since only __pu__ was made sticky with __ki__. So the translation is:
> I was going to go to the market. The man bit the dog.
Lojban has several ways of embedding a bridi within another bridi: descriptions, abstractors, relative clauses. (Technically, descriptions contain selbri rather than bridi.) Any of the selbri of these subordinate bridi may have tenses attached. These tenses are interpreted relative to the tense of the main bridi:
**Example 10.91. **
mi | pu | klama | le | ba'o | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | go-to | the | [perfective] | market  
I went to the former market.  
---  
  

The significance of the __ba'o__ in Example 10.91 is that the speaker's destination is described as being “in the aftermath of being a market”; that is, it is a market no longer. In particular, the time at which it was no longer a market is in the speaker's past, because the __ba'o__ is interpreted relative to the __pu__ tense of the main bridi.
Here is an example involving an abstraction bridi:
**Example 10.92. **
mi | ca | jinvi | le | du'u | mi | ba | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | now | opine | the | fact-that | I | will-be | dead.  
I now believe that I will be dead.  
---  
  

Here the event of being dead is said to be in the future with respect to the opinion, which is in the present.
__ki__ may also be used as a tense by itself. This cancels all stickiness and returns the bridi and all following bridi to the speaker's location in both space and time.
In complex descriptions, multiple tenses may be saved and then used by adding a subscript to __ki__. A time made sticky with _kixipa_ (ki-sub-1) can be returned to by specifying _kixipa_ as a tense by itself. In the case of written expression, the writer's here-and-now is often different from the reader's, and a pair of subscripted __ki__ tenses could be used to distinguish the two.

## 10.21. Sub-events
Another application of non-logical tense connection is to talk about sub-events of events. Consider a six-shooter: a gun which can fire six bullets in succession before reloading. If I fire off the entire magazine twice, I can express the fact in Lojban thus:
**Example 10.159. **
mi | reroi | pi'u | xaroi | cecla  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [twice] | [cross-product] | [six-times] | shoot  
le | seldanti  
---|---  
the | projectile-launcher.  
On two occasions, I fire the gun six times.  
---  
  

It would be confusing, though grammatical, to run the __reroi__ and the _xaroi_ directly together. However, the non-logical connective __pi'u__ expresses a Cartesian product (also known as a cross product) of two sets. In this case, there is a set of two firings each of which is represented by a set of six shots, for twelve shots in all (hence the name “product”: the product of 2 and 6 is 12). Its use specifies very precisely what occurs.
In fact, you can specify strings of interval properties and event contours within a single tense without the use of a logical or non-logical connective cmavo. This allows tenses of the type:
**Example 10.160. **
la | djordj. | ca'o | co'a | ciska  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [continuitive] | [initiative] | writes.  
George continues to start to write.  
---  
  

**Example 10.161. **
mi | reroi | ca'o | xaroi | darxi | le | damri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [twice] | [continuitive] | [six-times] | hit | the | drum.  
On two occasions, I continue to beat the drum six times.

## 10.10. Event contours: ZAhO and _re'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
pu'o |  ZAhO |  inchoative  
---|---|---  
ca'o |  ZAhO |  continuitive  
ba'o |  ZAhO |  perfective  
co'a |  ZAhO |  initiative  
co'u |  ZAhO |  cessitive  
mo'u |  ZAhO |  completitive  
za'o |  ZAhO |  superfective  
co'i |  ZAhO |  achievative  
de'a |  ZAhO |  pausative  
di'a |  ZAhO |  resumptive  
re'u |  ROI |  ordinal tense  
The cmavo of selma'o ZAhO express the Lojban version of what is traditionally called “aspect”. This is not a notion well expressed by English tenses, but many languages (including Chinese and Russian among Lojban's six source languages) consider it more important than the specification of mere position in time.
The “event contours” of selma'o ZAhO, with their bizarre keywords, represent the natural portions of an event considered as a process, an occurrence with an internal structure including a beginning, a middle, and an end. Since the keywords are scarcely self-explanatory, each ZAhO will be explained in detail here. Note that from the viewpoint of Lojban syntax, ZAhOs are interval modifiers like TAhEs or ROI compounds; if both are found in a single tense, the TAhE/ROI comes first and the ZAhO afterward. The imaginary journey described by other tense cmavo moves us to the portion of the event-as-process which the ZAhO specifies.
It is important to understand that ZAhO cmavo, unlike the other tense cmavo, specify characteristic portions of the event, and are seen from an essentially timeless perspective. The “beginning” of an event is the same whether the event is in the speaker's present, past, or future. It is especially important not to confuse the speaker-relative viewpoint of the PU tenses with the event-relative viewpoint of the ZAhO tenses.
The cmavo __pu'o__ , __ca'o__ , and __ba'o__ (etymologically derived from the PU cmavo) refer to an event that has not yet begun, that is in progress, or that has ended, respectively:
**Example 10.51. **
mi | pu'o | damba  
---|---|---  
I | [inchoative] | fight.  
I'm on the verge of fighting.  
---  
  

**Example 10.52. **
la | stiv. | ca'o | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | Steve | [continuitive] | utters.  
Steve continues to talk.  
---  
  

**Example 10.53. **
le | verba | ba'o | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | child | [perfective] | walks-on | the | ice.  
The child is finished walking on the ice.  
---  
  

As discussed in Section 10.6, the simple PU cmavo make no assumptions about whether the scope of a past, present, or future event extends into one of the other tenses as well. Example 10.51 through Example 10.53 illustrate that these ZAhO cmavo do make such assumptions possible: the event in Example 10.51 has not yet begun, definitively; likewise, the event in Example 10.53 is definitely over.
Note that in Example 10.51 and Example 10.53, __pu'o__ and __ba'o__ may appear to be reversed: __pu'o__ , although etymologically connected with __pu__ , is referring to a future event; whereas __ba'o__ , connected with __ba__ , is referring to a past event. This is the natural result of the event-centered view of ZAhO cmavo. The inchoative, or __pu'o__ , part of an event, is in the “pastward” portion of that event, when seen from the perspective of the event itself. It is only by inference that we suppose that Example 10.51 refers to the speaker's future: in fact, no PU tense is given, so the inchoative part of the event need not be coincident with the speaker's present: __pu'o__ is not necessarily, though in fact often is, the same as _ca pu'o_.
The cmavo in Example 10.51 through Example 10.53 refer to spans of time. There are also two points of time that can be usefully associated with an event: the beginning, marked by __co'a__ , and the end, marked by __co'u__. Specifically, __co'a__ marks the boundary between the __pu'o__ and __ca'o__ parts of an event, and __co'u__ marks the boundary between the __ca'o__ and __ba'o__ parts:
**Example 10.54. **
mi | ba | co'a | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | [initiative] | eat | the | associated-with-me | meal.  
I will begin to eat my meal.  
---  
  

**Example 10.55. **
mi | pu | co'u | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [cessitive] | eat | the | associated-with-me | meal.  
I ceased eating my meal.  
---  
  

Compare Example 10.54 with:
**Example 10.56. **
mi | ba | di'i | co'a | bajra  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | [regularly] | [initiative] | run.  
I will regularly begin to run.  
---  
  

which illustrates the combination of a TAhE with a ZAhO.
A process can have two end points, one reflecting the “natural end” (when the process is complete) and the other reflecting the “actual stopping point” (whether complete or not). Example 10.55 may be contrasted with:
**Example 10.57. **
mi | pu | mo'u | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [completitive] | eat | the | associated-with-me | meal.  
I finished eating my meal.  
---  
  

In Example 10.57, the meal has reached its natural end; in Example 10.55, the meal has merely ceased, without necessarily reaching its natural end.
A process such as eating a meal does not necessarily proceed uninterrupted. If it is interrupted, there are two more relevant point events: the point just before the interruption, marked by __de'a__ , and the point just after the interruption, marked by __di'a__. Some examples:
**Example 10.58. **
mi | pu | de'a | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [pausative] | eat | the | associated-with-me | meal.  
I stopped eating my meal (with the intention of resuming).  
---  
  

**Example 10.59. **
mi | ba | di'a | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | [resumptive] | eat | the | associated-with-me | meal.  
I will resume eating my meal.  
---  
  

In addition, it is possible for a process to continue beyond its natural end. The span of time between the natural and the actual end points is represented by __za'o__ :
**Example 10.60. **
le | ctuca | pu | za'o | ciksi  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | teacher | [past] | [superfective] | explained  
le | cmaci | seldanfu | le | tadgri  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | mathematics | problem | to-the | student-group.  
The teacher kept on explaining the mathematics problem to the class too long.  
---  
  

That is, the teacher went on explaining after the class already understood the problem.
An entire event can be treated as a single moment using the cmavo __co'i__ :
**Example 10.61. **
la | djan. | pu | co'i | catra | la | djim  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | [achievative] | kills | that-named | Jim.  
John was at the point in time where he killed Jim.  
---  
  

Finally, since an activity is cyclical, an individual cycle can be referred to using a number followed by __re'u__ , which is the other cmavo of selma'o ROI:
**Example 10.62. **
mi | pare'u | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [first-time] | go-to | the | store.  
I go to the store for the first time (within a vague interval).  
---  
  

Note the difference between:
**Example 10.63. **
mi | pare'u | paroi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [first-time] | [one-time] | go-to | the | store.  
For the first time, I go to the store once.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.64. **
mi | paroi | pare'u | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [one-time] | [first-time] | go-to | the | store.  
There is one occasion on which I go to the store for the first time.  
---

## 10.4. Temporal tenses: PU and ZI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
pu |  PU |  past  
---|---|---  
ca |  PU |  present  
ba |  PU |  future  
zi |  ZI |  short time distance  
za |  ZI |  medium time distance  
zu |  ZI |  long time distance  
Now that the reader understands spatial tenses, there are only two main facts to understand about temporal tenses: they work exactly like the spatial tenses, with selma'o PU and ZI standing in for FAhA and VA; and when both spatial and temporal tense cmavo are given in a single tense construct, the temporal tense is expressed first. (If space could be expressed before or after time at will, then certain constructions would be ambiguous.)
**Example 10.15. **
le | nanmu | pu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [past] | bites | the | dog.  
The man bit the dog.  
---  
  

means that to reach the dog-biting, you must take an imaginary journey through time, moving towards the past an unspecified distance. (Of course, this journey is even more imaginary than the ones talked about in the previous sections, since time-travel is not an available option.)
Lojban recognizes three temporal directions: __pu__ for the past, __ca__ for the present, and __ba__ for the future. (Etymologically, these derive from the corresponding gismu __purci__ , __cabna__ , and __balvi__. See Section 10.23 for an explanation of the exact relationship between the cmavo and the gismu.) There are many more spatial directions, since there are FAhA cmavo for both absolute and relative directions as well as “direction-like relationships” like “surrounding”, “within”, “touching”, etc. (See Section 10.27 for a complete list.) But there are really only two directions in time: forward and backward, toward the future and toward the past. Why, then, are there three cmavo of selma'o PU?
The reason is that tense is subjective: human beings perceive space and time in a way that does not necessarily agree with objective measurements. We have a sense of “now” which includes part of the objective past and part of the objective future, and so we naturally segment the time line into three parts. The Lojban design recognizes this human reality by providing a separate time-direction cmavo for the “zero direction”, Similarly, there is a FAhA cmavo for the zero space direction: __bu'u__ , which means something like “coinciding”.
(Technical note for readers conversant with relativity theory: The Lojban time tenses reflect time as seen by the speaker, who is assumed to be a “point-like observer” in the relativistic sense: they do not say anything about physical relationships of relativistic interval, still less about implicit causality. The nature of tense is not only subjective but also observer-based.)
Here are some examples of temporal tenses:
**Example 10.16. **
le | nanmu | puzi | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [past-short-distance] | bites | the | dog.  
A short time ago, the man bit the dog.  
---  
  

**Example 10.17. **
le | nanmu | pu | pu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [past] | [past] | bites | the | dog.  
Earlier than an earlier time than now, the man bit the dog.  
---  
The man had bitten the dog.  
The man had been biting the dog.  
  

**Example 10.18. **
le | nanmu | ba | puzi | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [future] | [past-short] | bites | the | dog.  
Shortly earlier than some time later than now, the man will bite the dog.  
---  
Soon before then, the man will have bitten the dog.  
The man will have just bitten the dog.  
The man will just have been biting the dog.  
  

What about the analogue of an initial VA without a direction? Lojban does allow an initial ZI with or without following PUs:
**Example 10.19. **
le | nanmu | zi | pu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [short] | [past] | bites | the | dog.  
Before a short time from or before now, the man bit or will bite the dog.  
---  
  

**Example 10.20. **
le | nanmu | zu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [long] | bites | the | dog.  
A long time from or before now, the man will bite or bit the dog.  
---  
  

Example 10.19 and Example 10.20 are perfectly legitimate, but may not be very much used: __zi__ by itself signals an event that happens at a time close to the present, but without saying whether it is in the past or the future. A rough translation might be “about now, but not exactly now”.
Because we can move in any direction in space, we are comfortable with the idea of events happening in an unspecified space direction (“nearby” or “far away”), but we live only from past to future, and the idea of an event which happens “nearby in time” is a peculiar one. Lojban provides lots of such possibilities that don't seem all that useful to English-speakers, even though you can put them together productively; this fact may be a limitation of English.
Finally, here are examples which combine temporal and spatial tense:
**Example 10.21. **
le | nanmu | puzu | vu | batci | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | [past-long-time] | [long-space] | bites | the | dog.  
Long ago and far away, the man bit the dog.  
---  
  

Alternatively,
**Example 10.22. **
le | nanmu | cu | batci | le | gerku | puzuvuku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man |  | bites | the | dog | [past-long-time-long-space].  
The man bit the dog long ago and far away.  
---
