## 6.5. Descriptors for typical objects
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
lo'e |  LE |  the typical  
---|---|---  
le'e |  LE |  the stereotypical  
As promised in Section 6.3, Lojban has a method for discriminating between “the lion” who lives in Africa and “the Englishman” who, generally speaking, doesn't live in Africa even though some Englishmen do. The descriptor __lo'e__ means “the typical”, as in
**Example 6.26. **
lo'e | cinfo | cu | xabju | le | fi'ortu'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-typical | lion |  | dwells-in | the | African-land.  
The lion dwells in Africa.  
---  
  

What is this “typical lion”? Surely it is not any particular lion, because no lion has all of the “typical” characteristics, and (worse yet) some characteristics that all real lions have can't be viewed as typical. For example, all real lions are either male or female, but it would be bizarre to suppose that the typical lion is either one. So the typical lion has no particular sex, but does have a color (golden brown), a residence (Africa), a diet (game), and so on. Likewise we can say that
**Example 6.27. **
lo'e | glipre | cu | xabju  
---|---|---|---  
The-typical | English-person |  | dwells-in  
le | fi'ortu'a | na.e | le | gligugde  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | African-land | (Not!) and | the | English-country.  
The typical English person dwells not in Africa but in England.  
---  
  

The relationship between _lo'e cinfo_ and _lo'i cinfo_ may be explained thus: the typical lion is an imaginary lion-abstraction which best exemplifies the set of lions. There is a similar relationship between __le'e__ and __le'i__ :
**Example 6.28. **
le'e | xelso | merko | cu | gusta | ponse  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-stereotypical | Greek-type-of | American |  | is-a-restaurant-type-of | owner.  
Lots of Greek-Americans own restaurants.  
---  
  

Here we are concerned not with the actual set of Greek-Americans, but with the set of those the speaker has in mind, which is typified by one (real or imaginary) who owns a restaurant. The word “stereotypical” is often derogatory in English, but __le'e__ need not be derogatory in Lojban: it simply suggests that the example is typical in the speaker's imagination rather than in some objectively agreed-upon way. Of course, different speakers may disagree about what the features of “the typical lion” are (some would include having a short intestine, whereas others would know nothing of lions' intestines), so the distinction between _lo'e cinfo_ and _le'e cinfo_ may be very fine.
Furthermore,
**Example 6.29. **
le'e | skina | cu | se finti | ne'i | la | xali,uyd.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-stereotypical | movie |  | is-invented | in | that-named | Hollywood.  
  

is probably true to an American, but might be false (not the stereotype) to someone living in India or Russia.
Note that there is no naming equivalent of __lo'e__ and __le'e__ , because there is no need, as a rule, for a “typical George” or a “typical Smith”. People or things who share a common name do not, in general, have any other common attributes worth mentioning.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 8.4. Multiple relative clauses: _zi'e_
zi'e |  ZIhE |  relative clause joiner  
---|---|---  
Sometimes it is necessary or useful to attach more than one relative clause to a sumti. This is made possible in Lojban by the cmavo __zi'e__ (of selma'o ZIhE), which is used to join one or more relative clauses together into a single unit, thus making them apply to the same sumti. For example:
**Example 8.38. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | zi'e | poi | batci | le | nanmu | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The dog which is white and which bites the man goes.  
---  
  

The most usual translation of __zi'e__ in English is “and”, but __zi'e__ is not really a logical connective: unlike most of the true logical connectives (which are explained in Chapter 14), it cannot be converted into a logical connection between sentences.
It is perfectly correct to use __zi'e__ to connect relative clauses of different kinds:
**Example 8.39. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | zi'e | noi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | that-is | (white) | and | incidentally-such-that  
le | mi | pendo | cu | ponse | ke'a | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(- | my | friend |  | owns | IT | ) | goes.  
The dog that is white, which my friend owns, is going.  
---  
  

In Example 8.39, the restrictive clause _poi blabi_ specifies which dog is referred to, but the incidental clause _noi le mi pendo cu ponse_ is mere incidental information: the listener is supposed to already have identified the dog from the _poi blabi_. Of course, the meaning (though not necessarily the emphasis) is the same if the incidental clause appears first.
It is also possible to connect relative phrases with __zi'e__ , or a relative phrase with a relative clause:
**Example 8.40. **
le | botpi | po | mi | zi'e | poi | blanu | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | bottle | specific-to | me | and | which-is | blue |  | is-broken.  
My blue bottle is broken.  
---  
  

Note that if the colloquial translation of Example 8.40 were “My bottle, which is blue, is broken”, then __noi__ rather than __poi__ would have been correct in the Lojban version, since that version of the English implies that you do not need to know the bottle is blue. As written, Example 8.40 suggests that I probably have more than one bottle, and the one in question needs to be picked out as the blue one.
**Example 8.41. **
mi | ba | zutse | le | stizu | pe  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | sit-in | the | chair | associated-with  
mi | zi'e | po | do | zi'e | poi | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
me | and | specific-to | you | and | which | is-red.  
I will sit in my chair (really yours), the red one.  
---  
  

Example 8.41 illustrates that more than two relative phrases or clauses can be connected with __zi'e__. It almost defies colloquial translation because of the very un-English contrast between _pe mi_ , implying that the chair is temporarily connected with me, and _po do_ , implying that the chair has a more permanent association with you. (Perhaps I am a guest in your house, in which case the chair would naturally be your property.)
Here is another example, mixing a relative phrase and two relative clauses, a restrictive one and a non-restrictive one:
**Example 8.42. **
mi | ba | citka | le | dembi | pe | mi | zi'e | poi | cpana  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | eat | the | beans | associated-with | me | and | which | are-upon  
le | mi | palta | zi'e | noi | do | dunda | ke'a |  | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| my | plate | and | which-incidentally | you | gave | IT | to | me.  
I'll eat my beans that are on my plate, the ones you gave me.  
---

## 9.4. Conversion: SE
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
se |  SE |  2nd place conversion  
---|---|---  
te |  SE |  3rd place conversion  
ve |  SE |  4th place conversion  
xe |  SE |  5th place conversion  
So far we have seen ways to move sumti around within a bridi, but the actual place structure of the selbri has always remained untouched. The conversion cmavo of selma'o SE are incorporated within the selbri itself, and produce a new selbri (called a converted selbri) with a different place structure. In particular, after the application of any SE cmavo, the number and purposes of the places remain the same, but two of them have been exchanged, the x1 place and another. Which place has been exchanged with x1 depends on the cmavo chosen. Thus, for example, when __se__ is used, the x1 place is swapped with the x2 place.
Note that the cmavo of SE begin with consecutive consonants in alphabetical order. There is no “1st place conversion” cmavo, because exchanging the x1 place with itself is a pointless maneuver.
Here are the place structures of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the destination of x2's going from x3 via x4 using x5
and _te klama_ :
> x1 is the origin and x2 the destination of x3 going via x4 using x5
and _ve klama_ :
> x1 is the route to x2 from x3 used by x4 going via x5
and _xe klama_ :
> x1 is the means in going to x2 from x3 via x4 employed by x5
Note that the place structure numbers in each case continue to be listed in the usual order, x1 to x5.
Consider the following pair of examples:
**Example 9.18. **
la | bastn. | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Boston |  | is-the-destination | of-me.  
Boston is my destination.  
---  
Boston is gone to by me.  
  

**Example 9.19. **
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I.  
To Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.18 and Example 9.19 mean the same thing, in the sense that there is a relationship of going with the speaker as the agent and Boston as the destination (and with unspecified origin, route, and means). Structurally, however, they are quite different. Example 9.18 has _la bastn._ in the x1 place and __mi__ in the x2 place of the selbri _se klama_ , and uses standard bridi order; Example 9.19 has __mi__ in the x1 place and _la bastn._ in the x2 place of the selbri __klama__ , and uses a non-standard order.
The most important use of conversion is in the construction of descriptions. A description is a sumti which begins with a cmavo of selma'o LA or LE, called the descriptor, and contains (in the simplest case) a selbri. We have already seen the descriptions _le dargu_ and _le karce_. To this we could add:
**Example 9.20. **
le | klama  
---|---  
the go-er, the one who goes  
---  
  

In every case, the description is about something which fits into the x1 place of the selbri. In order to get a description of a destination (that is, something fitting the x2 place of __klama__), we must convert the selbri to _se klama_ , whose x1 place is a destination. The result is
**Example 9.21. **
le | se | klama  
---|---|---  
the destination gone to by someone  
---  
  

Likewise, we can create three more converted descriptions:
**Example 9.22. **
le | te | klama  
---|---|---  
the origin of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.23. **
le | ve | klama  
---|---|---  
the route of someone's going  
---  
  

**Example 9.24. **
le | xe | klama  
---|---|---  
the means by which someone goes  
---  
  

Example 9.23 does not mean “the route” plain and simple: that is _le pluta_ , using a different selbri. It means a route that is used by someone for an act of __klama__ ; that is, a journey with origin and destination. A “road” on Mars, on which no one has traveled or is ever likely to, may be called _le pluta_ , but it cannot be _le ve klama_ , since there exists no one for whom it is _le ve klama be fo da_ (the route taken in an actual journey by someone [da]).
When converting selbri that are more complex than a single brivla, it is important to realize that the scope of a SE cmavo is only the following brivla (or equivalent unit). In order to convert an entire tanru, it is necessary to enclose the tanru in __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets:
**Example 9.25. **
mi | se | ke | blanu | zdani | [ke'e] | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [2nd-conversion] | ( | blue | house | ) | this-thing  
  

The place structure of _blanu zdani_ (blue house) is the same as that of __zdani__ , by the rule given in Section 9.1. The place structure of __zdani__ is:
> _ _zdani_ _ x1 is a house/nest/lair/den for inhabitant x2
The place structure of _se ke blanu zdani [ke'e]_ is therefore:
> x1 is the inhabitant of the blue house (etc.) x2
Consequently, Example 9.25 means:
> I am the inhabitant of the blue house which is this thing.
Conversion applied to only part of a tanru has subtler effects which are explained in Section 5.11.
It is grammatical to convert a selbri more than once with SE; later (inner) conversions are applied before earlier (outer) ones. For example, the place structure of _se te klama_ is achieved by exchanging the x1 and x2 place of _te klama_ , producing:
> x1 is the destination and x2 is the origin of x3 going via x4 using x5
On the other hand, _te se klama_ has a place structure derived from swapping the x1 and x3 places of _se klama_ :
> x1 is the origin of x2's going to x3 via x4 using x5
which is quite different. However, multiple conversions like this are never necessary. Arbitrary scrambling of places can be achieved more easily and far more intelligibly with FA tags, and only a single conversion is ever needed in a description.
(Although no one has made any real use of it, it is perhaps worth noting that compound conversions of the form _setese_ , where the first and third cmavo are the same, effectively swap the two given places while leaving the others, including x1, alone: _setese_ (or equivalently _tesete_) swap the x2 and x3 places, whereas _texete_ (or _xetexe_) swap the x3 and x5 places.)

## 5.11. Conversion of simple selbri
Conversion is the process of changing a selbri so that its places appear in a different order. This is not the same as labeling the sumti with the cmavo of FA, as mentioned in Section 5.7, and then rearranging the order in which the sumti are spoken or written. Conversion transforms the selbri into a distinct, though closely related, selbri with renumbered places.
In Lojban, conversion is accomplished by placing a cmavo of selma'o SE before the selbri:
**Example 5.109. **
mi | prami | do  
---|---|---  
I love you.  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 5.110. **
do | se | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---  
You | [swap x1 and x2] | love | me.  
You are loved by me.  
---  
  

Conversion is fully explained in Section 9.4. For the purposes of this chapter, the important point about conversion is that it applies only to the following simple selbri. When trying to convert a tanru, therefore, it is necessary to be careful! Consider Example 5.111:
**Example 5.111. **
la | .alis. | cu | cadzu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | is-a-walker | type-of-goer-to | the | market.  
That-named | Alice |  | walkingly | goes-to | the | market.  
Alice walks to the market.  
---  
  

To convert this sentence so that _le zarci_ is in the x1 place, one correct way is:
**Example 5.112. **
le | zarci | cu | se  
---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-a-[swap x1/x2]  
The | market |  |   
ke | cadzu | klama | [ke'e] | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | walker | type-of-goer-to | ) | that-named | Alice.  
| is-walkingly | gone-to-by |  | that-named | Alice.  
  

The __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets cause the entire tanru to be converted by the __se__ , which would otherwise convert only __cadzu__ , leading to:
**Example 5.113. **
le | zarci | cu | se | cadzu  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | (is-a-[swap x1/x2] | walker)  
The | market |  |  | is-a-walking-surface  
klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
type-of-goer-to | that-named | Alice.  
  

whatever that might mean. An alternative approach, since the place structure of _cadzu klama_ is that of __klama__ alone, is to convert only the latter:
**Example 5.114. **
le | zarci | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice.  
  

But the tanru in Example 5.114 may or may not have the same meaning as that in Example 5.111; in particular, because __cadzu__ is not converted, there is a suggestion that although Alice is the goer, the market is the walker. With a different sumti as x1, this seemingly odd interpretation might make considerable sense:
**Example 5.115. **
la | djan. | cu | cadzu | se klama | la | .alis  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | walkingly | is-gone-to-by | that-named | Alice  
  

suggests that Alice is going to John, who is a moving target.
There is an alternative type of conversion, using the cmavo __jai__ of selma'o JAI optionally followed by a modal or tense construction. Grammatically, such a combination behaves exactly like conversion using SE. More details can be found in Section 9.12.

## 10.9. Interval properties: TAhE and _roi_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
di'i |  TAhE |  regularly  
---|---|---  
na'o |  TAhE |  typically  
ru'i |  TAhE |  continuously  
ta'e |  TAhE |  habitually  
di'inai |  TAhE |  irregularly  
na'onai |  TAhE |  atypically  
ru'inai |  TAhE |  intermittently  
ta'enai |  TAhE |  contrary to habit  
roi |  ROI |  “n” times  
roinai |  ROI |  other than “n” times  
ze'e |  ZEhA |  whole time interval  
ve'e |  VEhA |  whole space interval  
Consider Lojban bridi which express events taking place in time. Whether a very short interval (a point) or a long interval of time is involved, the event may not be spread consistently throughout that interval. Lojban can use the cmavo of selma'o TAhE to express the idea of continuous or non-continuous actions.
**Example 10.40. **
mi | puzu | ze'u | velckule  
---|---|---|---  
I | [past-long-distance] | [long-interval] | am-a-school-attendee (pupil).  
Long ago I attended school for a long time.  
---  
  

probably does not mean that I attended school continuously throughout the whole of that long-ago interval. Actually, I attended school every day, except for school holidays. More explicitly,
**Example 10.41. **
mi | puzu | ze'u | di'i | velckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past-long-distance] | [long-interval] | [regularly] | am-a-pupil.  
Long ago I regularly attended school for a long time.  
---  
  

The four TAhE cmavo are differentiated as follows: __ru'i__ covers the entirety of the interval, __di'i__ covers the parts of the interval which are systematically spaced subintervals; __na'o__ covers part of the interval, but exactly which part is determined by context; __ta'e__ covers part of the interval, selected with reference to the behavior of the actor (who often, but not always, appears in the x1 place of the bridi).
Using TAhE does not require being so specific. Either the time direction or the time interval or both may be omitted (in which case they are vague). For example:
**Example 10.42. **
mi | ba | ta'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | [habitually] | go-to | the | market.  
I | will | habitually | go to | the | market.  
I will make a habit of going to the market.  
---  
  

specifies the future, but the duration of the interval is indefinite. Similarly,
**Example 10.43. **
mi | na'o | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [typically] | go-to | the | market.  
I typically go/went/will go to the market.  
---  
  

illustrates an interval property in isolation. There are no distance or direction cmavo, so the point of time is vague; likewise, there is no interval cmavo, so the length of the interval during which these goings-to-the-market take place is also vague. As always, context will determine these vague values.
“Intermittently” is the polar opposite notion to “continuously”, and is expressed not with its own cmavo, but by adding the negation suffix _-nai_ (which belongs to selma'o NAI) to __ru'i__. For example:
**Example 10.44. **
le | verba | ru'inai | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | child | [continuously-not] | walks-on | the | ice.  
The child intermittently walks on the ice.  
---  
  

As shown in the cmavo table above, all the cmavo of TAhE may be negated with _-nai_ ; __ru'inai__ and __di'inai__ are probably the most useful.
An intermittent event can also be specified by counting the number of times during the interval that it takes place. The cmavo __roi__ (which belongs to selma'o ROI) can be appended to a number to make a quantified tense. Quantified tenses are common in English, but not so commonly named: they are exemplified by the adverbs “never”, “once”, “twice”, “thrice”, ... “always”, and by the related phrases “many times”, “a few times”, “too many times”, and so on. All of these are handled in Lojban by a number plus _-roi_ :
**Example 10.45. **
mi | paroi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [one-time] | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market once.  
---  
  

**Example 10.46. **
mi | du'eroi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [too-many-times] | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market too often.  
---  
  

With the quantified tense alone, we don't know whether the past, the present, or the future is intended, but of course the quantified tense need not stand alone:
**Example 10.47. **
mi | pu | reroi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [two-times] | go-to | the | market.  
I went to the market twice.  
---  
  

The English is slightly over-specific here: it entails that both goings-to-the-market were in the past, which may or may not be true in the Lojban sentence, since the implied interval is vague. Therefore, the interval may start in the past but extend into the present or even the future.
Adding _-nai_ to __roi__ is also permitted, and has the meaning “other than (the number specified)”:
**Example 10.48. **
le | ratcu | reroinai | citka | le | cirla  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | rat | [twice-not] | eats | the | cheese.  
The rat eats the cheese other than twice.  
---  
  

This may mean that the rat eats the cheese fewer times, or more times, or not at all.
It is necessary to be careful with sentences like Example 10.45 and Example 10.47, where a quantified tense appears without an interval. What Example 10.47 really says is that during an interval of unspecified size, at least part of which was set in the past, the event of my going to the market happened twice. The example says nothing about what happened outside that vague time interval. This is often less than we mean. If we want to nail down that I went to the market once and only once, we can use the cmavo __ze'e__ which represents the “whole time interval”: conceptually, an interval which stretches from time's beginning to its end:
**Example 10.49. **
mi | ze'e | paroi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [whole-interval] | [once] | go-to | the | market.  
  

Since specifying no ZEhA leaves the interval vague, Example 10.47 might in appropriate context mean the same as Example 10.49 after all – but Example 10.49 allows us to be specific when specificity is necessary.
A PU cmavo following __ze'e__ has a slightly different meaning from one that follows another ZEhA cmavo. The compound cmavo _ze'epu_ signifies the interval stretching from the infinite past to the reference point (wherever the imaginary journey has taken you); _ze'eba_ is the interval stretching from the reference point to the infinite future. The remaining form, _ze'eca_ , makes specific the “whole of time” interpretation just given. These compound forms make it possible to assert that something has never happened without asserting that it never will.
**Example 10.50. **
mi | ze'epu | noroi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [whole-interval-past] | [never] | go-to | the | market.  
I have never gone to the market.  
---  
  

says nothing about whether I might go in future.
The space equivalent of __ze'e__ is __ve'e__ , and it can be used in the same way with a quantified space tense: see Section 10.11 for an explanation of space interval modifiers.

## 5.16. “Pretty little girls' school”: forty ways to say it
The following examples show every possible grouping arrangement of _melbi cmalu nixli ckule_ using __bo__ or __ke__ … __ke'e__ for grouping and __je__ or __je__ __bo__ for logical connection. Most of these are definitely not plausible interpretations of the English phrase “pretty little girls' school”, especially those which describe something which is both a girl and a school.
Example 5.26, Example 5.27, Example 5.28, Example 5.29, and Example 5.36 are repeated here as Example 5.132, Example 5.140, Example 5.148, Example 5.156, and Example 5.164 respectively. The seven examples following each of these share the same grouping pattern, but differ in the presence or absence of __je__ at each possible site. Some of the examples have more than one Lojban version. In that case, they differ only in grouping mechanism, and are always equivalent in meaning.
The logical connective __je__ is associative: that is, “A and (B and C)” is the same as “(A and B) and C”. Therefore, some of the examples have the same meaning as others. In particular, Example 5.139, Example 5.147, Example 5.155, Example 5.163, and Example 5.171 all have the same meaning because all four brivla are logically connected and the grouping is simply irrelevant. Other equivalent forms are noted in the examples themselves. However, if __je__ were replaced by __naja__ or __jo__ or most of the other logical connectives, the meanings would become distinct.
It must be emphasized that, because of the ambiguity of all tanru, the English translations are by no means definitive – they represent only one possible interpretation of the corresponding Lojban sentence.

## 5.6. Logical connection within tanru
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
je |  JA |  tanru logical “and”  
---|---|---  
ja |  JA |  tanru logical “or”  
joi |  JOI |  mixed mass “and”  
gu'e |  GUhA |  tanru forethought logical “and”  
gi |  GI |  forethought connection separator  
Consider the English phrase “big red dog”. How shall this be rendered as a Lojban tanru? The naive attempt:
**Example 5.39. **
barda |  | xunre |  | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
(big | type-of | red) | type-of | dog  
  

will not do, as it means a dog whose redness is big, in whatever way redness might be described as “big”. Nor is
**Example 5.40. **
barda |  | xunre | bo | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
big | type-of | (red | type-of | dog)  
  

much better. After all, the straightforward understanding of the English phrase is that the dog is big as compared with other dogs, not merely as compared with other red dogs. In fact, the bigness and redness are independent properties of the dog, and only obscure rules of English adjective ordering prevent us from saying “red big dog”.
The Lojban approach to this problem is to introduce the cmavo __je__ , which is one of the many equivalents of English “and”. A big red dog is one that is both big and red, and we can say:
**Example 5.41. **
barda | je | xunre |  | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
(big | and | red) | type-of | dog  
  

Of course,
**Example 5.42. **
xunre | je | barda |  | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
(red | and | big) | type-of | dog  
  

is equally satisfactory and means the same thing. As these examples indicate, joining two brivla with __je__ makes them a unit for tanru purposes. However, explicit grouping with __bo__ or __ke__ … __ke'e__ associates brivla more closely than __je__ does:
**Example 5.43. **
barda | je | pelxu | bo | xunre | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
(big | and | (yellow | type-of | red)) | dog  
barda | je | ke | pelxu |  | xunre | ke'e | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(big | and | ( | yellow | type-of | red) | ) | dog  
big yellowish-red dog  
---  
  

With no grouping indicators, we get:
**Example 5.44. **
barda | je | pelxu |  | xunre |  | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
((big | and | yellow) | type-of | red) | type-of | dog  
biggish- and yellowish-red dog  
---  
  

which again raises the question of Example 5.39: what does “biggish-red” mean?
Unlike __bo__ and __ke__ … __ke'e__ , __je__ is useful as well as merely legal within simple tanru. It may be used to partly resolve the ambiguity of simple tanru:
**Example 5.45. **
ta | blanu | je | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
that | is-blue | and | is-a-house  
  

definitely refers to something which is both blue and is a house, and not to any of the other possible interpretations of simple _blanu zdani_. Furthermore, _blanu zdani_ refers to something which is blue in the way that houses are blue; _blanu je zdani_ has no such implication – the blueness of a _blanu je zdani_ is independent of its houseness.
With the addition of __je__ , many more versions of “pretty little girls' school” are made possible: see Section 5.16 for a complete list.
A subtle point in the semantics of tanru like Example 5.41 needs special elucidation. There are at least two possible interpretations of:
**Example 5.46. **
ta | melbi | je | nixli |  | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-(beautiful | and | girl) | type-of | school.  
  

It can be understood as:
**Example 5.47. **
That is a girls' school and a beautiful school.
  

or as:
**Example 5.48. **
That is a school for things which are both girls and beautiful.
  

The interpretation specified by Example 5.47 treats the tanru as a sort of abbreviation for:
**Example 5.49. **
ta | ke | melbi |  | ckule | ke'e | je | ke | nixli |  | ckule | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-( | beautiful | type-of | school | ) | and | ( | girl | type-of | school | )  
  

whereas the interpretation specified by Example 5.48 does not. This is a kind of semantic ambiguity for which Lojban does not compel a firm resolution. The way in which the school is said to be of type “beautiful and girl” may entail that it is separately a beautiful school and a girls' school; but the alternative interpretation, that the members of the school are beautiful and girls, is also possible. Still another interpretation is:
**Example 5.50. **
That is a school for beautiful things and also for girls.
  

so while the logical connectives help to resolve the meaning of tanru, they by no means compel a single meaning in and of themselves.
In general, logical connectives within tanru cannot undergo the formal manipulations that are possible with the related logical connectives that exist outside tanru; see Section 14.12 for further details.
The logical connective __je__ is only one of the fourteen logical connectives that Lojban provides. Here are a few examples of some of the others:
**Example 5.51. **
le | bajra | cu | jinga | ja | te | jinga  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the runner(s) is/are winner(s) or loser(s).  
---  
  

**Example 5.52. **
blanu | naja | lenku | skapi  
---|---|---|---  
(blue | only-if | cold) | skin  
skin which is blue only if it is cold  
---  
  

**Example 5.53. **
xamgu | jo | tordu | nuntavla  
---|---|---|---  
(good | if-and-only-if | short) | speech  
speech which is good if (and only if) it is short  
---  
  

**Example 5.54. **
vajni | ju | pluka | nuntavla  
---|---|---|---  
(important | whether-or-not | pleasing) | event-of-talking  
speech which is important, whether or not it is pleasing  
---  
  

In Example 5.51, __ja__ is grammatically equivalent to __je__ but means “or” (more precisely, “and/or”). Likewise, __naja__ means “only if” in Example 5.52, __jo__ means “if and only if” in Example 5.53, and __ju__ means “whether or not” in Example 5.54.
Now consider the following example:
**Example 5.55. **
ricfu | je | blanu | jabo | crino  
---|---|---|---|---  
rich | and | (blue | or | green)  
  

which illustrates a new grammatical feature: the use of both __ja__ and __bo__ between tanru components. The two cmavo combine to form a compound whose meaning is that of __ja__ but which groups more closely; __ja__ __bo__ is to __ja__ as plain __bo__ is to no cmavo at all. However, both __ja__ and __ja__ __bo__ group less closely than __bo__ does:
**Example 5.56. **
ricfu | je | blanu | jabo | crino | bo | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
rich | and | (blue | or | green | - | blue)  
rich and (blue or greenish-blue)  
---  
  

An alternative form of Example 5.55 is:
**Example 5.57. **
ricfu | je | ke | blanu | ja | crino | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
rich | and | ( | blue | or | green | )  
  

In addition to the logical connectives, there are also a variety of non-logical connectives, grammatically equivalent to the logical ones. The only one with a well-understood meaning in tanru contexts is __joi__ , which is the kind of “and” that denotes a mixture:
**Example 5.58. **
ti | blanu | joi | xunre | bolci  
---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-(blue | and | red) | ball.  
  

The ball described is neither solely red nor solely blue, but probably striped or in some other way exhibiting a combination of the two colors. Example 5.58 is distinct from:
**Example 5.59. **
ti | blanu | xunre | bolci  
---|---|---|---  
This is a bluish-red ball  
---  
  

which would be a ball whose color is some sort of purple tending toward red, since __xunre__ is the more important of the two components. On the other hand,
**Example 5.60. **
ti | blanu | je | xunre | bolci  
---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-(blue | and | red) | ball  
  

is probably self-contradictory, seeming to claim that the ball is independently both blue and red at the same time, although some sensible interpretation may exist.
Finally, just as English “and” has the variant form “both ... and”, so __je__ between tanru components has the variant form __gu'e__ … __gi__ , where __gu'e__ is placed before the components and __gi__ between them:
**Example 5.61. **
gu'e | barda | gi | xunre |  | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
(both | big | and | red) | type-of | dog  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 5.41. For each logical connective related to __je__ , there is a corresponding connective related to __gu'e__ … __gi__ in a systematic way.
The portion of a __gu'e__ … __gi__ construction before the __gi__ is a full selbri, and may use any of the selbri resources including __je__ logical connections. After the __gi__ , logical connections are taken to be wider in scope than the __gu'e__ … __gi__ , which has in effect the same scope as __bo__ :
**Example 5.62. **
gu'e | barda | je | xunre | gi | gerku | ja | mlatu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(both | (big | and | red) | and | dog) | or | cat  
something which is either big, red, and a dog, or else a cat  
---  
  

leaves __mlatu__ outside the __gu'e__ … __gi__ construction. The scope of the __gi__ arm extends only to a single brivla or to two or more brivla connected with __bo__ or __ke__ … __ke'e__.

## 7.2. Personal pro-sumti: the mi-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
mi |  KOhA |  mi-series |  I, me   
---|---|---|---  
do |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you  
mi'o |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and I  
mi'a |  KOhA |  mi-series |  I and others, we but not you  
ma'a |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and I and others  
do'o |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and others  
ko |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you-imperative  
The mi-series of pro-sumti refer to the speaker, the listener, and others in various combinations. __mi__ refers to the speaker and perhaps others for whom the speaker speaks; it may be a Lojbanic mass. __do__ refers to the listener or listeners. Neither __mi__ nor __do__ is specific about the number of persons referred to; for example, the foreman of a jury may refer to the members of the jury as __mi__ , since in speaking officially he represents all of them.
The referents of __mi__ and __do__ are usually obvious from the context, but may be assigned by the vocative words of selma'o COI, explained in Section 13.14. The vocative __mi'e__ assigns __mi__ , whereas all of the other vocatives assign __do__.
**Example 7.5. **
mi'e | .djan. | doi | frank. | mi | cusku | lu | mi | bajra | li'u |  | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I-am | John, | O | Frank, | I | express | [quote] | I | run | [unquote] | to | you  
I am John, Frank; I tell you “I run”.  
---  
  

The cmavo __mi'o__ , __mi'a__ , __ma'a__ , and __do'o__ express various combinations of the speaker and/or the listener and/or other people:
  * __mi'o__ includes only the speaker and the listener but no one else;
  * __mi'a__ includes the speaker and others but excludes the listener;
  * __do'o__ includes the listener and others but excludes the speaker;
  * __ma'a__ includes all three: speaker, listener, others.


All of these pro-sumti represent masses. For example, __mi'o__ is the same as _mi joi do_ , the mass of me and you considered jointly.
In English, “we” can mean __mi__ or __mi'o__ or __mi'a__ or even __ma'a__ , and English-speakers often suffer because they cannot easily distinguish __mi'o__ from __mi'a__ :
**Example 7.6. **
We're going to the store.
  

Does this include the listener or not? There's no way to be sure.
Finally, the cmavo __ko__ is logically equivalent to __do__ ; its referent is the listener. However, its use alters an assertion about the listener into a command to the listener to make the assertion true:
**Example 7.7. **
do | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
You | go-to | the | store.  
  

becomes:
**Example 7.8. **
ko | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
You [imperative] | go-to | the | store.  
Make “you go to the store” true!  
---  
Go to the store!  
  

In English, the subject of a command is omitted, but in Lojban, the word __ko__ must be used. However, __ko__ does not have to appear in the x1 place:
**Example 7.9. **
mi | viska | ko  
---|---|---  
I | see | you-[imperative]  
Make “I see you” true!  
---  
Be seen by me!  
  

In Example 7.9, it is necessary to make the verb passive in English in order to convey the effect of __ko__ in the x2 place. Indeed, __ko__ does not even have to be a sumti of the main bridi:
**Example 7.10. **
mi | viska | le | prenu | poi | prami | ko  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | person | that | loves | you-[imperative]  
Make “I see the person that loves you” true!  
---  
Be such that the person who loves you is seen by me!  
Show me the person who loves you!  
  

As mentioned in Section 7.1, some pro-sumti series have corresponding pro-bridi series. However, there is no equivalent of the mi-series among pro-bridi, since a person isn't a relationship.
