## 13.16. Tentative conclusion
The exact ramifications of the indicator system in actual usage are unknown. There has never been anything like it in natural language before. The system provides great potential for emotional expression and transcription, from which significant Sapir-Whorf effects can be anticipated. When communicating across cultural boundaries, where different indicators are often used for the same emotion, accidental offense can be avoided. If we ever ran into an alien race, a culturally neutral language of emotion could be vital. (A classic example, taken from the science fiction of Larry Niven, is to imagine speaking Lojban to the carnivorous warriors called Kzinti, noting that a human smile bares the teeth, and could be seen as an intent to attack.) And for communicating emotions to computers, when we cannot identify all of the signals involved in subliminal human communication (things like body language are also cultural), a system like this is needed.
We have tried to err on the side of overkill. There are distinctions possible in this system that no one may care to make in any culture. But it was deemed more neutral to overspecify and let usage decide, than to choose a limited set and constrain emotional expression. For circumstances in which even the current indicator set is not enough, it is possible using the cmavo __sei__ , explained in Section 19.12, to create metalinguistic comments that act like indicators.
We envision an evolutionary development. At this point, the system is little more than a mental toy. Many of you who read this will try playing around with various combinations of indicators, trying to figure out what emotions they express and when the expressions might be useful. You may even find an expression for which there currently is no good English word and start using it. Why not, if it helps you express your feelings?
There will be a couple dozen of these used pretty much universally – mostly just simple attitudinals with, at most, intensity markers. These are the ones that will quickly be expressed at the subconscious level. But every Lojbanist who plays with the list will bring in a couple of new words. Poets will paint emotional pictures, and people who identify with those pictures will use the words so created for their own experiences.
Just as a library of tanru is built up, so will a library of attitudes be built. Unlike the tanru, though, the emotional expressions are built on some fairly nebulous root emotions – words that cannot be defined with the precision of the gismu. The emotion words of Lojban will very quickly take on a life of their own, and the outline given here will evolve into a true system of emotions.
There are several theories as to the nature of emotion, and they change from year to year as we learn more about ourselves. Whether or not Lojban's additive/scalar emotional model is an accurate model for human emotions, it does support the linguistic needs for expressing those emotions. Researchers may learn more about the nature of human emotions by exploring the use of the system by Lojban speakers. They also may be able to use the Lojban system as a means for more clearly recording emotions.
The full list of scales and attitudes will probably not be used until someone speaks the language from birth. Until then, people will use the attitudes that are important to them. In this way, we counter cultural bias – if a culture is prone to recognizing and/or expressing certain emotions more than others, its members will use only those out of the enormous set available. If a culture hides certain emotions, its members simply won't express them.
Perhaps native Lojban speakers will be more expressively clear about their emotions than others. Perhaps they will feel some emotions more strongly than others in ways that can be correlated with the word choices; any difference from the norms of other cultures could be significant. Psychologists have devised elaborate tests for measuring attitudes and personality; this may be the easiest area in which to detect any systematic cultural effect of the type sought to confirm Sapir-Whorf, simply because we already have tools in existence to test it. Because Lojban is unique among languages in having such extensive and expressive indicators, it is likely that a Sapir-Whorf effect will occur and will be recognized.
It is unlikely that we will know the true potential of a system like this one until and unless we have children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking environment. We learn too many cultural habits in the realm of emotional communication “at our mother's knee”. Such children will have a Lojban system that has stronger reinforcement than any typical culture system. The second generation of such children, then, could be said to be the start of a true Lojbanic culture.
We shouldn't need to wait that long to detect significant effects. Emotion is so basic to our lives that even a small change or improvement in emotional communication would have immediately noticeable effects. Perhaps it will be the case that the most important contribution of our “logical language” will be in the non-logical realm of emotion!

## 7.15. lujvo based on pro-sumti
There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See Section 7.16 for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.
Thus __donta'a__ , meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted as _tavla be do_ , and would have the place structure
**Example 7.76. **
> t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
  

since `t2` (the addressee) is already known to be __do__.
On the other hand, the lujvo __donma'o__ , literally “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal pronoun”, would be interpreted as _cmavo be zo do_ , and have the place structure:
**Example 7.77. **
> c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
  

since both the `c2` place (the grammatical class) and the `c3` place (the meaning) are obvious from the context __do__.
An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the __fo'a__ series is to express lujvo which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An example would be:
**Example 7.78. **
fo'a | goi | le | kulnrsu,omi | .i | lo | fo'arselsanga  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x6 | stands-for | the | Finnish-culture | . | An | x6-song.  
  

Finally, lujvo involving __zi'o__ are also possible, and are fully discussed in Chapter 12. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for __zi'o__ as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a _se pinxe be zi'o_ , the lujvo corresponding to this is _zilrelselpinxe_ (deleting the second place of _se pinxe_). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that _zilpavypinxe_ has the same place structure as _zilrelselpinxe_ , and _lo zilpavypinxe_ , like _lo zilrelselpinxe_ , refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ , __du__ , and __bu'a__ also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for _du-_ based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.

## 3.10. IPA For English Speakers
There are many dialects of English, thus making it difficult to define the standardized symbols of the IPA in terms useful to every reader. All the symbols used in this chapter are repeated here, in more or less alphabetical order, with examples drawn from General American. In addition, some attention is given to the Received Pronunciation of (British) English. These two dialects are referred to as GA and RP respectively. Speakers of other dialects should consult a book on phonetics or their local television sets.
[ˈ] |  An IPA indicator of primary stress; the syllable which follows [ˈ] receives primary stress.   
---|---  
[ʔ] |  An allowed variant of Lojban _._. This sound is not usually considered part of English. It is the catch in your throat that sometimes occurs prior to the beginning of a word (and sometimes a syllable) which starts with a vowel. In some dialects, like Cockney and some kinds of American English, it is used between vowels instead of “t”: “bottle” [boʔl̩]. The English interjection “uh-oh!” almost always has it between the syllables.   
[ː] |  A symbol indicating that the previous vowel is to be spoken for a longer time than usual. Lojban vowels can be pronounced long in order to make a greater contrast with buffer vowels.   
[a] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _a_. This sound doesn't occur in GA, but sounds somewhat like the “ar” of “park”, as spoken in RP or New England American. It is pronounced further forward in the mouth than [ɑ].   
[ɑ] |  An allowed variant of Lojban _a_. The “a” of GA “father”. The sound [a] is preferred because GA speakers often relax an unstressed [ɑ] into a schwa [ə], as in the usual pronunciations of “about” and “sofa”. Because schwa is a distinct vowel in Lojban, English speakers must either learn to avoid this shift or to use [a] instead: the Lojban word for “sofa” is __sfofa__ , pronounced [sfofa] or [sfofɑ] but never [sfofə] which would be the non-word _sfofy_.   
[æ] |  Not a Lojban sound. The “a” of English “cat”.   
[b] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _b_. As in English “boy”, “sober”, or “job”.   
[β] |  An allowed variant of Lojban _v_. Not an English sound; the Spanish “b” or “v” between vowels. This sound should not be used for Lojban _b_.   
[d] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _d_. As in English “dog”, “soda”, or “mad”.   
[ɛ] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _e_. The “e” of English “met”.   
[e] |  An allowed variant of Lojban _e_. This sound is not found in English, but is the Spanish “e”, or the tense «e» of Italian. The vowel of English “say” is similar except for the off-glide: you can learn to make this sound by holding your tongue steady while saying the first part of the English vowel.   
[ə] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _y_. As in the “a” of English “sofa” or “about”. Schwa is generally unstressed in Lojban, as it is in English. It is a totally relaxed sound made with the tongue in the middle of the mouth.   
[f] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _f_. As in “fee”, “loafer”, or “chef”.   
[ɸ] |  An allowed variant of Lojban _f_. Not an English sound; the Japanese “f” sound.   
[g] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _g_. As in English “go”, “eagle”, or “dog”.   
[h] |  The preferred pronunciation of the Lojban apostrophe sound. As in English “aha” or the second "h" in “oh, hello”.   
[i] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _i_. Essentially like the English vowel of “pizza” or “machine”, although the English vowel is sometimes pronounced with an off-glide, which should not be present in Lojban.   
[ɪ] |  A possible Lojban buffer vowel. The “i” of English “bit”.   
[ɨ] |  A possible Lojban buffer vowel. The “u” of “just” in some varieties of GA, those which make the word sound more or less like “jist”. Also Russian «y» as in «byt'» (to be); like a schwa [ə], but higher in the mouth.   
[j] |  Used in Lojban diphthongs beginning or ending with _i_. Like the “y” in English “yard” or “say”.   
[k] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _k_. As in English “kill”, “token”, or “flak”.   
[l] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _l_. As in English “low”, “nylon”, or “excel”.   
[l̩] |  The syllabic version of Lojban _l_ , as in English “bottle” or “middle”.   
[m] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _m_. As in English “me”, “humor”, or “ham”.   
[m̩] |  The syllabic version of Lojban _m_. As in English “catch 'em” or “bottom”.   
[n] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _n_. As in English __no__ , “honor”, or “son”.   
[n̩] |  The syllabic version of Lojban _n_. As in English “button”.   
[ŋ] |  An allowed variant of Lojban _n_ , especially in Lojbanized names and before _g_ or _k_. As in English “sing” or “singer” (but not “finger” or “danger”).   
[ŋ̍] |  An allowed variant of Lojban syllabic _n_ , especially in Lojbanized names.   
[o] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _o_. As in the French « haute (cuisine) » or Spanish “como”. There is no exact English equivalent of this sound. The nearest GA equivalent is the “o” of “dough” or “joke”, but it is essential that the off-glide (a [w]-like sound) at the end of the vowel is not pronounced when speaking Lojban. The RP sound in these words is [əw] in IPA terms, and has no [o] in it at all; unless you can speak with a Scots, Irish, or American accent, you may have trouble with this sound.   
[ɔ] |  An allowed variant of Lojban _o_ , especially before _r_. This sound is a shortened form of the “aw” in GA “dawn” (for those people who don't pronounce “dawn” and “Don” alike; if you do, you may have trouble with this sound). In RP, but not GA, it is the “o” of “hot”.   
[p] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _p_. As in English “pay”, “super”, or “up”.   
[r] |  One version of Lojban _r_. Not an English sound. The Spanish “rr” and the Scots “r”, a tongue-tip trill.   
[ɹ] |  One version of Lojban _r_. As in GA “right”, “baron”, or “car”. Not found in RP.   
[ɾ] |  One version of Lojban _r_. In GA, appears as a variant of “t” or “d” in the words “metal” and “medal” respectively. A tongue-tip flap.   
[ʀ] |  One version of Lojban _r_. Not an English sound. The French or German « r » in « reine » or „rot“ respectively. A uvular trill.   
[r̩], [ɹ̩], [ɾ̩], [ʀ̩] |  Syllabic versions of the above. [ɹ̩] appears in the GA (but not RP) pronunciation of “bird”.   
[s] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _s_. As in English “so”, “basin”, or “yes”.   
[ʃ] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _c_. The “sh” of English “ship”, “ashen”, or “dish”.   
[ʂ] |  An allowed variant of Lojban _c_. Not an English sound. The Hindi retroflex “s” with dot below, or Klingon “S”.   
[t] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _t_. As in English “tea”, “later”, or “not”. It is important to avoid the GA habit of pronouncing the “t” between vowels as [d] or [ɾ].   
[θ] |  Not normally a Lojban sound, but a possible variant of Lojban _'_ . The “th” of English “thin” (but not “then”).   
[v] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _v_. As in English “voice”, “savor”, or “live”.   
[w] |  Used in Lojban diphthongs beginning or ending with _u_. Like the “w” in English “wet” [wɛt] or “cow” [kɑw].   
[x] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _x_. Not normally an English sound, but used in some pronunciations of “loch” and “Bach”; “gh” in Scots “might” and “night”. The German „Ach-Laut“. To pronounce [x], force air through your throat without vibrating your vocal chords; there should be lots of scrape.   
[ʏ] |  A possible Lojban buffer vowel. Not an English sound: the „ü“ of German „hübsch“.   
[z] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _z_. As in English “zoo”, “hazard”, or “fizz”.   
[ʒ] |  The preferred pronunciation of Lojban _j_. The “si” of English “vision”, or the consonant at the end of GA “garage”.   
[ʐ] |  An allowed variant of Lojban _j_. Not an English sound. The voiced version of [ʂ].

## 14.7. More than two propositions
So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.
Of the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,
**Example 14.31. **
mi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,
**Example 14.32. **
mi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that one or more of the component sentences is true.
O, however, is different. Working out the truth table for
**Example 14.33. **
mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  
  

shows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:
> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.
Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.
In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.
There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: 
**Example 14.34. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  
.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

Does this mean:
**Example 14.35. **
I like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.
  

Or is the correct translation:
**Example 14.36. **
Either I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.
  

Example 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:
**Example 14.37. **
ga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | I | like | that-named | Martha)  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas
**Example 14.38. **
ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary).  
  

is not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.

## 14.8. Grouping of afterthought connectives
There are several ways in Lojban to render Example 14.35 using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo __bo__ (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with __bo__ are interpreted before connections not so marked. Example 14.39 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.38:
**Example 14.39. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John, | and | I | like | that-named | Martha  
.ijabo | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by __.i__ __ja__ first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by __.i__ __je__.
Eks can have __bo__ attached in exactly the same way, so that Example 14.40 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39:
**Example 14.40. **
mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with __bo__ , for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.
What happens if __bo__ is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in Example 14.41?
**Example 14.41. **
mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Does this wind up meaning the same as Example 14.34 and Example 14.36? Not at all. A second rule relating to __bo__ is that where several __bo__ -marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, Example 14.41 in fact means the same as Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with __bo__ should be avoided.
The use of __bo__ , therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of Example 14.37 and Example 14.38, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ are used with ijeks, and __ke__ and __ke'e__ with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (__ke__ and __ke'e__ are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.42. **
I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
  

where the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express Example 14.42 in afterthought, we can say:
**Example 14.43. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije[bo] | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me,  
.ijanai | mi | prami | do | .ijebo | do | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | I | love | you | and | you | love | me.  
  

marking two of the ijeks with __bo__ for high precedence. (The first __bo__ is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)
But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:
**Example 14.44. **
tu'e | mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me | )  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

where the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ pairs set off the structure. The cmavo __tu'u__ is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in Example 14.44 is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.
In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to __bo__ grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.
Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:
**Example 14.45. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider
**Example 14.46. **
I walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.
  

Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to Example 14.44, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with __ke__ , so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing Example 14.47, which is instead parallel to Example 14.45:
**Example 14.47. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | the | house  
.a | ke | le | ckule | .e | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | the | school | and | the | office | ).  
  

If sumti were allowed to begin with __ke__ , unavoidable ambiguities would result, so __ke__ grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to __tu'e__ grouping of bridi, as Example 14.44 shows.
Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of Example 14.33: “I am German, rich, and a man – or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:
**Example 14.48. **
[tu'e] | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-rich | )  
.ije | tu'e | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | nanmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | ( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-a-man | ).  
  

The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.

## 15.4. selbri and tanru negation
All the scalar negations illustrated in Section 15.3 are expressed in Lojban using the cmavo __na'e__ (of selma'o NAhE). The most common use of __na'e__ is as a prefix to the selbri:
**Example 15.44. **
mi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 15.45. **
mi | na'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | (other-than | go-to) | the | market.  
  

Comparing these two, we see that the negation operator being used in Example 15.45 is __na'e__. But what exactly does __na'e__ negate? Does the negation include only the gismu __klama__ , which is the entire selbri in this case, or does it include the _le zarci_ as well? In Lojban, the answer is unambiguously “only the gismu”. The cmavo __na'e__ always applies only to what follows it.
Example 15.45 looks as if it were parallel to:
**Example 15.46. **
mi | na | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [false] | go-to | the | market.  
  

but in fact there is no real parallelism at all. A negation using __na__ denies the truth of a relationship, but a selbri negation with __na'e__ asserts that a relationship exists other than that stated, one which specifically involves the sumti identified in the statement. The grammar allotted to __na'e__ allows us to unambiguously express scalar negations in terms of scope, scale, and range within the scale. Before we explain the scalar aspects, let us show how the scope of __na'e__ is determined.
In tanru, we may wish to negate an individual element before combining it with another to form the tanru. We in effect need a shorter-than-selbri-scope negation, for which we can use __na'e__ as well. The positive sentence
**Example 15.47. **
mi | cadzu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | walking-ly | go-to | the | market.  
  

can be subjected to selbri negation in several ways. Two are:
**Example 15.48. **
mi | na'e | cadzu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | (other-than | walkingly) | go-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 15.49. **
mi | cadzu | na'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walkingly | (other-than | go-to) | the | market.  
  

These negations show the default scope of __na'e__ is close-binding on an individual brivla in a tanru. Example 15.48 says that I am going to the market, but in some kind of a non-walking manner. (As with most tanru, there are a few other possible interpretations, but we'll assume this one – see Chapter 5 for a discussion of tanru meaning).
In neither Example 15.48 nor Example 15.49 does the __na'e__ negate the entire selbri. While both sentences contain negations that deny a particular relationship between the sumti, they also have a component which makes a positive claim about such a relationship. This is clearer in Example 15.48, which says that I am going, but in a non-walking manner. In Example 15.49, we have claimed that the relationship between me and the market in some way involves walking, but is not one of “going to” (perhaps we are walking around the market, or walking-in-place while at the market).
The “scale”, or actually the “set”, implied in Lojban tanru negations is anything which plausibly can be substituted into the tanru. (Plausibility here is interpreted in the same way that answers to a __mo__ question must be plausible – the result must not only have the right number of places and have sumti values appropriate to the place structure, it must also be appropriate or relevant to the context.) This minimal condition allows a speaker to be intentionally vague, while still communicating meaningful information. The speaker who uses selbri negation is denying one relationship, while minimally asserting a different relationship.
We also need a scalar negation form that has a scope longer than a single brivla. There exists such a longer-scope selbri negation form, as exemplified by (each Lojban sentence in the next several examples is given twice, with parentheses in the second copy showing the scope of the __na'e__):
**Example 15.50. **
mi | na'e | ke | cadzu | klama | [ke'e] | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
mi | na'e | (ke | cadzu | klama | [ke'e]) | le | zarci  
I | other-than | ( | walkingly | go-to | ) | the | market.  
  

This negation uses the same __ke__ and __ke'e__ delimiters (the __ke'e__ is always elidable at the end of a selbri) that are used in tanru. The sentence clearly negates the entire selbri. The __ke'e__ , whether elided or not, reminds us that the negation does not include the trailing sumti. While the trailing-sumti place-structure is defined as that of the final brivla, the trailing sumti themselves are not part of the selbri and are thus not negated by __na'e__.
Negations of just part of the selbri are also permitted:
**Example 15.51. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | ke'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
mi | na'e | (ke | sutra | cadzu | ke'e) | klama | le | zarci  
I | other-than | ( | quickly | walkingly | ) | go-to | the | market.  
  

In Example 15.51, only the _sutra cadzu_ tanru is negated, so the speaker is indeed going to the market, but not by walking quickly.
Negations made with __na'e__ or _na'eke_ also include within their scope any sumti attached to the brivla or tanru with __be__ or __bei__. Such attached sumti are considered part of the brivla or tanru:
**Example 15.52. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | le | mi | birka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | other-than | ( | quickly | walking | on | the | of-me | arms-ly  
ke'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
) | go-to | the | market.  
  

Note that Example 15.53 and Example 15.54 do not express the same thing:
**Example 15.53. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | [ke'e] | lemi | birka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
mi | na'e | (ke | sutra | cadzu | [ke'e]) | lemi | birka  
I | other-than | ( | quickly | walk-on | ) | my | arms.  
  

**Example 15.54. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | lemi | birka | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
mi | na'e | (ke | sutra | cadzu | be | lemi | birka | [ke'e])  
I | other-than | ( | quickly | walk | on | my | arms | ).  
  

The translations show that the negation in Example 15.53 is more restricted in scope; i.e. less of the sentence is negated with respect to x1 (__mi__).
Logical scope being an important factor in Lojban's claims to be unambiguous, let us indicate the relative precedence of __na'e__ as an operator. Grouping with __ke__ and __ke'e__ , of course, has an overt scope, which is its advantage. __na'e__ is very close binding to its brivla. Internal binding of tanru, with __bo__ , is not as tightly bound as __na'e__. __co__ , the tanru inversion operator has a scope that is longer than all other tanru constructs.
In short, __na'e__ and _na'eke_ define a type of negation, which is shorter in scope than bridi negation, and which affects all or part of a selbri. The result of __na'e__ negation remains an assertion of some specific truth and not merely a denial of another claim.
The similarity becomes striking when it is noticed that the rafsi _-nal-_ , representing __na'e__ when a tanru is condensed into a lujvo, forms an exact parallel to the English usage of _non-_. Turning a series of related negations into lujvo gives:
**Example 15.55. **
  * na'e klama becomes nalkla
  * na'e cadzu klama becomes naldzukla
  * na'e sutra cadzu klama becomes nalsu'adzukla
  * nake sutra cadzu ke'e klama becomes nalsu'adzuke'ekla


  

Note: _-kem-_ is the rafsi for __ke__ , but it is omitted in the final lujvo as superfluous – __ke'e__ is its own rafsi, and its inclusion in the lujvo implies a __ke__ after the _-nal-_ , since it needs to close something; only a __ke__ immediately after the negation would make the __ke'e__ meaningful in the tanru expressed in this lujvo.
In a lujvo, it is probably clearest to translate _-nal-_ as “non-”, to match the English combining forms, except when the __na'e__ has single word scope and English uses “un-” or “im-” to negate that single word. Translation style should determine the use of “other than”, “non-”, or another negator for __na'e__ in tanru; the translator must render the Lojban into English so it is clear in context. Let's go back to our simplest example:
**Example 15.56. **
mi | na'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | other-than | (go-to) | the | market.  
I | not | go-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 15.57. **
mi | nalkla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | am-a-non-go-er-to | the | market.  
  

Note that to compare with the English translation form using “non-”, we've translated the Lojban as if the selbri were a noun. Since Lojban __klama__ is indifferently a noun, verb, or adjective, the difference is purely a translation change, not a true change in meaning. The English difference seems significant, though, due to the strongly different English grammatical forms and the ambiguity of English negation.
Consider the following highly problematic sentence:
**Example 15.58. **
lo | ca | nolraitru  
---|---|---  
An-actual | currently | noblest-governor  
be | le | fasygu'e | cu | krecau  
---|---|---|---|---  
of | the | French-country |  | is-hair-without.  
The current King of France is bald.  
---  
  

The selbri __krecau__ negates with __na'e__ as:
**Example 15.59. **
lo | ca | nolraitru  
---|---|---  
An-actual | currently | noblest-governor  
be | le | fasygu'e | cu | na'e | krecau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
of | the | French-country |  | is-other-than | hair-without.  
The current King of France is other-than-bald.  
---  
  

or, as a lujvo:
**Example 15.60. **
lo | ca | nolraitru  
---|---|---  
An-actual | currently | noblest-governor  
be | le | fasygu'e | cu | nalkrecau  
---|---|---|---|---  
of | the | French-country |  | is-non-hair-without.  
The current King of France is a non-bald-one.  
---  
  

Example 15.59 and Example 15.60 express the predicate negation forms using a negation word (__na'e__) or rafsi (_-nal-_); yet they make positive assertions about the current King of France; ie., that he is other-than-bald or non-bald. This follows from the close binding of __na'e__ to the brivla. The lujvo form makes this overt by absorbing the negative marker into the word.
Since there is no current King of France, it is false to say that he is bald, or non-bald, or to make any other affirmative claim about him. Any sentence about the current King of France containing only a selbri negation is as false as the sentence without the negation. No amount of selbri negations have any effect on the truth value of the sentence, which is invariably “false”, since no affirmative statement about the current King of France can be true. On the other hand, bridi negation does produce a truth:
**Example 15.61. **
lo | ca | nolraitru  
---|---|---  
An-actual | current | noblest-governor  
be | le | fasygu'e | cu | na | krecau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
of | the | French-country |  | [false] | is-hair-without.  
It is false that the current King of France is bald.  
---  
  

Note: __lo__ is used in these sentences because negation relates to truth conditions. To meaningfully talk about truth conditions in sentences carrying a description, it must be clear that the description actually applies to the referent. A sentence using __le__ instead of __lo__ can be true even if there is no current king of France, as long as the speaker and the listener agree to describe something as the current king of France. (See the explanations of __le__ in Section 6.2.)

## 15.5. Expressing scales in selbri negation
In expressing a scalar negation, we can provide some indication of the scale, range, frame-of-reference, or universe of discourse that is being dealt with in an assertion. As stated in Section 15.4, the default is the set of plausible alternatives. Thus if we say:
**Example 15.62. **
le | stizu | cu | na'e | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | is-a-non- | (red-thing).  
  

the pragmatic interpretation is that we mean a different color and not
**Example 15.63. **
le | stizu | cu | dzukla | be | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | walkingly-goes | to | the | market.  
  

However, if we have reason to be more explicit (an obtuse or contrary listener, or simply an overt logical analysis), we can clarify that we are referring to a color by saying:
**Example 15.64. **
le | stizu | cu | na'e | xunre | skari  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | (is-of-a-non | red) | color.  
  

We might also have reduced the pragmatic ambiguity by making the two trailing sumti values explicit (the “as perceived by” and “under conditions” places have been added to the place structure of __xunre__). But assume we have a really stubborn listener (an artificially semi-intelligent computer?) who will find a way to misinterpret Example 15.64 even with three specific sumti provided.
In this case, we use a sumti tagged with the sumti tcita __ci'u__ , which translates roughly as “on a scale of X”, where `X` is the sumti. For maximal clarity, the tagged sumti can be bound into the negated selbri with __be__. To clarify Example 15.64, we might say:
**Example 15.65. **
le | stizu | cu | na'e | xunre | be | ci'u | loka | skari  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | is-non | (red | on | a-scale-of | a-property | color-ness).  
  

We can alternately use the sumti tcita __teci'e__ , based on __ciste__ , which translates roughly as “of a system of components X”, for universes of discourse; in this case, we would express Example 15.64 as:
**Example 15.66. **
le | stizu | cu | na'e | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | is-a-non | (red  
be | teci'e | le | skari  
---|---|---|---  
of | a-system | with-components-the | colors)-thing.  
  

Other places of __ciste__ can be brought out using the grammar of selma'o BAI modals, allowing slightly different forms of expression, thus:
**Example 15.67. **
le | stizu | cu | na'e | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | is-a-non | (red  
be | ci'e | lo'i | skari  
---|---|---|---  
of | a-system | which-is-the-set-of | colors)-thing.  
  

The cmavo __le'a__ , also in selma'o BAI, can be used to specify a category:
**Example 15.68. **
le | stizu | cu | na'e | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | is-a-non | (red  
be | le'a | lo'i | skari  
---|---|---|---  
of | a-category | which-is-the-set-of | colors)-thing.  
  

which is minimally different in meaning from Example 15.67.
The cmavo __na'e__ is not the only member of selma'o NAhE. If we want to express a scalar negation which is a polar opposite, we use the cmavo __to'e__ , which is grammatically equivalent to __na'e__ :
**Example 15.69. **
le | stizu | cu | to'e | xunre | be | ci'u | loka | skari  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | is-a-(opposite-of | red) | on | scale | a-property-of | color-ness.  
  

Likewise, the midpoint of a scale can be expressed with the cmavo __no'e__ , also grammatically equivalent to __na'e__. Here are some parallel examples of __na'e__ , __no'e__ , and __to'e__ :
**Example 15.70. **
ta | melbi  
---|---  
That | is-beautiful.  
  

**Example 15.71. **
ta | na'e | melbi  
---|---|---  
That | is-other-than | beautiful.  
That is ugly [in one sense].  
---  
  

**Example 15.72. **
ta | no'e | melbi  
---|---|---  
That | is-neutrally | beautiful.  
That is plain/ordinary-looking (neither ugly nor beautiful).  
---  
  

**Example 15.73. **
ta | to'e | melbi  
---|---|---  
That | is-opposite-of | beautiful.  
That is ugly/very ugly/repulsive.  
---  
  

The cmavo __to'e__ has the assigned rafsi _-tol-_ and _-to'e-_ ; the cmavo __no'e__ has the assigned rafsi _-nor-_ and _-no'e-_. The selbri in Example 15.71 through Example 15.73 could be replaced by the lujvo _nalmle_ , _normle_ , and __tolmle__ respectively.
This large variety of scalar negations is provided because different scales have different properties. Some scales are open-ended in both directions: there is no “ultimately ugly” or “ultimately beautiful”. Other scales, like temperature, are open at one end and closed at the other: there is a minimum temperature (so-called “absolute zero”) but no maximum temperature. Still other scales are closed at both ends.
Correspondingly, some selbri have no obvious __to'e__ \- what is the opposite of a dog? – while others have more than one, and need __ci'u__ to specify which opposite is meant.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 10.15. Tenses in subordinate bridi
English has a set of rules, formally known as “sequence of tense rules”, for determining what tense should be used in a subordinate clause, depending on the tense used in the main sentence. Here are some examples:
**Example 10.100. **
John says that George is going to the market.
  

**Example 10.101. **
John says that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.102. **
John said that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.103. **
John said that George had gone to the market.
  

In Example 10.100 and Example 10.101, the tense of the main sentence is the present: “says”. If George goes when John speaks, we get the present tense “is going” (“goes” would be unidiomatic); if George goes before John speaks, we get the past tense “went”. But if the tense of the main sentence is the past, with “said”, then the tense required in the subordinate clause is different. If George goes when John speaks, we get the past tense “went”; if George goes before John speaks, we get the past-perfect tense “had gone”.
The rule of English, therefore, is that both the tense of the main sentence and the tense of the subordinate clause are understood relative to the speaker of the main sentence (not John, but the person who speaks Example 10.100 through Example 10.103).
Lojban, like Russian and Esperanto, uses a different convention. A tense in a subordinate bridi is understood to be relative to the tense already set in the main bridi. Thus Example 10.100 through Example 10.103 can be expressed in Lojban respectively thus:
**Example 10.104. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.105. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.106. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.107. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

Probably the most counterintuitive of the Lojban examples is Example 10.106. The __ca__ looks quite odd, as if George were going to the market right now, rather than back when John spoke. But this __ca__ is really a __ca__ with respect to a reference point specified by the outer __pu__. This behavior is the same as the additive behavior of multiple tenses in the same bridi, as explained in Section 10.13.
There is a special cmavo __nau__ (of selma'o CUhE) which can be used to override these rules and get to the speaker's current reference point. (Yes, it sounds like English “now”.) It is not grammatical to combine __nau__ with any other cmavo in a tense, except by way of a logical or non-logical connection (see Section 10.20). Here is a convoluted sentence with several nested bridi which uses __nau__ at the lowest level:
**Example 10.108. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | .alis | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | maris. | nau | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Mary | [now] | goes-to | the | market.  
John said that Alice had said that George had earlier said that Mary is now going to the market.  
---  
  

The use of __nau__ does not affect sticky tenses.

## 11.7. Predication/sentence abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
du'u |  NU |  predication abstraction  
---|---|---  
There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:
**Example 11.42. **
I know that Frank is a fool.
  

How's that in Lojban? Let us try:
**Example 11.43. **
mi | djuno | le | nu | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the event of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can't be contained inside one's mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; Example 11.43 comes close to claiming that Frank's being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, Example 11.43 is an instance of improperly marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in Section 11.10).
Try again:
**Example 11.44. **
mi | djuno | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Closer. Example 11.44 says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn't say that he is one, as Example 11.42 does. To catch that nuance, we must say:
**Example 11.45. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the predication that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a fool” is not a property of _le du'u_ abstraction, but of __djuno__ ; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, __djuno__ like __jei__ has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) Example 11.46 has no such implied assertion:
**Example 11.46. **
mi | kucli | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

and here __du'u__ could probably be replaced by __jei__ without much change in meaning:
**Example 11.47. **
mi | kucli | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about how true it is that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, __du'u__ has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:
> _ _du'u_ _ x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2
and _le se du'u ..._ is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:
**Example 11.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | le | se du'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses | the | (sentence-expressing-that  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes-to | the | store | )  
John says that George goes to the store.  
---  
  

Example 11.48 differs from
**Example 11.49. **
la | djan | cusku | lu  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses, | quote,  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes | to-the | store, | unquote.  
John says “George goes to the store”.  
---  
  

because Example 11.49 claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas Example 11.48 claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.
_le se du'u_ is much the same as _lu'e le du'u_ , a symbol for the predication, but _se du'u_ can be used as a selbri, whereas __lu'e__ is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See Section 6.10 for a discussion of __lu'e__.)

## 7.9. sumti and bridi questions: _ma_ and _mo_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ma |  KOhA |  sumti question  
---|---|---  
mo |  GOhA |  bridi question  
Lojban questions are more fully explained in Section 19.5, but __ma__ and __mo__ are listed in this chapter for completeness. The cmavo __ma__ asks for a sumti to make the bridi true:
**Example 7.63. **
do | klama | ma  
---|---|---  
You | go-to | what?  
Where are you going?  
---  
  

The cmavo __mo__ , on the other hand, asks for a selbri which makes the question bridi true. If the answer is a full bridi, then the arguments of the answer override the arguments in the question, in the same manner as the go'i-series cmavo. A simple example is:
**Example 7.64. **
do mo  
---  
What predicate is true as applied to you?  
---  
How are you?  
What are you doing?  
What are you?  
  

Example 7.65 is a truly pregnant question that will have several meanings depending on context.
(One thing it probably does not mean is “Who are you?” in the sense “What is your name/identity?”, which is better expressed by:
**Example 7.65. **
ma | cmene | do  
---|---|---  
What-sumti | is-the-name-of | you?  
What is your name?  
---  
  

or even
**Example 7.66. **
doi | ma  
---|---  
O | [what sumti?]  
  

which uses the vocative __doi__ to address someone, and simultaneously asks who the someone is.)
A further example of __mo__ :
**Example 7.67. **
lo | mo |  | prenu | cu | darxi | do | .i | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | [what selbri?] | type-of | person |  | hit | you? |  | A big thing.  
Which person hit you? The big one.  
---  
  

When __ma__ or __mo__ is repeated, multiple questions are being asked simultaneously:
**Example 7.68. **
ma | djuno | ma  
---|---|---  
[What-sumti] | knows | [what-sumti]?  
Who knows what?  
---

## 19.5. Questions and answers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
xu |  UI |  truth question  
---|---|---  
ma |  KOhA |  sumti question  
mo |  GOhA |  bridi question  
xo |  PA |  number question  
ji |  A |  sumti connective question  
ge'i |  GA |  forethought connective question  
gi'i |  GIhA |  bridi-tail connective question  
gu'i |  GUhA |  tanru forethought connective question  
je'i |  JA |  tanru connective question  
pei |  UI |  attitude question  
fi'a |  FA |  place structure question  
cu'e |  CUhE |  tense/modal question  
pau |  UI |  question premarker  
Lojban questions are not at all like English questions. There are two basic types: truth questions, of the form “Is it true that ...”, and fill-in-the-blank questions. Truth questions are marked by preceding the bridi, or following any part of it specifically questioned, with the cmavo __xu__ (of selma'o UI):
**Example 19.13. **
xu | do | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
[True-or-false?] | You | go-to | the | store  
Are you going to the store/Did you go to the store?  
---  
  

(Since the Lojban is tenseless, either colloquial translation might be correct.) Truth questions are further discussed in Section 15.8.
Fill-in-the-blank questions have a cmavo representing some Lojban word or phrase which is not known to the questioner, and which the answerer is to supply. There are a variety of cmavo belonging to different selma'o which provide different kinds of blanks.
Where a sumti is not known, a question may be formed with __ma__ (of selma'o KOhA), which is a kind of pro-sumti:
**Example 19.14. **
ma | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
[What-sumti?] | goes-to | the | store  
Who is going to the store?  
---  
  

Of course, the __ma__ need not be in the x1 place:
**Example 19.15. **
do | klama | ma  
---|---|---  
You | go-to | [what-sumti?]  
Where are you going?  
---  
  

The answer is a simple sumti:
**Example 19.16. **
le zarci  
---  
The store.  
---  
  

A sumti, then, is a legal utterance, although it does not by itself constitute a bridi – it does not claim anything, but merely completes the open-ended claim of the previous bridi.
There can be two __ma__ cmavo in a single question:
**Example 19.17. **
ma klama ma  
---  
Who goes where?  
---  
  

and the answer would be two sumti, which are meant to fill in the two __ma__ cmavo in order:
**Example 19.18. **
mi | le | zarci  
---|---|---  
I, | [to]-the | store.  
  

An even more complex example, depending on the non-logical connective __fa'u__ (of selma'o JOI), which is like the English “and ... respectively”:
**Example 19.19. **
ma | fa'u | ma | klama | ma | fa'u | ma  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Who and who goes where and where, -respectively?  
---  
  

An answer might be
**Example 19.20. **
la | djan. | la | marcas. | le | zarci | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John, |  | Marsha, | the | store, | the | office.  
John and Marsha go to the store and the office, respectively.  
---  
  

(Note: A mechanical substitution of Example 19.20 into Example 19.19 produces an ungrammatical result, because _* ... le zarci fa'u le briju_ is ungrammatical Lojban: the first _le zarci_ has to be closed with its proper terminator __ku__ , for reasons explained in Section 14.14. This effect is not important: Lojban behaves as if all elided terminators have been supplied in both question and answer before inserting the latter into the former. The exchange is grammatical if question and answer are each separately grammatical.)
Questions to be answered with a selbri are expressed with __mo__ of selma'o GOhA, which is a kind of pro-bridi:
**Example 19.21. **
la | lojban. | mo  
---|---|---  
| Lojban | [what-selbri?]  
What is Lojban?  
---  
  

Here the answerer is to supply some predicate which is true of Lojban. Such questions are extremely open-ended, due to the enormous range of possible predicate answers. The answer might be just a selbri, or might be a full bridi, in which case the sumti in the answer override those provided by the questioner. To limit the range of a __mo__ question, make it part of a tanru.
Questions about numbers are expressed with __xo__ of selma'o PA:
**Example 19.22. **
do | viska | xo | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
You | saw | [what-number?] | persons.  
How many people did you see?  
---  
  

The answer would be a simple number, another kind of non-bridi utterance:
**Example 19.23. **
vomu  
---  
Forty-five.  
  

Fill-in-the-blank questions may also be asked about: logical connectives (using cmavo __ji__ of A, __ge'i__ of GA, __gi'i__ of GIhA, __gu'i__ of GUhA, or __je'i__ of JA, and receiving an ek, gihek, ijek, or ijoik as an answer) – see Section 14.13; attitudes (using __pei__ of UI, and receiving an attitudinal as an answer) – see Section 13.10; place structures (using __fi'a__ of FA, and receiving a cmavo of FA as an answer) – see Section 9.3; tenses and modals (using __cu'e__ of CUhE, and receiving any tense or BAI cmavo as an answer) – see Section 9.6 and Chapter 10.
Questions can be marked by placing __pau__ (of selma'o UI) before the question bridi. See Section 13.13 for details.
The full list of non-bridi utterances suitable as answers to questions is:
  * any number of sumti (with elidable terminator __vau__ , see Chapter 6)
  * an ek or gihek (logical connectives, see Chapter 14)
  * a number, or any mathematical expression placed in parentheses (see Chapter 18)
  * a bare __na__ negator (to negate some previously expressed bridi), or corresponding __ja'a__ affirmer (see Chapter 15)
  * a relative clause (to modify some previously expressed sumti, see Chapter 8)
  * a prenex/topic (to modify some previously expressed bridi, see Chapter 16)
  * linked arguments (beginning with __be__ or __bei__ and attached to some previously expressed selbri, often in a description, see Section 5.7)


At the beginning of a text, the following non-bridi are also permitted:
  * one or more names (to indicate direct address without __doi__ , see Chapter 6)
  * indicators (to express a prevailing attitude, see Chapter 13)
  * __nai__ (to vaguely negate something or other, see Section 15.7)


Where not needed for the expression of answers, most of these are made grammatical for pragmatic reasons: people will say them in conversation, and there is no reason to rule them out as ungrammatical merely because most of them are vague.

## 11.8. Indirect questions
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
kau |  UI |  indirect question marker  
---|---|---  
There is an alternative type of sentence involving __du'u__ and a selbri expressing a propositional attitude. In addition to sentences like
**Example 11.50. **
I know that John went to the store.
  

we can also say things like
**Example 11.51. **
I know who went to the store.
  

This form is called an “indirect question” in English because the embedded English sentence is a question: “Who went to the store?” A person who says Example 11.51 is claiming to know the answer to this question. Indirect questions can occur with many other English verbs as well: I can wonder, or doubt, or see, or hear, as well as know who went to the store.
To express indirect questions in Lojban, we use a _le du'u_ abstraction, but rather than using a question word like “who” (__ma__ in Lojban), we use any word that will fit grammatically and mark it with the suffix particle __kau__. This cmavo belongs to selma'o UI, so grammatically it can appear anywhere. The simplest Lojban translation of Example 11.51 is therefore:
**Example 11.52. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u  
---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of  
ma | kau | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
X | [indirect-question] | [past] | going-to | the | store.  
  

In Example 11.52, we have chosen to use __ma__ as the word marked by __kau__. In fact, any other sumti would have done as well: __zo'e__ or __da__ or even _la djan._. Using _la djan._ would suggest that it was John who I knew had gone to the store, however:
**Example 11.53. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u  
---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of/fact-that  
la | djan. | kau | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | John | [indirect-question] | [past] | going-to | the | store.  
I know who went to the store, namely John.  
---  
I know that it was John who went to the store.  
  

Using one of the indefinite pro-sumti such as __ma__ , __zo'e__ , or __da__ does not suggest any particular value.
Why does Lojban require the __kau__ marker, rather than using __ma__ as English and Chinese and many other languages do? Because __ma__ always signals a direct question, and so
**Example 11.54. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | ma | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of | [what sumti?] | [past] | goes-to | the | store  
  

means
**Example 11.55. **
Who is it that I know goes to the store?
  

It is actually not necessary to use _le du'u_ and __kau__ at all if the indirect question involves a sumti; there is generally a paraphrase of the type:
**Example 11.56. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | pu | klama | be | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the | [past] | goer | to | the | store.  
I know something about the one who went to the store (namely, his identity).  
---  
  

because the x3 place of __djuno__ is the subject of knowledge, as opposed to the fact that is known. But when the questioned point is not a sumti, but (say) a logical connection, then there is no good alternative to __kau__ :
**Example 11.57. **
mi | ba | zgana | le | du'u | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | observe | the | predication-of/fact-that | that-named | John  
jikau | la | djordj. | cu | zvati | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[connective-indirect-question] | that-named | George |  | is-at | the | park.  
I will see whether John or George (or both) is at the park.  
---  
  

In addition, Example 11.56 is only a loose paraphrase of Example 11.52, because it is left to the listener's insight to realize that what is known about the goer-to-the-store is his identity rather than some other of his attributes.

## 13.13. Miscellaneous indicators
Some indicators do not fall neatly into the categories of attitudinal, evidential, or discursive. This section discusses the following miscellaneous indicators:
ki'a |  metalinguistic confusion  
---|---  
na'i |  metalinguistic negator  
jo'a |  metalinguistic affirmer  
li'o |  omitted text (quoted material)  
sa'a |  material inserted by editor/narrator  
xu |  true-false question  
pau |  question premarker |  |  rhetorical question  
pe'a |  figurative language |  |  literal language  
bi'u |  new information |  |  old information  
ge'e |  non-specific indicator  
The cmavo __ki'a__ is one of the most common of the miscellaneous indicators. It expresses metalinguistic confusion; i.e. confusion about what has been said, as opposed to confusion not tied to the discourse (which is __.uanai__). The confusion may be about the meaning of a word or of a grammatical construct, or about the referent of a sumti. One of the uses of English “which” corresponds to __ki'a__ :
**Example 13.90. **
mi | nelci | le | ctuca  
---|---|---|---  
I | like | the | teacher.  
.i | le | ki'a | ctuca  
---|---|---|---  
| The | which | teacher?  
Which teacher?  
---  
  

Here, the second speaker does not understand the referent of the sumti _le ctuca_ , and so echoes back the sumti with the confusion marker.
The metalinguistic negation cmavo __na'i__ and its opposite __jo'a__ are explained in full in Chapter 15. In general, __na'i__ indicates that there is something wrong with a piece of discourse: either an error, or a false underlying assumption, or something else of the sort. The discourse is invalid or inappropriate due to the marked word or construct.
Similarly, __jo'a__ marks something which looks wrong but is in fact correct. These two cmavo constitute a scale, but are kept apart for two reasons: _na'inai_ means the same as __jo'a__ , but would be too confusing as an affirmation; _jo'anai_ means the same as __na'i__ , but is too long to serve as a convenient metalinguistic negator.
The next two cmavo are used to assist in quoting texts written or spoken by others. It is often the case that we wish to quote only part of a text, or to supply additional material either by way of commentary or to make a fragmentary text grammatical. The cmavo __li'o__ serves the former function. It indicates that words were omitted from the quotation. What remains of the quotation must be grammatical, however, as __li'o__ does not serve any grammatical function. It cannot, for example, take the place of a missing selbri in a bridi, or supply the missing tail of a description sumti: _le li'o_ in isolation is not grammatical.
The cmavo __sa'a__ indicates in a quotation that the marked word or construct was not actually expressed, but is inserted for editorial, narrative, or grammatical purposes. Strictly, even a __li'o__ should appear in the form _li'osa'a_ , since the __li'o__ was not part of the original quotation. In practice, this and other forms which are already associated with metalinguistic expressions, such as __sei__ (of selma'o SEI) or __to'i__ (of selma'o TO) need not be marked except where confusion might result.
In the rare case that the quoted material already contains one or more instances of __sa'a__ , they can be changed to _sa'asa'a_.
The cmavo __xu__ marks truth questions, which are discussed in detail in Section 15.8. In general, __xu__ may be translated “Is it true that ... ?” and questions whether the attached bridi is true. When __xu__ is attached to a specific word or construct, it directs the focus of the question to that word or construct.
Lojban question words, unlike those of English, frequently do not stand at the beginning of the question. Placing the cmavo __pau__ at the beginning of a bridi helps the listener realize that the bridi is a question, like the symbol at the beginning of written Spanish questions that looks like an upside-down question mark. The listener is then warned to watch for the actual question word.
Although __pau__ is grammatical in any location (like all indicators), it is not really useful except at or near the beginning of a bridi. Its scalar opposite, __paunai__ , signals that a bridi is not really a question despite its form. This is what we call in English a rhetorical question: an example appears in the English text near the beginning of Section 13.11.
The cmavo __pe'a__ is the indicator of figurative speech, indicating that the previous word should be taken figuratively rather than literally:
**Example 13.91. **
mi | viska | le | blanu | pe'a | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | blue | [figurative] | house.  
I see the “blue” house.  
---  
  

Here the house is not blue in the sense of color, but in some other sense, whose meaning is entirely culturally dependent. The use of __pe'a__ unambiguously marks a cultural reference: __blanu__ in Example 13.91 could mean “sad” (as in English) or something completely different.
The negated form, _pe'anai_ , indicates that what has been said is to be interpreted literally, in the usual way for Lojban; natural-language intuition is to be ignored.
Alone among the cmavo of selma'o UI, __pe'a__ has a rafsi, namely _pev_. This rafsi is used in forming figurative (culturally dependent) lujvo, whose place structure need have nothing to do with the place structure of the components. Thus _risnyjelca_ (heart burn) might have a place structure like:
> x1 is the heart of x2, burning in atmosphere x3 at temperature x4
whereas _pevrisnyjelca_ , explicitly marked as figurative, might have the place structure:
> x1 is indigestion/heartburn suffered by x2
which obviously has nothing to do with the places of either __risna__ or __jelca__.
The uses of __bi'u__ and __bi'unai__ correspond to one of the uses of the English articles “the” and “a/an”. An English-speaker telling a story may begin with “I saw a man who ...”. Later in the story, the same man will be referred to with the phrase “the man”. Lojban does not use its articles in the same way: both “a man” and “the man” would be translated _le nanmu_ , since the speaker has in mind a specific man. However, the first use might be marked _le bi'u nanmu_ , to indicate that this is a new man, not mentioned before. Later uses could correspondingly be tagged _le bi'unai nanmu_.
Most of the time, the distinction between __bi'u__ and __bi'unai__ need not be made, as the listener can infer the right referent. However, if a different man were referred to still later in the story, _le bi'u nanmu_ would clearly show that this man was different from the previous one.
Finally, the indicator __ge'e__ has been discussed in Section 13.8 and Section 13.10. It is used to express an attitude which is not covered by the existing set, or to avoid expressing any attitude.
Another use for __ge'e__ is to explicitly avoid expressing one's feeling on a given scale; in this use, it functions like a member of selma'o CAI: _.iige'e_ means roughly “I'm not telling whether I'm afraid or not.”
kau |  indirect question  
---|---  
This cmavo is explained in detail in Section 11.8. It marks the word it is attached to as the focus of an indirect question:
**Example 13.92. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | dakau | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of | somebody-[indirect?] | goes | to-the | store.  
I know who goes to the store.  
---

## 2.2. Pronunciation
Detailed pronunciation and spelling rules are given in Chapter 3, but what follows will keep the reader from going too far astray while digesting this chapter.
Lojban has six recognized vowels: _a_ , _e_ , _i_ , _o_ , _u_ and _y_. The first five are roughly pronounced as “a” as in “father”, _e_ as in “let”, _i_ as in “machine”, _o_ as in “dome” and _u_ as in “flute”. _y_ is pronounced as the sound called “schwa”, that is, as the unstressed “a” as in “about” or “around”.
Twelve consonants in Lojban are pronounced more or less as their counterparts are in English: _b_ , _d_ , _f_ , _k_ , _l_ , _m_ , _n_ , _p_ , _r_ , _t_ , _v_ and _z_. The letter _c_ , on the other hand is pronounced as the “sh” in “hush”, while _j_ is its voiced counterpart, the sound of the “s” in “pleasure”. _g_ is always pronounced as it is in “gift”, never as in “giant”. _s_ is as in “sell”, never as in “rose”. The sound of _x_ is not found in English in normal words. It is found as “ch” in Scottish “loch”, as “j” in Spanish “junta”, and as „ch“ in German „Bach“; it also appears in the English interjection “yecchh!”. It gets easier to say as you practice it. The letter _r_ can be trilled, but doesn't have to be.
The Lojban diphthongs _ai_ , _ei_ , _oi_ , and _au_ are pronounced much as in the English words “sigh”, “say”, “boy”, and “how”. Other Lojban diphthongs begin with an _i_ pronounced like English “y” (for example, _io_ is pronounced “yo”) or else with a _u_ pronounced like English “w” (for example, _ua_ is pronounced “wa”).
Lojban also has three “semi-letters”: the period, the comma and the apostrophe. The period represents a glottal stop or a pause; it is a required stoppage of the flow of air in the speech stream. The apostrophe sounds just like the English letter “h”. Unlike a regular consonant, it is not found at the beginning or end of a word, nor is it found adjacent to a consonant; it is only found between two vowels. The comma has no sound associated with it, and is used to separate syllables that might ordinarily run together. It is not used in this chapter.
Stress falls on the next to the last syllable of all words, unless that vowel is _y_ , which is never stressed; in such words the third-to-last syllable is stressed. If a word only has one syllable, then that syllable is not stressed.
All Lojban words are pronounced as they are spelled: there are no silent letters.
