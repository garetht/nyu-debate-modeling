## 2.16. Indicators
Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. “Aha!”, “Oh no!”, “Ouch!”, “Aahh!”, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.
Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left. For example:
**Example 2.79. **
.ie |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Agreement! |  I |  - |  go.  
Yep! I'll go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.80. **
.ei |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Obligation! |  I |  - |  go.  
I should go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.81. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  le melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go |  to-the beautiful-thing  
.ui |  [ku]  
---|---  
and I am happy because it is the beautiful thing I'm going to |  -  
  

Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison, the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means “and”.
**Example 2.82. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  You |  - |  stay.  
  

**Example 2.83. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ji'a |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  In addition, |  you |  - |  stay. |  added weight  
  

**Example 2.84. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ku'i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  However, |  you |  - |  stay. |  contrast  
  

Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”. Evidentials show the speaker's relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include __za'a__ (I directly observe the relationship), __pe'i__ (I believe that the relationship holds), __ru'a__ (I postulate the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.
**Example 2.85. **
pe'i |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I opine! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.  
  

**Example 2.86. **
za'a |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I directly observe! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.

## 2.11. Examples of brivla
The simplest form of selbri is an individual word. A word which may by itself express a selbri relation is called a __brivla__. The three types of brivla are gismu (root words), lujvo (compounds), and fu'ivla (borrowings from other languages). All have identical grammatical uses. So far, most of our selbri have been gismu or tanru built from gismu.
gismu:
**Example 2.46. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  ti |  zo'e |  zo'e |  ta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go-er |  - |  goes |  destination |  origin |  route |  means.  
I go here (to this) using that means (from somewhere via some route).  
---  
  

lujvo:
**Example 2.47. **
ta |  [cu] |  blari'o  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  is-blue-green.  
  

fu'ivla:
**Example 2.48. **
ti |  [cu] |  djarspageti  
---|---|---  
This |  - |  is-spaghetti.  
  

Some cmavo may also serve as selbri, acting as variables that stand for another selbri. The most commonly used of these is __go'i__ , which represents the main bridi of the previous Lojban sentence, with any new sumti or other sentence features being expressed replacing the previously expressed ones. Thus, in this context:
**Example 2.49. **
ta |  [cu] |  go'i  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  too/same-as-last selbri.  
That (is spaghetti), too.  
---

## 17.12. Acronyms
An acronym is a name constructed of lerfu. English examples are “DNA”, “NATO”, “CIA”. In English, some of these are spelled out (like “DNA” and “CIA”) and others are pronounced more or less as if they were ordinary English words (like “NATO”). Some acronyms fluctuate between the two pronunciations: “SQL” may be “ess cue ell” or “sequel”.
In Lojban, a name can be almost any sequence of sounds that ends in a consonant and is followed by a pause. The easiest way to Lojbanize acronym names is to glue the lerfu words together, using _'_ wherever two vowels would come together (pauses are illegal in names) and adding a final consonant:
**Example 17.40. **
la dyny'abub. .i la ny'abuty'obub. .i la cy'ibu'abub.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulyl. .i la .ibubymym. .i la ny'ybucyc.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

There is no fixed convention for assigning the final consonant. In Example 17.40, the last consonant of the lerfu string has been replicated into final position.
Some compression can be done by leaving out __bu__ after vowel lerfu words (except for __.y.bu__ , wherein the __bu__ cannot be omitted without ambiguity). Compression is moderately important because it's hard to say long names without introducing an involuntary (and illegal) pause:
**Example 17.41. **
la dyny'am. .i la ny'aty'om. .i la cy'i'am.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulym. .i la .ibymym. .i la ny'ybucym.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

In Example 17.41, the final consonant _m_ stands for __merko__ , indicating the source culture of these acronyms.
Another approach, which some may find easier to say and which is compatible with older versions of the language that did not have a _'_ character, is to use the consonant _z_ instead of _'_ :
**Example 17.42. **
la dynyzaz. .i la nyzatyzoz. .i la cyzizaz.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulyz. .i la .ibymyz. .i la nyzybucyz.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

One more alternative to these lengthy names is to use the lerfu string itself prefixed with __me__ , the cmavo that makes sumti into selbri:
**Example 17.43. **
la | me | dy | ny. | .abu  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | what-pertains-to |  “d” |  “n” |  “a”  
  

This works because __la__ , the cmavo that normally introduces names used as sumti, may also be used before a predicate to indicate that the predicate is a (meaningful) name:
**Example 17.44. **
la | cribe | cu | ciska  
---|---|---|---  
That-named |  “Bear” |  | writes.  
Bear is a writer.  
---  
  

Example 17.44 does not of course refer to a bear (_le cribe_ or _lo cribe_) but to something else, probably a person, named “Bear”. Similarly, _me dy ny. .abu_ is a predicate which can be used as a name, producing a kind of acronym which can have pauses between the individual lerfu words.

## 14.14. Non-logical connectives
Way back in Section 14.1, the point was made that not every use of English “and”, “if ... then”, and so on represents a Lojban logical connective. In particular, consider the “and” of:
**Example 14.109. **
John and Alice carried the piano.
  

Given the nature of pianos, this probably means that John carried one end and Alice the other. So it is not true that:
**Example 14.110. **
John carried the piano, and Alice carried the piano.
  

which would mean that each of them carried the piano by himself/herself. Lojban deals with this particular linguistic phenomenon as a “mass”. John and Alice are joined together into a mass, John-and-Alice, and it is this mass which carried the piano, not either of them separately. The cmavo __joi__ (of selma'o JOI) is used to join two or more components into a mass:
**Example 14.111. **
la | djan. | joi | la | .alis. | cu | bevri | le | pipno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | massed-with | that-named | Alice |  | carry | the | piano.  
  

Example 14.111 covers the case mentioned, where John and Alice divide the labor; it also could mean that John did all the hauling and Alice did the supervising. This possibility arises because the properties of a mass are the properties of its components, which can lead to apparent contradictions: if John is small and Alice is large, then John-and-Alice is both small and large. Masses are also discussed in Section 6.3.
Grammatically, __joi__ can appear between two sumti (like an ek) or between two tanru components (like a jek). This flexibility must be paid for in the form of occasional terminators that cannot be elided:
**Example 14.112. **
le | nanmu | ku | joi | le | ninmu | [ku] | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man |  | massed-with | the | woman |  |  | go-to | the | market.  
  

The cmavo __ku__ is the elidable terminator for __le__ , which can almost always be elided, but not in this case. If the first __ku__ were elided here, Lojban's parsing rules would see _le nanmu joi_ and assume that another tanru component is to follow; since the second __le__ cannot be part of a tanru, a parsing error results. No such problem can occur with logical connectives, because an ek signals a following sumti and a jek a following tanru component unambiguously.
Single or compound cmavo involving members of selma'o JOI are called joiks, by analogy with the names for logical connectives. It is not grammatical to use joiks to connect bridi-tails.
In tanru, __joi__ has the connotation “mixed with”, as in the following example:
**Example 14.113. **
ti | blanu | joi | xunre | bolci  
---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-(blue | mixed-with | red) | ball.  
This is a blue and red ball.  
---  
  

Here the ball is neither wholly blue nor wholly red, but partly blue and partly red. Its blue/redness is a mass property. (Just how blue something has to be to count as “wholly blue” is an unsettled question, though. A _blanu zdani_ may be so even though not every part of it is blue.)
There are several other cmavo in selma'o JOI which can be used in the same grammatical constructions. Not all of them are well-defined as yet in all contexts. All have clear definitions as sumti connectives; those definitions are shown in the following table:
A __joi__ B | the mass with components A and B  
---|---  
A __ce__ B | the set with elements A and B  
A __ce'o__ B | the sequence with elements A and B in order  
A __se__ __ce'o__ B | the sequence with elements B and A in order  
A __jo'u__ B | A and B considered jointly  
A __fa'u__ B | A and B respectively  
A __se__ __fa'u__ B | B and A respectively  
A __jo'e__ B | the union of sets A and B  
A __ku'a__ B | the intersection of sets A and B  
A __pi'u__ B | the cross product of sets A and B  
A __se__ __pi'u__ B | the cross product of sets B and A  
The cmavo __se__ is grammatical before any JOI cmavo, but only useful with those that have inherent order. Here are some examples of joiks:
**Example 14.114. **
mi | cuxna | la | .alis. | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | choose | that-named | Alice | from-that-named | Frank  
ce | la | .alis. | ce | la | djeimyz.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and-member | that-named | Alice | and-member | that-named | James.  
I choose Alice from among Frank, Alice, and James.  
---  
  

The x3 place of __cuxna__ is a set from which the choice is being made. A set is an abstract object which is determined by specifying its members. Unlike those of a mass, the properties of a set are unrelated to its members' properties: the set of all rats is large (since many rats exist), but the rats themselves are small. This chapter does not attempt to explain set theory (the mathematical study of sets) in detail: explaining propositional logic is quite enough for one chapter!
In Example 14.114 we specify that set by listing the members with __ce__ joining them.
**Example 14.115. **
ti | liste | mi | ce'o | do | ce'o | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-list-of | me | and-sequence | you | and-sequence | that-named | John.  
This is a list of you, me, and John.  
---  
  

The x2 place of __liste__ is a sequence of the things which are mentioned in the list. (It is worth pointing out that _lo liste_ means a physical object such as a grocery list: a purely abstract list is _lo porsi_ , a sequence.) Here the three sumti connected by __ce'o__ are in a definite order, not just lumped together in a set or a mass.
So __joi__ , __ce__ , and __ce'o__ are parallel, in that the sumti connected are taken to be individuals, and the result is something else: a mass, a set, or a sequence respectively. The cmavo __jo'u__ serves as a fourth element in this pattern: the sumti connected are individuals, and the result is still individuals – but inseparably so. The normal Lojban way of saying that James and George are brothers is:
**Example 14.116. **
la | djeimyz. | bruna | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | is-the-brother-of | that-named | George.  
  

possibly adding a discursive element meaning “and vice versa”. However, “James and George are brothers” cannot be correctly translated as:
**Example 14.117. **
la | djeimyz. | .e | la | djordj. | bruna  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and | that-named | George | is-a-brother.  
  

since that expands to two bridi and means that James is a brother and so is George, but not necessarily of each other. If the __e__ is changed to __jo'u__ , however, the meaning of Example 14.116 is preserved:
**Example 14.118. **
la | djeimyz. | jo'u  
---|---|---  
That-named | James | in-common-with | that-named  
la | djordj. | cu | remei | bruna  
---|---|---|---|---  
George |  | are-a-twosome | type-of-brothers.  
  

The tanru _remei bruna_ is not strictly necessary in this sentence, but is used to make clear that we are not saying that James and George are both brothers of some third person not specified. Alternatively, we could turn the tanru around: the x1 place of __re__ __mei__ is a mass with two components, leading to:
**Example 14.119. **
la | djeimyz. | joi  
---|---|---  
That-named | James | massed-with  
la | djordj. | cu | bruna | remei  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George |  | are-a-brother | type-of-twosome.  
  

where __joi__ is used to create the necessary mass.
Likewise, __fa'u__ can be used to put two individuals together where order matters. Typically, there will be another __fa'u__ somewhere else in the same bridi:
**Example 14.120. **
la | djeimyz. | fa'u | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | jointly-in-order-with | that-named | George  
prami | la | meris. | fa'u | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
loves | that-named | Mary | jointly-in-order-with | that-named | Martha.  
James and George love Mary and Martha, respectively.  
---  
  

Here the information carried by the English adverb “respectively”, namely that James loves Mary and George loves Martha, is divided between the two occurrences of __fa'u__. If both uses of __fa'u__ were to be changed to __e__ , we would get:
**Example 14.121. **
la | djeimyz. | .e | la | djordj. | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and | that-named | George | love  
la | meris. | .e | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Mary | and | that-named | Martha.  
  

which can be transformed to four bridi:
**Example 14.122. **
la | djeimyz. | prami | la | meris. | .ije | la | djordj. | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | loves | that-named | Mary, | and | that-named | George | loves  
la | meris. | .ije | la | djeimyz. | prami | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Mary, | and | that-named | James | loves | that-named | Martha,  
.ije | la | djordj. | prami | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | that-named | George | loves | that-named | Martha.  
  

which represents quite a different state of affairs from Example 14.120. The meaning of Example 14.120 can also be conveyed by a termset:
**Example 14.123. **
la | djeimyz. | ce'e | la | meris. | pe'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | [plus] | that-named | Mary | [joint]  
.e | la | djordj. | ce'e | la | martas. | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | that-named | George | [plus] | that-named | Martha | loves.  
  

at the expense of re-ordering the list of names so as to make the pairs explicit. This option is not available when one of the lists is only described rather than enumerated:
**Example 14.124. **
la | djeimyz. | fa'u | la | djordj. | prami | re | mensi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and-respectively | that-named | George | love | two | sisters.  
  

which conveys that James loves one sister and George the other, though we are not able to tell which of the sisters is which.

## 9.3. Tagging places: FA
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
fa |  FA |  tags x1 place  
---|---|---  
fe |  FA |  tags x2 place  
fi |  FA |  tags x3 place  
fo |  FA |  tags x4 place  
fu |  FA |  tags x5 place  
fi'a |  FA |  place structure question  
In sentences like Example 9.1, it is easy to get lost and forget which sumti falls in which place, especially if the sumti are more complicated than simple names or descriptions. The place structure tags of selma'o FA may be used to help clarify place structures. The five cmavo __fa__ , __fe__ , __fi__ , __fo__ , and __fu__ may be inserted just before the sumti in the x1 to x5 places respectively:
**Example 9.8. **
fa | mi | cu | klama | fe | la | bastn. | fi | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x1= | I |  | go | x2= | that-named | Boston | x3= | that-named | Atlanta  
fo | le | dargu | fu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
x4= | the | road | x5= | the | car.  
I go to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.8, the tag __fu__ before _le karce_ clarifies that _le karce_ occupies the x5 place of __klama__. The use of __fu__ tells us nothing about the purpose or meaning of the x5 place; it simply says that _le karce_ occupies it.
In Example 9.8, the tags are overkill; they serve only to make Example 9.1 even longer than it is. Here is a better illustration of the use of FA tags for clarification:
**Example 9.9. **
fa | mi | klama | fe | le | zdani | be | mi | be'o | poi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x1= | I | go | x2= | (the | house | of | me) |  | which  
nurma | vau | fi | la | nu,IORK.  
---|---|---|---|---  
is-rural |  | x3= | that-named | New-York.  
  

In Example 9.9, the place structure of __klama__ is as follows:
x1 | agent |  _ _mi_ _  
---|---|---  
x2 | destination |  _le zdani be mi be'o poi nurma vau_  
x3 | origin |  _la nu,IORK._  
x4 | route | (empty)  
x5 | means | (empty)  
The __fi__ tag serves to remind the hearer that what follows is in the x3 place of __klama__ ; after listening to the complex sumti occupying the x2 place, it's easy to get lost.
Of course, once the sumti have been tagged, the order in which they are specified no longer carries the burden of distinguishing the places. Therefore, it is perfectly all right to scramble them into any order desired, and to move the selbri to anywhere in the bridi, even the beginning:
**Example 9.10. **
klama | fa | mi | fi | la | .atlantas. | fu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
go | x1= | I | x3= | that-named | Atlanta | x5= | the | car  
fe | la | bastn. | fo | le | dargu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston | x4= | the | road.  
Go I from Atlanta using the car to Boston via the road.  
---  
  

Note that no __cu__ is permitted before the selbri in Example 9.10, because __cu__ separates the selbri from any preceding sumti, and Example 9.10 has no such sumti.
**Example 9.11. **
fu | le | karce | fo | le | dargu | fi | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x5= | the | car | x4= | the | road | x3= | that-named | Atlanta  
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I  
Using the car, via the road, from Atlanta to Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.11 exhibits the reverse of the standard bridi form seen in Example 9.1 and Example 9.8, but still means exactly the same thing. If the FA tags were left out, however, producing:
**Example 9.12. **
le | karce | le | dargu | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | car | to-the | road | from-that-named | Atlanta  
la | bastn. | cu | klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
via-that-named | Boston |  | goes | using-me.  
The car goes to the road from Atlanta, with Boston as the route, using me as a means of transport.  
---  
  

the meaning would be wholly changed, and in fact nonsensical.
Tagging places with FA cmavo makes it easy not only to reorder the places but also to omit undesirable ones, without any need for __zo'e__ or special rules about the x1 place:
**Example 9.13. **
klama | fi | la | .atlantas. | fe | la | bastn.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A-goer | x3= | that-named | Atlanta | x2= | that-named | Boston  
fu | le | karce  
---|---|---  
x5= | the | car.  
A goer from Atlanta to Boston using the car.  
---  
  

Here the x1 and x4 places are empty, and so no sumti are tagged with __fa__ or __fo__ ; in addition, the x2 and x3 places appear in reverse order.
What if some sumti have FA tags and others do not? The rule is that after a FA-tagged sumti, any sumti following it occupy the places numerically succeeding it, subject to the proviso that an already-filled place is skipped:
**Example 9.14. **
klama | fa | mi | la | bastn. | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go | x1= | I | x2=that-named | Boston | x3=that-named | Atlanta  
le | dargu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---  
x4=the | road | x5=the | car.  
Go I to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.14, the __fa__ causes __mi__ to occupy the x1 place, and then the following untagged sumti occupy in order the x2 through x5 places. This is the mechanism by which Lojban allows placing the selbri first while specifying a sumti for the x1 place.
Here is a more complex (and more confusing) example:
**Example 9.15. **
mi | klama | fi | la | .atlantas. | le | dargu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go | x3= | that-named | Atlanta, | the | road  
fe | la | bastn. | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston, | the | car.  
I go from Atlanta via the road to Boston using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.15, __mi__ occupies the x1 place because it is the first sumti in the sentence (and is before the selbri). The second sumti, _la .atlantas._ , occupies the x3 place by virtue of the tag __fi__ , and _le dargu_ occupies the x4 place as a result of following _la .atlantas._. Finally, _la bastn._ occupies the x2 place because of its tag __fe__ , and _le karce_ skips over the already-occupied x3 and x4 places to land in the x5 place.
Such a convoluted use of tags should probably be avoided except when trying for a literal translation of some English (or other natural-language) sentence; the rules stated here are merely given so that some standard interpretation is possible.
It is grammatically permitted to tag more than one sumti with the same FA cmavo. The effect is that of making more than one claim:
**Example 9.16. **
[fa] | la | rik. | fa | la | djein. | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[x1=] | that-named | Rick | x1= | that-named | Jane | goes-to  
[fe] | le | skina | fe | le | zdani | fe | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[x2=] | the | movie | x2= | the | house | x2= | the | office  
  

may be taken to say that both Rick and Jane go to the movie, the house, and the office, merging six claims into one. More likely, however, it will simply confuse the listener. There are better ways, involving logical connectives (explained in Chapter 14), to say such things in Lojban. In fact, putting more than one sumti into a place is odd enough that it can only be done by explicit FA usage: this is the motivation for the proviso above, that already-occupied places are skipped. In this way, no sumti can be forced into a place already occupied unless it has an explicit FA cmavo tagging it.
The cmavo __fi'a__ also belongs to selma'o FA, and allows Lojban users to ask questions about place structures. A bridi containing __fi'a__ is a question, asking the listener to supply the appropriate other member of FA which will make the bridi a true statement:
**Example 9.17. **
fi'a | do | dunda | [fe] | le | vi | rozgu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[what-place]? | you | give | x2= | the | nearby | rose  
In what way are you involved in the giving of this rose?  
---  
Are you the giver or the receiver of this rose?  
  

In Example 9.17, the speaker uses the selbri __dunda__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _dunda_ _ x1 gives x2 to x3
The tagged sumti _fi'a do_ indicates that the speaker wishes to know whether the sumti __do__ falls in the x1 or the x3 place (the x2 place is already occupied by _le rozgu_). The listener can reply with a sentence consisting solely of a FA cmavo: __fa__ if the listener is the giver, __fi__ if he/she is the receiver.
I have inserted the tag __fe__ in brackets into Example 9.17, but it is actually not necessary, because __fi'a__ does not count as a numeric tag; therefore, _le vi rozgu_ would necessarily be in the x2 place even if no tag were present, because it immediately follows the selbri.
There is also another member of FA, namely __fai__ , which is discussed in Section 9.12.

## 10.22. Conversion of sumti tcita: JAI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
jai |  JAI |  tense conversion  
---|---|---  
fai |  FA |  indefinite place  
Conversion is the regular Lojban process of moving around the places of a place structure. The cmavo of selma'o SE serve this purpose, exchanging the first place with one of the others:
**Example 10.162. **
mi | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | go-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.163. **
le | zarci | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-gone-to | by-me.  
  

It is also possible to bring a place that is specified by a sumti tcita (for the purposes of this chapter, a tense sumti tcita) to the front, by using __jai__ plus the tense as the grammatical equivalent of SE:
**Example 10.164. **
le | ratcu | cu | citka | le | cirla | vi | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | rat |  | eats | the | cheese | [short-distance] | the | park.  
The rat eats the cheese in the park.  
---  
  

**Example 10.165. **
le | panka | cu | jai vi | citka | le | cirla | fai | le | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | park |  | is-the-place-of | eating | the | cheese | by | the | rat.  
The park is where the rat eats the cheese.  
---  
  

In Example 10.165, the construction JAI+tense converts the location sumti into the first place. The previous first place has nowhere to go, since the location sumti is not a numbered place; however, it can be inserted back into the bridi with __fai__ , the indefinite member of selma'o FA.
(The other members of FA are used to mark the first, second, etc. places of a bridi explicitly:
**Example 10.166. **
fa mi cu klama fe le zarci
  

means the same as
**Example 10.167. **
fe le zarci cu klama fa mi
  

as well as the simple
**Example 10.168. **
mi cu klama le zarci
  

in which the place structure is determined by position.)
Like SE conversion, JAI+tense conversion is especially useful in descriptions with LE selma'o:
**Example 10.169. **
mi | viska | le | jai vi | citka | be | le | cirla  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | place-of | eating |  | the | cheese.  
  

Here the eater of the cheese is elided, so no __fai__ appears.
Of course, temporal tenses are also usable with JAI:
**Example 10.170. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | jai | ca | morsi | be | fai | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the |  | [present] | is-dead |  | of | that-named |  “John” | .  
I know the time of John's death.  
---  
I know when John died.

## 2.12. The sumti _di'u_ and _la'e di'u_
In English, I might say “The dog is beautiful”, and you might reply “This pleases me.” How do you know what “this” refers to? Lojban uses different expressions to convey the possible meanings of the English:
**Example 2.50. **
le gerku |  [ku] |  cu |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
The dog is beautiful.  
---  
  

The following three sentences all might translate as “This pleases me.”
**Example 2.51. **
ti |  [cu] |  pluka |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This (the dog) pleases me.  
---  
  

**Example 2.52. **
di'u |  [cu] |  pluka |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This (the last sentence) pleases me (perhaps because it is grammatical or sounds nice).  
---  
  

**Example 2.53. **
la'e di'u |  [cu] |  pluka |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This (the meaning of the last sentence; i.e. that the dog is beautiful) pleases me.  
---  
  

Example 2.53 uses one sumti to point to or refer to another by inference. It is common to write __la'edi'u__ as a single word; it is used more often than __di'u__ by itself.

## 9.17. Complete table of BAI cmavo with rough English equivalents
The following table shows all the cmavo belonging to selma'o BAI, and has five columns. The first column is the cmavo itself; the second column is the gismu linked to it. The third column gives an English phrase which indicates the meaning of the cmavo; and the fourth column indicates its meaning when preceded by __se__.
For those cmavo with meaningful __te__ , __ve__ , and even __xe__ conversions (depending on the number of places of the underlying gismu), the meanings of these are shown on one or two extra rows following the primary row for that cmavo.
It should be emphasized that the place structures of the gismu control the meanings of the BAI cmavo. The English phrases shown here are only suggestive, and are often too broad or too narrow to correctly specify what the acceptable range of uses for the modal tag are.

## 11.4. Property abstractions
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ka |  NU |  property abstractor  
---|---|---  
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
The things described by _le nu_ descriptions (or, to put it another way, the things of which __nu__ selbri may correctly be predicated) are only moderately “abstract”. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is “the property of being blue”, or “the property of being a go-er”? They are what logicians call “intensions”. If John has a heart, then “the property of having a heart” is an abstract object which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,
**Example 11.21. **
la | djan. | cu | se risna | zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-as-heart | something-unspecified.  
John has a heart.  
---  
  

has the same truth conditions as
**Example 11.22. **
la | djan. | cu | ckaji  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-the-property  
le | ka | se risna | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | having-as-heart | something.  
John has the property of having a heart.  
---  
  

(The English word “have” frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban properties: things are said to “have” properties, but this is not the same sense of “have” as in “I have money”, which is possession.)
Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:
**Example 11.23. **
do | cnino | mi | le | ka | xunre | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-new | to-me | in-the-quality-of-the | property-of | being-red.  
You are new to me in redness.  
---  
  

(The English suffix “-ness” often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix “-ity”.)
We can also move the property description to the x1 place of Example 11.23, producing:
**Example 11.24. **
le | ka | do | xunre | [kei] | cu | cnino | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | property-of | your | being-red |  |  | is-new | to me.  
Your redness is new to me.  
---  
  

It would be suitable to use Example 11.23 and Example 11.24 to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.
There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:
**Example 11.25. **
ka | mi | prami | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | me | loving | something-unspecified  
  

is quite different from
**Example 11.26. **
ka | [zo'e] | prami | mi | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | something-unspecified | loving | me  
  

In particular, sentences like Example 11.27 and Example 11.28 are quite different in meaning:
**Example 11.27. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami  
---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X)  
I love John more than I love George.  
---  
  

**Example 11.28. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka |  | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property of | (X | loves | me).  
John loves me more than George loves me.  
---  
  

The “X” used in the glosses of Example 11.27 through Example 11.28 as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in Section 11.2. Instead, the cmavo __ce'u__ of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)
Therefore, an explicit equivalent of Example 11.27, with no ellipsis, is:
**Example 11.29. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami | ce'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X).  
  

and of Example 11.28 is:
**Example 11.30. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | ce'u | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (X | loves | me).  
  

This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:
**Example 11.31. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of |  | giving | the | horse  
  

into
**Example 11.32. **
le | ka | ce'u | dunda | le | xirma |  | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | someone-unspecified | )  
the property of being a giver of the horse  
---  
  

which is the most natural interpretation of Example 11.31, versus
**Example 11.33. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma |  | ce'u | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (someone-unspecified | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | X | )  
the property of being one to whom the horse is given  
---  
  

which is also a possible interpretation.
It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction. Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri __bridi__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _bridi_ _ x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction) among arguments (sequence/set) x3
The place structure of __ka__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> _ _ka_ _ x1 is a property of (the bridi)

## 7.11. Abstraction focus pro-sumti: _ce'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __ce'u__ is used within abstraction bridi, particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo __ka__. Abstractions, including the uses of __ce'u__ , are discussed in full in Chapter 11.
In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using __ce'u__. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly between:
**Example 7.71. **
le | ka | ce'u | gleki  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | being-happy)  
the property of being happy  
---  
happiness  
  

and
**Example 7.72. **
le | ka | gleki | ce'u  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (being-happy-about | X)  
the property of being that which someone is happy about  
---

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 10.28. List of spatial directions and direction-like relations
The following list of FAhA cmavo gives rough English glosses for the cmavo, first when used without __mo'i__ to express a direction, and then when used with __mo'i__ to express movement in the direction. When possible, the gismu from which the cmavo is derived is also listed.
ca'u |  crane |  in front (of) |  forward  
---|---|---|---  
ti'a |  trixe |  behind |  backward  
zu'a |  zunle |  on the left (of) |  leftward  
ga'u |  gapru |  above |  upward(ly)  
ni'a |  cnita |  below |  downward(ly)  
ne'i |  nenri |  within |  into  
ru'u |  sruri |  surrounding |  orbiting  
pa'o |  pagre |  transfixing |  passing through  
ne'a |  |  next to |  moving while next to   
te'e |  |  bordering |  moving along the border (of)  
re'o |  |  adjacent (to) |  along  
fa'a |  farna |  towards |  arriving at  
to'o |  |  away from |  departing from  
zo'i |  |  inward (from) |  approaching  
ze'o |  |  outward (from) |  receding from  
zo'a |  |  tangential (to) |  passing (by)  
be'a |  berti |  north (of) |  northward(ly)  
ne'u |  snanu |  south (of) |  southward(ly)  
du'a |  stuna |  east (of) |  eastward(ly)  
vu'a |  |  west (of) |  westward(ly)  
Special note on __fa'a__ , __to'o__ , __zo'i__ , and __ze'o__ :
__zo'i__ and __ze'o__ refer to direction towards or away from the speaker's location, or whatever the origin is.
__fa'a__ and __to'o__ refer to direction towards or away from some other point.

## 9.15. Logical and non-logical connection of modals
Logical and non-logical connectives are explained in detail in Chapter 14. For the purposes of this chapter, it suffices to point out that a logical (or non-logical) connection between two bridi which differ only in a modal can be reduced to a single bridi with a connective between the modals. As a result, Example 9.91 and Example 9.92 mean the same thing:
**Example 9.91. **
la | frank. | bajra | seka'a | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | runs | with-destination | the | house.  
.ije | la | frank. | bajra | teka'a | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
And | that-named | Frank | runs | with-origin | the | house.  
Frank runs to the house, and Frank runs from the house.  
---  
  

**Example 9.92. **
la | frank. | bajra | seka'a  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | runs | with-destination  
je | teka'a | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | with-origin | the | house.  
Frank runs to and from the house.  
---  
  

Neither example implies whether a single act, or two acts, of running is referred to. To compel the sentence to refer to a single act of running, you can use the form:
**Example 9.93. **
la | frank. | bajra | seka'a | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | runs | with-destination | the | house  
ce'e | teka'a | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
[joined-to] | with-origin | the | house.  
  

The cmavo __ce'e__ creates a termset containing two terms (termsets are explained in Chapter 14 and Chapter 16). When a termset contains more than one modal tag derived from a single BAI, the convention is that the two tags are derived from a common event.

## 2.17. Tenses
In English, every verb is tagged for the grammatical category called tense: past, present, or future. The sentence
**Example 2.87. **
John went to the store
  

necessarily happens at some time in the past, whereas
**Example 2.88. **
John is going to the store
  

is necessarily happening right now.
The Lojban sentence
**Example 2.89. **
la djan. |  [cu] |  klama |  le zarci  
---|---|---|---  
John |  - |  goes/went/will-go |  to-the store  
  

serves as a translation of either Example 2.87 or Example 2.88, and of many other possible English sentences as well. It is not marked for tense, and can refer to an event in the past, the present or the future. This rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of representing the time of an event. A close translation of Example 2.87 would be:
**Example 2.90. **
la djan. |  pu |  klama |  le zarci  
---|---|---|---  
John |  [past] |  goes |  to-the store  
  

where the tag __pu__ forces the sentence to refer to a time in the past. Similarly,
**Example 2.91. **
la djan. |  ca |  klama |  le zarci  
---|---|---|---  
John |  [present] |  goes |  to-the store  
  

necessarily refers to the present, because of the tag __ca__. Tags used in this way always appear at the very beginning of the selbri, just after the __cu__ , and they may make a __cu__ unnecessary, since tags cannot be absorbed into tanru. Such tags serve as an equivalent to English tenses and adverbs. In Lojban, tense information is completely optional. If unspecified, the appropriate tense is picked up from context.
Lojban also extends the notion of “tense” to refer not only to time but to space. The following example uses the tag __vu__ to specify that the event it describes happens far away from the speaker:
**Example 2.92. **
do |  vu vecnu |  zo'e  
---|---|---  
You |  yonder sell |  something-unspecified.  
  

In addition, tense tags (either for time or space) can be prefixed to the selbri of a description, producing a tensed sumti:
**Example 2.93. **
le pu bajra |  [ku] |  cu |  tavla  
---|---|---|---  
The earlier/former/past runner |  - |  - |  talked/talks.  
  

(Since Lojban tense is optional, we don't know when he or she talks.)
Tensed sumti with space tags correspond roughly to the English use of “this” or “that” as adjectives, as in the following example, which uses the tag __vi__ meaning “nearby”:
**Example 2.94. **
le vi bajra  |  [ku] |  cu |  tavla  
---|---|---|---  
The nearby runner |  - |  - |  talks.  
This runner talks.  
---  
  

Do not confuse the use of __vi__ in Example 2.94 with the cmavo __ti__ , which also means “this”, but in the sense of “this thing”.
Furthermore, a tense tag can appear both on the selbri and within a description, as in the following example (where __ba__ is the tag for future time):
**Example 2.95. **
le vi tavla  |  [ku] |  cu |  ba klama  
---|---|---|---  
The here talker |  - |  - |  [future] goes.  
The talker who is here will go.  
---  
This talker will go.
