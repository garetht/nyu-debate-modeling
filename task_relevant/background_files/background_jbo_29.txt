## 15.9. Affirmations
There is an explicit positive form for both selma'o NA (__ja'a__) and selma'o NAhE (__je'a__), each of which would supplant the corresponding negator in the grammatical position used, allowing one to assert the positive in response to a negative question or statement without confusion. Assuming the same context as in Section 15.8:
**Example 15.89. **
xu | na | go'i  
---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that | [false] | [repeat-previous]?  
  

or equivalently
**Example 15.90. **
xu | la | djan. | [cu] | na | pu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that: | that-named | John |  | [false] | previously  
klama | la | paris. | .e | la | rom.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
went-to | that-name | Paris | and | that-named | Rome.  
  

The obvious, but incorrect, positive response to this negative question is:
**Example 15.91. **
go'i  
---  
[repeat-previous]  
---  
  

A plain __go'i__ does not mean “Yes it is”; it merely abbreviates repeating the previous statement unmodified, including any negators present; and Example 15.91 actually states that it is false that John went to both Paris and Rome.
When considering:
**Example 15.92. **
na | go'i  
---|---  
[false] | [repeat-previous]  
  

as a response to a negative question like Example 15.90, Lojban designers had to choose between two equally plausible interpretations with opposite effects. Does Example 15.92 create a double negative in the sentence by adding a new __na__ to the one already there (forming a double negative and hence a positive statement), or does the __na__ replace the previous one, leaving the sentence unchanged?
It was decided that substitution, the latter alternative, is the preferable choice, since it is then clear whether we intend a positive or a negative sentence without performing any manipulations. This is the way English usually works, but not all languages work this way – Russian, Japanese, and Navajo all interpret a negative reply to a negative question as positive.
The positive assertion cmavo of selma'o NA, which is "ja'a", can also replace the __na__ in the context, giving:
**Example 15.93. **
ja'a | go'i  
---|---  
[true] | [repeat-previous]  
John did go to Paris and Rome.  
---  
  

__ja'a__ can replace __na__ in a similar manner wherever the latter is used:
**Example 15.94. **
mi | ja'a | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [true] | go-to | the | store  
I indeed go to the store.  
---  
  

__je'a__ can replace __na'e__ in exactly the same way, stating that scalar negation does not apply, and that the relation indeed holds as stated. In the absence of a negation context, it emphasizes the positive:
**Example 15.95. **
ta | je'a | melbi  
---|---|---  
that | is-indeed | beautiful.

## 8.2. Incidental relative clauses
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
noi |  NOI |  incidental relative clause introducer  
---|---|---  
There are two basic kinds of relative clauses: restrictive relative clauses introduced by __poi__ , and incidental (sometimes called simply “non-restrictive”) relative clauses introduced by __noi__. The difference between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide information that is essential to identifying the referent of the sumti to which they are attached, whereas incidental relative clauses provide additional information which is helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying the referent of the sumti. All of the examples in Section 8.1 are restrictive relative clauses: the information in the relative clause is essential to identification. (The title of this chapter, though, uses an incidental relative clause.)
Consider the following examples:
**Example 8.12. **
le | gerku | poi | blanu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which | is-blue |  | is-large.  
The dog which is blue is large.  
---  
  

**Example 8.13. **
le | gerku | noi | blanu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | incidentally-which | is-blue |  | is-large.  
The dog, which is blue, is large.  
---  
  

In Example 8.12, the information conveyed by _poi blanu_ is essential to identifying the dog in question: it restricts the possible referents from dogs in general to dogs that are blue. This is why __poi__ relative clauses are called restrictive. In Example 8.13, on the other hand, the dog which is referred to has presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative clause _noi blanu_ just provides additional information about it. (If in fact the dog hasn't been identified clearly, then the relative clause does not help identify it further.)
In English, the distinction between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is expressed in writing by surrounding incidental, but not restrictive, clauses with commas. These commas are functioning as parentheses, because incidental relative clauses are essentially parenthetical. This distinction in punctuation is represented in speech by a difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive relative clauses can be introduced by “that” as well as “which” and “who”, whereas incidental relative clauses cannot begin with “that”. Lojban, however, always uses the cmavo __poi__ and __noi__ rather than punctuation or intonation to make the distinction.
Here are more examples of incidental relative clauses:
**Example 8.14. **
mi | noi | pajni | cu | zvati  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | who-incidentally | am-a-judge |  | am-at | [some-place].  
I, a judge, am present.  
---  
  

In this example, __mi__ is already sufficiently restricted, and the additional information that I am a judge is being provided solely for the listener's edification.
**Example 8.15. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | karce | noi | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | car | incidentally-which | is-white.  
Do you see my car, which is white?  
---  
  

In Example 8.15, the speaker is presumed to have only one car, and is providing incidental information that it is white. (Alternatively, he or she might have more than one car, since _le karce_ can be plural, in which case the incidental information is that each of them is white.) Contrast Example 8.16 with a restrictive relative clause:
**Example 8.16. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | karce | poi | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | car | which | is-white.  
Do you see my car that is white?  
---  
Do you see my white car?  
  

Here the speaker probably has several cars, and is restricting the referent of the sumti _le mi karce_ (and thereby the listener's attention) to the white one only. Example 8.16 means much the same as Example 8.17, which does not use a relative clause:
**Example 8.17. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | blabi | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | white | car.  
Do you see my car, the white one?  
---  
  

So a restrictive relative clause attached to a description can often mean the same as a description involving a tanru. However, _blabi karce_ , like all tanru, is somewhat vague: in principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things, or even express some more complicated concept involving whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative clause of Example 8.16 can only refer to a car which is white, not to any more complex or extended concept.

## 11.5. Amount abstractions
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
ni |  NU |  amount abstraction  
---|---|---  
Amount abstractions are far more limited than event or property abstractions. They really make sense only if the selbri of the abstracted bridi is subject to measurement of some sort. Thus we can speak of:
**Example 11.34. **
le | ni | le | pixra | cu | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | amount-of | (the | picture |  | being-blue | )  
the amount of blueness in the picture  
---  
  

because “blueness” could be measured with a colorimeter or a similar device. However,
**Example 11.35. **
le | ni | la | djein. | cu | mamta | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | amount-of | (that-named | Jane |  | being-a-mother | )  
the amount of Jane's mother-ness (?)  
---  
the amount of mother-ness in Jane (?)  
  

makes very little sense in either Lojban or English. We simply do not have any sort of measurement scale for being a mother.
Semantically, a sumti with _le ni_ is a number; however, it cannot be treated grammatically as a quantifier in Lojban unless prefixed by the mathematical cmavo __mo'e__ :
**Example 11.36. **
li | pa | vu'u | mo'e | le | ni |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 1 | minus | the-operand | the | amount-of | (  
le | pixra | cu | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | picture |  | being-blue | )  
1 - B, where `B` = blueness of the picture  
---  
  

Mathematical Lojban is beyond the scope of this chapter, and is explained more fully in Chapter 18.
There are contexts where either property or amount abstractions make sense, and in such constructions, amount abstractions can make use of __ce'u__ just like property abstractors. Thus,
**Example 11.37. **
le | pixra | cu | cenba | le | ka | ce'u | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | picture |  | varies | in-the | property-of | (X | is blue | ).  
The picture varies in being blue.  
---  
The picture varies in blueness.  
  

is not the same as
**Example 11.38. **
le | pixra | cu | cenba | le | ni | ce'u | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | picture |  | varies | in-the | amount-of | (X | is blue | ).  
The picture varies in how blue it is.  
---  
The picture varies in blueness.  
  

Example 11.37 conveys that the blueness comes and goes, whereas Example 11.38 conveys that its quantity changes over time.
Whenever we talk of measurement of an amount, there is some sort of scale, and so the place structure of __ni__ abstraction selbri is:
> _ _ni_ _ x1 is the amount of (the bridi) on scale x2
Note: the best way to express the x2 places of abstract sumti is to use something like _le ni ... kei be_. See Example 11.62 for the use of this construction.

## 11.7. Predication/sentence abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
du'u |  NU |  predication abstraction  
---|---|---  
There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:
**Example 11.42. **
I know that Frank is a fool.
  

How's that in Lojban? Let us try:
**Example 11.43. **
mi | djuno | le | nu | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the event of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can't be contained inside one's mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; Example 11.43 comes close to claiming that Frank's being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, Example 11.43 is an instance of improperly marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in Section 11.10).
Try again:
**Example 11.44. **
mi | djuno | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Closer. Example 11.44 says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn't say that he is one, as Example 11.42 does. To catch that nuance, we must say:
**Example 11.45. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the predication that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a fool” is not a property of _le du'u_ abstraction, but of __djuno__ ; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, __djuno__ like __jei__ has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) Example 11.46 has no such implied assertion:
**Example 11.46. **
mi | kucli | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

and here __du'u__ could probably be replaced by __jei__ without much change in meaning:
**Example 11.47. **
mi | kucli | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about how true it is that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, __du'u__ has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:
> _ _du'u_ _ x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2
and _le se du'u ..._ is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:
**Example 11.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | le | se du'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses | the | (sentence-expressing-that  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes-to | the | store | )  
John says that George goes to the store.  
---  
  

Example 11.48 differs from
**Example 11.49. **
la | djan | cusku | lu  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses, | quote,  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes | to-the | store, | unquote.  
John says “George goes to the store”.  
---  
  

because Example 11.49 claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas Example 11.48 claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.
_le se du'u_ is much the same as _lu'e le du'u_ , a symbol for the predication, but _se du'u_ can be used as a selbri, whereas __lu'e__ is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See Section 6.10 for a discussion of __lu'e__.)

## 6.5. Descriptors for typical objects
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
lo'e |  LE |  the typical  
---|---|---  
le'e |  LE |  the stereotypical  
As promised in Section 6.3, Lojban has a method for discriminating between “the lion” who lives in Africa and “the Englishman” who, generally speaking, doesn't live in Africa even though some Englishmen do. The descriptor __lo'e__ means “the typical”, as in
**Example 6.26. **
lo'e | cinfo | cu | xabju | le | fi'ortu'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-typical | lion |  | dwells-in | the | African-land.  
The lion dwells in Africa.  
---  
  

What is this “typical lion”? Surely it is not any particular lion, because no lion has all of the “typical” characteristics, and (worse yet) some characteristics that all real lions have can't be viewed as typical. For example, all real lions are either male or female, but it would be bizarre to suppose that the typical lion is either one. So the typical lion has no particular sex, but does have a color (golden brown), a residence (Africa), a diet (game), and so on. Likewise we can say that
**Example 6.27. **
lo'e | glipre | cu | xabju  
---|---|---|---  
The-typical | English-person |  | dwells-in  
le | fi'ortu'a | na.e | le | gligugde  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | African-land | (Not!) and | the | English-country.  
The typical English person dwells not in Africa but in England.  
---  
  

The relationship between _lo'e cinfo_ and _lo'i cinfo_ may be explained thus: the typical lion is an imaginary lion-abstraction which best exemplifies the set of lions. There is a similar relationship between __le'e__ and __le'i__ :
**Example 6.28. **
le'e | xelso | merko | cu | gusta | ponse  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-stereotypical | Greek-type-of | American |  | is-a-restaurant-type-of | owner.  
Lots of Greek-Americans own restaurants.  
---  
  

Here we are concerned not with the actual set of Greek-Americans, but with the set of those the speaker has in mind, which is typified by one (real or imaginary) who owns a restaurant. The word “stereotypical” is often derogatory in English, but __le'e__ need not be derogatory in Lojban: it simply suggests that the example is typical in the speaker's imagination rather than in some objectively agreed-upon way. Of course, different speakers may disagree about what the features of “the typical lion” are (some would include having a short intestine, whereas others would know nothing of lions' intestines), so the distinction between _lo'e cinfo_ and _le'e cinfo_ may be very fine.
Furthermore,
**Example 6.29. **
le'e | skina | cu | se finti | ne'i | la | xali,uyd.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-stereotypical | movie |  | is-invented | in | that-named | Hollywood.  
  

is probably true to an American, but might be false (not the stereotype) to someone living in India or Russia.
Note that there is no naming equivalent of __lo'e__ and __le'e__ , because there is no need, as a rule, for a “typical George” or a “typical Smith”. People or things who share a common name do not, in general, have any other common attributes worth mentioning.

## 18.18. Using Lojban resources within mekso
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
na'u |  NAhU |  selbri to operator  
---|---|---  
ni'e |  NIhE |  selbri to operand  
mo'e |  MOhE |  sumti to operand  
te'u |  TEhU |  terminator for all three  
One of the mekso design goals requires the ability to make use of Lojban's vocabulary resources within mekso to extend the built-in cmavo for operands and operators. There are three relevant constructs: all three share the elidable terminator __te'u__ (which is also used to terminate vectors marked with __jo'i__)
The cmavo __na'u__ makes a selbri into an operator. In general, the first place of the selbri specifies the result of the operator, and the other unfilled places specify the operands:
**Example 18.124. **
li | na'u | tanjo | te'u  
---|---|---|---  
The-number | the-operator | tangent | [end-operator]  
vei | pai | fe'i | re | [ve'o] | du | li | ci'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | π | / | 2 | ) | = | the-number | infinity.  
tan(π/2) = ∞  
  

__tanjo__ is the gismu for “x1 is the tangent of x2”, and the __na'u__ here makes it into an operator which is then used in forethought
The cmavo __ni'e__ makes a selbri into an operand. The x1 place of the selbri generally represents a number, and therefore is often a __ni__ abstraction, since __ni__ abstractions represent numbers. The __ni'e__ makes that number available as a mekso operand. A common application is to make equations relating pure dimensions:
**Example 18.125. **
li | ni'e | ni | clani | [te'u]  
---|---|---|---|---  
The-number |  | quantity-of | length |   
pi'i | ni'e | ni | ganra | [te'u]  
---|---|---|---|---  
times |  | quantity-of | width |   
pi'i | ni'e | ni | condi | te'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
times |  | quantity-of | depth |   
du | li | ni'e | ni | canlu  
---|---|---|---|---  
equals | the-number |  | quantity-of | volume.  
Length × Width × Depth = Volume  
  

The cmavo __mo'e__ operates similarly to __ni'e__ , but makes a sumti (rather than a selbri) into an operand. This construction is useful in stating equations involving dimensioned numbers:
**Example 18.126. **
li | mo'e | re | ratcu | su'i | mo'e | re | ractu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number |  | two | rats | plus |  | two | rabbits  
du | li | mo'e | vo | danlu  
---|---|---|---|---  
equals | the-number |  | four | animals.  
2 rats + 2 rabbits = 4 animals.  
  

Another use is in constructing Lojbanic versions of so-called “folk quantifiers”, such as “a pride of lions”:
**Example 18.127. **
mi | viska | vei | mo'e | lo'e | lanzu | ve'o | cinfo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | ( |  | the-typical | family | )-number-of | lions.  
I see a pride of lions.  
---

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  
I'm worn out by your continuous talking.  
---  
  

**Example 13.27. **
.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  
I'm putting you to bed.  
---  
  

**Example 13.28. **
.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.  
---  
  

**Example 13.29. **
.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  
I hope I feel better tomorrow!  
---  
  

**Example 13.30. **
.au | mi | sipna  
---|---|---  
[desire] | I | sleep.  
I want to sleep.  
---  
  

**Example 13.31. **
.a'ucu'i | do | pante  
---|---|---  
[no-interest] | you | complain.  
I have no interest in your complaints.  
---  
  

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  
I feel up to dealing with you.  
---  
  

**Example 13.34. **
.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  
I should fill the car's gas tank.  
---  
  

**Example 13.35. **
.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  
---|---|---|---  
[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  
Please take care of yourself!  
---  
  

**Example 13.36. **
.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  
I suggest going to the park.  
---  
  

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  
I can't believe you thought you could fool me.  
---  
  

**Example 13.38. **
do | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  
I blame you for not coming home.  
---  
  

**Example 13.39. **
.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  
le | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  
It's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  
---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  
---

## 11.4. Property abstractions
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ka |  NU |  property abstractor  
---|---|---  
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
The things described by _le nu_ descriptions (or, to put it another way, the things of which __nu__ selbri may correctly be predicated) are only moderately “abstract”. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is “the property of being blue”, or “the property of being a go-er”? They are what logicians call “intensions”. If John has a heart, then “the property of having a heart” is an abstract object which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,
**Example 11.21. **
la | djan. | cu | se risna | zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-as-heart | something-unspecified.  
John has a heart.  
---  
  

has the same truth conditions as
**Example 11.22. **
la | djan. | cu | ckaji  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-the-property  
le | ka | se risna | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | having-as-heart | something.  
John has the property of having a heart.  
---  
  

(The English word “have” frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban properties: things are said to “have” properties, but this is not the same sense of “have” as in “I have money”, which is possession.)
Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:
**Example 11.23. **
do | cnino | mi | le | ka | xunre | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-new | to-me | in-the-quality-of-the | property-of | being-red.  
You are new to me in redness.  
---  
  

(The English suffix “-ness” often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix “-ity”.)
We can also move the property description to the x1 place of Example 11.23, producing:
**Example 11.24. **
le | ka | do | xunre | [kei] | cu | cnino | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | property-of | your | being-red |  |  | is-new | to me.  
Your redness is new to me.  
---  
  

It would be suitable to use Example 11.23 and Example 11.24 to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.
There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:
**Example 11.25. **
ka | mi | prami | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | me | loving | something-unspecified  
  

is quite different from
**Example 11.26. **
ka | [zo'e] | prami | mi | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | something-unspecified | loving | me  
  

In particular, sentences like Example 11.27 and Example 11.28 are quite different in meaning:
**Example 11.27. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami  
---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X)  
I love John more than I love George.  
---  
  

**Example 11.28. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka |  | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property of | (X | loves | me).  
John loves me more than George loves me.  
---  
  

The “X” used in the glosses of Example 11.27 through Example 11.28 as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in Section 11.2. Instead, the cmavo __ce'u__ of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)
Therefore, an explicit equivalent of Example 11.27, with no ellipsis, is:
**Example 11.29. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami | ce'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X).  
  

and of Example 11.28 is:
**Example 11.30. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | ce'u | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (X | loves | me).  
  

This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:
**Example 11.31. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of |  | giving | the | horse  
  

into
**Example 11.32. **
le | ka | ce'u | dunda | le | xirma |  | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | someone-unspecified | )  
the property of being a giver of the horse  
---  
  

which is the most natural interpretation of Example 11.31, versus
**Example 11.33. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma |  | ce'u | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (someone-unspecified | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | X | )  
the property of being one to whom the horse is given  
---  
  

which is also a possible interpretation.
It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction. Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri __bridi__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _bridi_ _ x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction) among arguments (sequence/set) x3
The place structure of __ka__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> _ _ka_ _ x1 is a property of (the bridi)

## 7.11. Abstraction focus pro-sumti: _ce'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __ce'u__ is used within abstraction bridi, particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo __ka__. Abstractions, including the uses of __ce'u__ , are discussed in full in Chapter 11.
In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using __ce'u__. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly between:
**Example 7.71. **
le | ka | ce'u | gleki  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | being-happy)  
the property of being happy  
---  
happiness  
  

and
**Example 7.72. **
le | ka | gleki | ce'u  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (being-happy-about | X)  
the property of being that which someone is happy about

## 2.12. The sumti _di'u_ and _la'e di'u_
In English, I might say “The dog is beautiful”, and you might reply “This pleases me.” How do you know what “this” refers to? Lojban uses different expressions to convey the possible meanings of the English:
**Example 2.50. **
le gerku |  [ku] |  cu |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
The dog is beautiful.  
---  
  

The following three sentences all might translate as “This pleases me.”
**Example 2.51. **
ti |  [cu] |  pluka |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This (the dog) pleases me.  
---  
  

**Example 2.52. **
di'u |  [cu] |  pluka |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This (the last sentence) pleases me (perhaps because it is grammatical or sounds nice).  
---  
  

**Example 2.53. **
la'e di'u |  [cu] |  pluka |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This (the meaning of the last sentence; i.e. that the dog is beautiful) pleases me.  
---  
  

Example 2.53 uses one sumti to point to or refer to another by inference. It is common to write __la'edi'u__ as a single word; it is used more often than __di'u__ by itself.

## 9.17. Complete table of BAI cmavo with rough English equivalents
The following table shows all the cmavo belonging to selma'o BAI, and has five columns. The first column is the cmavo itself; the second column is the gismu linked to it. The third column gives an English phrase which indicates the meaning of the cmavo; and the fourth column indicates its meaning when preceded by __se__.
For those cmavo with meaningful __te__ , __ve__ , and even __xe__ conversions (depending on the number of places of the underlying gismu), the meanings of these are shown on one or two extra rows following the primary row for that cmavo.
It should be emphasized that the place structures of the gismu control the meanings of the BAI cmavo. The English phrases shown here are only suggestive, and are often too broad or too narrow to correctly specify what the acceptable range of uses for the modal tag are.

zu'e |  zukte |  with actor |  with means to goal |  with goal |  |   
The lujvo __tamsmi__ on which __tai__ is based is derived from the tanru _tarmi simsa_ and has the place structure:
> _ _tamsmi_ _ x1 has form x2, similar in form to x3 in property/quality x4
This lujvo is employed because __tarmi__ does not have a place structure useful for the modal's purpose.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  
I'm worn out by your continuous talking.  
---  
  

**Example 13.27. **
.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  
I'm putting you to bed.  
---  
  

**Example 13.28. **
.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.  
---  
  

**Example 13.29. **
.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  
I hope I feel better tomorrow!  
---  
  

**Example 13.30. **
.au | mi | sipna  
---|---|---  
[desire] | I | sleep.  
I want to sleep.  
---  
  

**Example 13.31. **
.a'ucu'i | do | pante  
---|---|---  
[no-interest] | you | complain.  
I have no interest in your complaints.  
---  
  

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  
I feel up to dealing with you.  
---  
  

**Example 13.34. **
.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  
I should fill the car's gas tank.  
---  
  

**Example 13.35. **
.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  
---|---|---|---  
[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  
Please take care of yourself!  
---  
  

**Example 13.36. **
.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  
I suggest going to the park.  
---  
  

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  
I can't believe you thought you could fool me.  
---  
  

**Example 13.38. **
do | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  
I blame you for not coming home.  
---  
  

**Example 13.39. **
.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  
le | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  
It's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  
---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  
---

## 8.6. Relative clauses and descriptors
So far, this chapter has described the various kinds of relative clauses (including relative phrases). The list is now complete, and the rest of the chapter will be concerned with the syntax of sumti that include relative clauses. So far, all relative clauses have appeared directly after the sumti to which they are attached. This is the most common position (and originally the only one), but a variety of other placements are also possible which produce a variety of semantic effects.
There are actually three places where a relative clause can be attached to a description sumti: after the descriptor (__le__ , __lo__ , or whatever), after the embedded selbri but before the elidable terminator (which is __ku__), and after the __ku__. The relative clauses attached to descriptors that we have seen have occupied the second position. Thus Example 8.43, if written out with all elidable terminators, would appear as:
**Example 8.47. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | ku'o | ku | cu | klama | vau  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | (dog | which | (is-white | ) | ) |  | goes | .  
The dog which is white is going.  
---  
  

Here __ku'o__ is the terminator paired with __poi__ and __ku__ with __le__ , and __vau__ is the terminator of the whole bridi.
When a simple descriptor using __le__ , like _le gerku_ , has a relative clause attached, it is purely a matter of style and emphasis where the relative clause should go. Therefore, the following examples are all equivalent in meaning to Example 8.47:
**Example 8.48. **
le | poi | blabi | ku'o | gerku | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | such-that-( | it-is-white | ) | dog |  | goes.  
  

**Example 8.49. **
le | gerku | ku | poi | blabi | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | (dog | ) | which | is-white |  | goes.  
  

Example 8.47 will seem most natural to speakers of languages like English, which always puts relative clauses after the noun phrases they are attached to; Example 8.48, on the other hand, may seem more natural to Finnish or Chinese speakers, who put the relative clause first. Note that in Example 8.48, the elidable terminator __ku'o__ must appear, or the selbri of the relative clause (__blabi__) will merge with the selbri of the description (__gerku__), resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. The purpose of the form appearing in Example 8.49 will be apparent shortly.
As is explained in detail in Section 6.7, two different numbers (known as the “inner quantifier” and the “outer quantifier”) can be attached to a description. The inner quantifier specifies how many things the descriptor refers to: it appears between the descriptor and the description selbri. The outer quantifier appears before the descriptor, and specifies how many of the things referred to by the descriptor are involved in this particular bridi. In the following example,
**Example 8.50. **
re |  | le | mu | prenu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | of | the | five | persons |  | go-to | the | market.  
Two of the five people [that I have in mind] are going to the market.  
---  
  

__mu__ is the inner quantifier and __re__ is the outer quantifier. Now what is meant by attaching a relative clause to the sumti _re le mu prenu_? Suppose the relative clause is _poi ninmu_ (meaning “who are women”). Now the three possible attachment points discussed previously take on significance.
**Example 8.51. **
re |  | le | poi | ninmu | ku'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | of | the | such-that([they] | are-women | )  
mu | prenu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
five | persons |  | go-to | the | market.  
Two women out of the five persons go to the market.  
---  
  

**Example 8.52. **
re |  | le | mu | prenu | poi | ninmu | [ku] | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | of | the | (five | persons | which-( | are-women) | ) |  | go-to | the | market.  
Two of the five women go to the market.  
---  
  

**Example 8.53. **
re |  | le | mu | prenu | ku | poi | ninmu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(Two | of | the | five | persons | ) | which-( | are-women | ) | go-to | the | market.  
Two women out of the five persons go to the market.  
---  
  

As the parentheses show, Example 8.52 means that all five of the persons are women, whereas Example 8.53 means that the two who are going to the market are women. How do we remember which is which? If the relative clause comes after the explicit __ku__ , as in Example 8.53, then the sumti as a whole is qualified by the relative clause. If there is no __ku__ , or if the relative clause comes before an explicit __ku__ , then the relative clause is understood to apply to everything which the underlying selbri applies to.
What about Example 8.51? By convention, it means the same as Example 8.53, and it requires no __ku__ , but it does typically require a __ku'o__ instead. Note that the relative clause comes before the inner quantifier.
When __le__ is the descriptor being used, and the sumti has no explicit outer quantifier, then the outer quantifier is understood to be __ro__ (meaning “all”), as is explained in Section 6.7. Thus _le gerku_ is taken to mean “all of the things I refer to as dogs”, possibly all one of them. In that case, there is no difference between a relative clause after the __ku__ or before it. However, if the descriptor is __lo__ , the difference is quite important:
**Example 8.54. **
lo | prenu | ku | noi | blabi | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(Some | persons | ) | incidentally-which-( | are-white | ) | go-to | the | market.  
Some people, who are white, go to the market.  
---  
  

**Example 8.55. **
lo | prenu | noi | blabi | [ku] | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | (persons | incidentally-which | are-white | ) |  | go | to-the | market.  
Some of the people, who by the way are white, go to the market.  
---  
  

Both Example 8.54 and Example 8.55 tell us that one or more persons are going to the market. However, they make very different incidental claims. Now, what does _lo prenu noi blabi_ mean? Well, the default inner quantifier is __ro__ (meaning “all”), and the default outer quantifier is __su'o__ (meaning “at least one”). Therefore, we must first take all persons, then choose at least one of them. That one or more people will be going.
In Example 8.54, the relative clause described the sumti once the outer quantifier was applied: one or more people, who are white, are going. But in Example 8.55, the relative clause actually describes the sumti before the outer quantification is applied, so that it ends up meaning “First take all persons – by the way, they're all white”. But not all people are white, so the incidental claim being made here is false.
The safe strategy, therefore, is to always use __ku__ when attaching a __noi__ relative clause to a __lo__ descriptor. Otherwise we may end up claiming far too much.
When the descriptor is __la__ , indicating that what follows is a selbri used for naming, then the positioning of relative clauses has a different significance. A relative clause inside the __ku__ , whether before or after the selbri, is reckoned part of the name; a relative clause outside the __ku__ is not. Therefore,
**Example 8.56. **
mi | viska | la | nanmu | poi | terpa | le | ke'a | xirma | [ku]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | that-named-( | man | which | fears | the | of-IT | horse | ).  
I see Man Afraid Of His Horse.  
---  
  

says that the speaker sees a person with a particular name, who does not necessarily fear any horses, whereas
**Example 8.57. **
mi | viska | la | nanmu | ku | poi | terpa | le | ke'a | xirma.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | that-named-( | Man | ) | which | fears | the | of-IT | horse.  
I see the person named “Man” who is afraid of his horse.  
---  
  

refers to one (or more) of those named “Man”, namely the one(s) who are afraid of their horses.
Finally, so-called indefinite sumti like _re karce_ , which means almost the same as _re lo karce_ (which in turn means the same as _re lo ro karce_), can have relative clauses attached; these are taken to be of the outside-the- __ku__ variety. Here is an example:
**Example 8.58. **
mi | ponse | re | karce | [ku] | poi | xekri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | two | cars |  | which-are | black.  
  

The restrictive relative clause only affects the two cars being affected by the main bridi, not all cars that exist. It is ungrammatical to try to place a relative clause within an indefinite sumti (that is, before an explicitly expressed terminating __ku__.) Use an explicit __lo__ instead.

## 9.9. Modal selbri
Consider the example:
**Example 9.55. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban  
bai | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
with-compeller | some-act-by | that-named | Frank.  
I speak in Lojban, under compulsion by Frank.  
---  
  

Example 9.55 has two modal sumti, using the modals __bau__ and __bai__. Suppose we wanted to specify the language explicitly but be vague about who's doing the compelling. We can simplify Example 9.55 to:
**Example 9.56. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban. | bai | [ku].  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban | under-compulsion |   
  

In Example 9.56, the elidable terminator __ku__ has taken the place of the sumti which would normally follow __bai__. Alternatively, we could specify the one who compels but keep the language vague:
**Example 9.57. **
mi | tavla | bau | [ku]  
---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-some-language |   
bai | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
under-compulsion-by | some-act-by | that-named | Frank.  
  

We are also free to move the modal-plus- __ku__ around the bridi:
**Example 9.58. **
bau | [ku] | bai | ku | mi | tavla  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
In-some-language |  | under-compulsion |  | I | speak.  
  

An alternative to using __ku__ is to place the modal cmavo right before the selbri, following the __cu__ which often appears there. When a modal is present, the __cu__ is almost never necessary.
**Example 9.59. **
mi | bai | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | compelledly | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

In this use, the modal is like a tanru modifier semantically, although grammatically it is quite distinct. Example 9.59 is very similar in meaning to:
**Example 9.60. **
mi | se bapli | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | compelledly | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

The __se__ conversion is needed because _bapli tavla_ would be a “compeller type of speaker” rather than a “compelled (by someone) type of speaker”, which is what a _bai tavla_ is.
If the modal preceding a selbri is constructed using __fi'o__ , then __fe'u__ is required to prevent the main selbri and the modal selbri from colliding:
**Example 9.61. **
mi | fi'o | kanla | fe'u | viska | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | with | eye |  | see | you.  
I see you with my eye(s).  
---  
  

There are two other uses of modals. A modal can be attached to a pair of bridi-tails that have already been connected by a logical, non-logical, or modal connection (see Chapter 14 for more on logical and non-logical connections):
**Example 9.62. **
mi | bai | ke | ge | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | under-compulsion | ( | both | go | to-the | market  
gi | cadzu | le | bisli | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk | on-the | ice | ).  
Under compulsion, I both go to the market and walk on the ice.  
---  
  

Here the __bai__ is spread over both _klama le zarci_ and _cadzu le bisli_ , and the _ge ... gi_ represents the logical connection “both-and” between the two.
Similarly, a modal can be attached to multiple sentences that have been combined with __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ , which are explained in more detail in Section 19.2:
**Example 9.63. **
bai | tu'e | mi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Under-compulsion | [start] | I | go | to-the | market.  
.i | mi | cadzu | le | bisli | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| I | walk | on-the | ice | [end].  
  

means the same thing as Example 9.62.
Note: Either BAI modals or _fi'o-_ plus-selbri modals may correctly be used in any of the constructions discussed in this section.
