## 13.16. Tentative conclusion
The exact ramifications of the indicator system in actual usage are unknown. There has never been anything like it in natural language before. The system provides great potential for emotional expression and transcription, from which significant Sapir-Whorf effects can be anticipated. When communicating across cultural boundaries, where different indicators are often used for the same emotion, accidental offense can be avoided. If we ever ran into an alien race, a culturally neutral language of emotion could be vital. (A classic example, taken from the science fiction of Larry Niven, is to imagine speaking Lojban to the carnivorous warriors called Kzinti, noting that a human smile bares the teeth, and could be seen as an intent to attack.) And for communicating emotions to computers, when we cannot identify all of the signals involved in subliminal human communication (things like body language are also cultural), a system like this is needed.
We have tried to err on the side of overkill. There are distinctions possible in this system that no one may care to make in any culture. But it was deemed more neutral to overspecify and let usage decide, than to choose a limited set and constrain emotional expression. For circumstances in which even the current indicator set is not enough, it is possible using the cmavo __sei__ , explained in Section 19.12, to create metalinguistic comments that act like indicators.
We envision an evolutionary development. At this point, the system is little more than a mental toy. Many of you who read this will try playing around with various combinations of indicators, trying to figure out what emotions they express and when the expressions might be useful. You may even find an expression for which there currently is no good English word and start using it. Why not, if it helps you express your feelings?
There will be a couple dozen of these used pretty much universally – mostly just simple attitudinals with, at most, intensity markers. These are the ones that will quickly be expressed at the subconscious level. But every Lojbanist who plays with the list will bring in a couple of new words. Poets will paint emotional pictures, and people who identify with those pictures will use the words so created for their own experiences.
Just as a library of tanru is built up, so will a library of attitudes be built. Unlike the tanru, though, the emotional expressions are built on some fairly nebulous root emotions – words that cannot be defined with the precision of the gismu. The emotion words of Lojban will very quickly take on a life of their own, and the outline given here will evolve into a true system of emotions.
There are several theories as to the nature of emotion, and they change from year to year as we learn more about ourselves. Whether or not Lojban's additive/scalar emotional model is an accurate model for human emotions, it does support the linguistic needs for expressing those emotions. Researchers may learn more about the nature of human emotions by exploring the use of the system by Lojban speakers. They also may be able to use the Lojban system as a means for more clearly recording emotions.
The full list of scales and attitudes will probably not be used until someone speaks the language from birth. Until then, people will use the attitudes that are important to them. In this way, we counter cultural bias – if a culture is prone to recognizing and/or expressing certain emotions more than others, its members will use only those out of the enormous set available. If a culture hides certain emotions, its members simply won't express them.
Perhaps native Lojban speakers will be more expressively clear about their emotions than others. Perhaps they will feel some emotions more strongly than others in ways that can be correlated with the word choices; any difference from the norms of other cultures could be significant. Psychologists have devised elaborate tests for measuring attitudes and personality; this may be the easiest area in which to detect any systematic cultural effect of the type sought to confirm Sapir-Whorf, simply because we already have tools in existence to test it. Because Lojban is unique among languages in having such extensive and expressive indicators, it is likely that a Sapir-Whorf effect will occur and will be recognized.
It is unlikely that we will know the true potential of a system like this one until and unless we have children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking environment. We learn too many cultural habits in the realm of emotional communication “at our mother's knee”. Such children will have a Lojban system that has stronger reinforcement than any typical culture system. The second generation of such children, then, could be said to be the start of a true Lojbanic culture.
We shouldn't need to wait that long to detect significant effects. Emotion is so basic to our lives that even a small change or improvement in emotional communication would have immediately noticeable effects. Perhaps it will be the case that the most important contribution of our “logical language” will be in the non-logical realm of emotion!

## 7.15. lujvo based on pro-sumti
There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See Section 7.16 for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.
Thus __donta'a__ , meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted as _tavla be do_ , and would have the place structure
**Example 7.76. **
> t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
  

since `t2` (the addressee) is already known to be __do__.
On the other hand, the lujvo __donma'o__ , literally “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal pronoun”, would be interpreted as _cmavo be zo do_ , and have the place structure:
**Example 7.77. **
> c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
  

since both the `c2` place (the grammatical class) and the `c3` place (the meaning) are obvious from the context __do__.
An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the __fo'a__ series is to express lujvo which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An example would be:
**Example 7.78. **
fo'a | goi | le | kulnrsu,omi | .i | lo | fo'arselsanga  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x6 | stands-for | the | Finnish-culture | . | An | x6-song.  
  

Finally, lujvo involving __zi'o__ are also possible, and are fully discussed in Chapter 12. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for __zi'o__ as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a _se pinxe be zi'o_ , the lujvo corresponding to this is _zilrelselpinxe_ (deleting the second place of _se pinxe_). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that _zilpavypinxe_ has the same place structure as _zilrelselpinxe_ , and _lo zilpavypinxe_ , like _lo zilrelselpinxe_ , refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ , __du__ , and __bu'a__ also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for _du-_ based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.

## 2.16. Indicators
Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. “Aha!”, “Oh no!”, “Ouch!”, “Aahh!”, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.
Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left. For example:
**Example 2.79. **
.ie |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Agreement! |  I |  - |  go.  
Yep! I'll go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.80. **
.ei |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Obligation! |  I |  - |  go.  
I should go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.81. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  le melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go |  to-the beautiful-thing  
.ui |  [ku]  
---|---  
and I am happy because it is the beautiful thing I'm going to |  -  
  

Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison, the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means “and”.
**Example 2.82. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  You |  - |  stay.  
  

**Example 2.83. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ji'a |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  In addition, |  you |  - |  stay. |  added weight  
  

**Example 2.84. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ku'i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  However, |  you |  - |  stay. |  contrast  
  

Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”. Evidentials show the speaker's relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include __za'a__ (I directly observe the relationship), __pe'i__ (I believe that the relationship holds), __ru'a__ (I postulate the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.
**Example 2.85. **
pe'i |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I opine! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.  
  

**Example 2.86. **
za'a |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I directly observe! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.

## 2.11. Examples of brivla
The simplest form of selbri is an individual word. A word which may by itself express a selbri relation is called a __brivla__. The three types of brivla are gismu (root words), lujvo (compounds), and fu'ivla (borrowings from other languages). All have identical grammatical uses. So far, most of our selbri have been gismu or tanru built from gismu.
gismu:
**Example 2.46. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  ti |  zo'e |  zo'e |  ta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go-er |  - |  goes |  destination |  origin |  route |  means.  
I go here (to this) using that means (from somewhere via some route).  
---  
  

lujvo:
**Example 2.47. **
ta |  [cu] |  blari'o  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  is-blue-green.  
  

fu'ivla:
**Example 2.48. **
ti |  [cu] |  djarspageti  
---|---|---  
This |  - |  is-spaghetti.  
  

Some cmavo may also serve as selbri, acting as variables that stand for another selbri. The most commonly used of these is __go'i__ , which represents the main bridi of the previous Lojban sentence, with any new sumti or other sentence features being expressed replacing the previously expressed ones. Thus, in this context:
**Example 2.49. **
ta |  [cu] |  go'i  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  too/same-as-last selbri.  
That (is spaghetti), too.  
---

## 11.4. Property abstractions
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ka |  NU |  property abstractor  
---|---|---  
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
The things described by _le nu_ descriptions (or, to put it another way, the things of which __nu__ selbri may correctly be predicated) are only moderately “abstract”. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is “the property of being blue”, or “the property of being a go-er”? They are what logicians call “intensions”. If John has a heart, then “the property of having a heart” is an abstract object which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,
**Example 11.21. **
la | djan. | cu | se risna | zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-as-heart | something-unspecified.  
John has a heart.  
---  
  

has the same truth conditions as
**Example 11.22. **
la | djan. | cu | ckaji  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-the-property  
le | ka | se risna | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | having-as-heart | something.  
John has the property of having a heart.  
---  
  

(The English word “have” frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban properties: things are said to “have” properties, but this is not the same sense of “have” as in “I have money”, which is possession.)
Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:
**Example 11.23. **
do | cnino | mi | le | ka | xunre | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-new | to-me | in-the-quality-of-the | property-of | being-red.  
You are new to me in redness.  
---  
  

(The English suffix “-ness” often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix “-ity”.)
We can also move the property description to the x1 place of Example 11.23, producing:
**Example 11.24. **
le | ka | do | xunre | [kei] | cu | cnino | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | property-of | your | being-red |  |  | is-new | to me.  
Your redness is new to me.  
---  
  

It would be suitable to use Example 11.23 and Example 11.24 to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.
There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:
**Example 11.25. **
ka | mi | prami | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | me | loving | something-unspecified  
  

is quite different from
**Example 11.26. **
ka | [zo'e] | prami | mi | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | something-unspecified | loving | me  
  

In particular, sentences like Example 11.27 and Example 11.28 are quite different in meaning:
**Example 11.27. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami  
---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X)  
I love John more than I love George.  
---  
  

**Example 11.28. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka |  | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property of | (X | loves | me).  
John loves me more than George loves me.  
---  
  

The “X” used in the glosses of Example 11.27 through Example 11.28 as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in Section 11.2. Instead, the cmavo __ce'u__ of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)
Therefore, an explicit equivalent of Example 11.27, with no ellipsis, is:
**Example 11.29. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami | ce'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X).  
  

and of Example 11.28 is:
**Example 11.30. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | ce'u | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (X | loves | me).  
  

This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:
**Example 11.31. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of |  | giving | the | horse  
  

into
**Example 11.32. **
le | ka | ce'u | dunda | le | xirma |  | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | someone-unspecified | )  
the property of being a giver of the horse  
---  
  

which is the most natural interpretation of Example 11.31, versus
**Example 11.33. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma |  | ce'u | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (someone-unspecified | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | X | )  
the property of being one to whom the horse is given  
---  
  

which is also a possible interpretation.
It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction. Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri __bridi__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _bridi_ _ x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction) among arguments (sequence/set) x3
The place structure of __ka__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> _ _ka_ _ x1 is a property of (the bridi)

## 7.11. Abstraction focus pro-sumti: _ce'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __ce'u__ is used within abstraction bridi, particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo __ka__. Abstractions, including the uses of __ce'u__ , are discussed in full in Chapter 11.
In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using __ce'u__. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly between:
**Example 7.71. **
le | ka | ce'u | gleki  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | being-happy)  
the property of being happy  
---  
happiness  
  

and
**Example 7.72. **
le | ka | gleki | ce'u  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (being-happy-about | X)  
the property of being that which someone is happy about

## 18.9. Approximation and inexact numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ji'i |  PA |  approximately  
---|---|---  
su'e |  PA |  at most  
su'o |  PA |  at least  
me'i |  PA |  less than  
za'u |  PA |  more than  
The cmavo __ji'i__ (of selma'o PA) is used in several ways to indicate approximate or rounded numbers. If it appears at the beginning of a number, the whole number is approximate:
**Example 18.60. **
ji'i | vo | no  
---|---|---  
approximation | four | zero  
approximately 40  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears in the middle of a number, all the digits following it are approximate:
**Example 18.61. **
vo | no | ji'i | mu | no  
---|---|---|---|---  
four | zero | approximation | five | zero  
roughly 4050 (where the “four thousand” is exact, but the “fifty” is approximate)  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears at the end of a number, it indicates that the number has been rounded. In addition, it can then be followed by a sign cmavo (__ma'u__ or __ni'u__), which indicate truncation towards positive or negative infinity respectively.
**Example 18.62. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation  
2.72 (rounded)  
---  
  

**Example 18.63. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i | ma'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation | positive-sign  
2.72 (rounded up)  
---  
  

**Example 18.64. **
re | pi | ze | pa | ji'i | ni'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | one | approximation | negative-sign  
2.71 (rounded down)  
---  
  

Example 18.62 through Example 18.64 are all approximations to __te'o__ (exponential e). __ji'i__ can also appear by itself, in which case it means “approximately the typical value in this context”.
The four cmavo __su'e__ , __su'o__ , __me'i__ , and __za'u__ , also of selma'o PA, express inexact numbers with upper or lower bounds:
**Example 18.65. **
mi | catlu | su'e | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-most | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.66. **
mi | catlu | su'o | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.67. **
mi | catlu | me'i | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | less-than | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.68. **
mi | catlu | za'u | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | more-than | two | persons  
  

Each of these is a subtly different claim: Example 18.66 is true of two or any greater number, whereas Example 18.68 requires three persons or more. Likewise, Example 18.65 refers to zero, one, or two; Example 18.67 to zero or one. (Of course, when the context allows numbers other than non-negative integers, _me'i re_ can be any number less than 2, and likewise with the other cases.) The exact quantifier, “exactly 2, neither more nor less” is just __re__. Note that _su'ore_ is the exact Lojban equivalent of English plurals.
If no number follows one of these cmavo, __pa__ is understood: therefore,
**Example 18.69. **
mi | catlu | su'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least-[one] | person  
  

is a meaningful claim.
Like the numbers in Section 18.8, all of these cmavo may be preceded by __pi__ to make the corresponding quantifiers for part of a whole. For example, __pisu'o__ means “at least some part of”. The quantifiers __ro__ , __su'o__ , __piro__ , and __pisu'o__ are particularly important in Lojban, as they are implicitly used in the descriptions introduced by the cmavo of selma'o LA and LE, as explained in Section 6.7. Descriptions in general are outside the scope of this chapter.

## 6.6. Quantified sumti
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ro |  PA |  all of/each of  
---|---|---  
su'o |  PA |  at least (one of)  
Quantifiers tell us how many: in the case of quantifiers with sumti, how many things we are talking about. In Lojban, quantifiers are expressed by numbers and mathematical expressions: a large topic discussed in some detail in Chapter 18. For the purposes of this chapter, a simplified treatment will suffice. Our examples will employ either the simple Lojban numbers __pa__ , __re__ , __ci__ , __vo__ , and __mu__ , meaning “one”, “two”, “three”, “four”, “five” respectively, or else one of four special quantifiers, two of which are discussed in this section and listed above. These four quantifiers are important because every Lojban sumti has either one or two of them implicitly present in it – which one or two depends on the particular kind of sumti. There is more explanation of implicit quantifiers later in this section. (The other two quantifiers, __piro__ and __pisu'o__ , are explained in Section 6.7.)
Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit quantifier. The purpose of this quantifier is to specify how many of the things referred to by the sumti are being talked about. Here are some simple examples contrasting sumti with and without explicit quantifiers:
**Example 6.30. **
do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---  
You | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

**Example 6.31. **
re | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
Two-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

The difference between Example 6.30 and Example 6.31 is the presence of the explicit quantifier __re__ in the latter example. Although __re__ by itself means “two”, when used as a quantifier it means “two-of”. Out of the group of listeners (the number of which isn't stated), two (we are not told which ones) are asserted to be “walkers on the ice”. Implicitly, the others (if any) are not walkers on the ice. In Lojban, you cannot say “I own three shoes” if in fact you own four shoes. Numbers need never be specified, but if they are specified they must be correct.
(This rule does not mean that there is no way to specify a number which is vague. The sentence
**Example 6.32. **
mi | ponse | su'o | ci | cutci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | at-least | three | shoes.  
  

is true if you own three shoes, or four, or indeed any larger number. More details on vague numbers appear in the discussion of mathematical expressions in Chapter 18.)
Now consider Example 6.30 again. How many of the listeners are claimed to walk on the ice? The answer turns out to be: all of them, however many that is. So Example 6.30 and Example 6.33:
**Example 6.33. **
ro | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
All-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

turn out to mean exactly the same thing. This is a safe strategy, because if one of my listeners doesn't turn out to be walking on the ice, I can safely claim that I didn't intend that person to be a listener! And in fact, all of the personal pro-sumti such as __mi__ and __mi'o__ and __ko__ obey the same rule. We say that personal pro-sumti have a so-called “implicit quantifier” of __ro__ (all). This just means that if no quantifier is given explicitly, the meaning is the same as if the implicit quantifier had been used.
Not all sumti have __ro__ as the implicit quantifier, however. Consider the quotation in:
**Example 6.34. **
mi | cusku | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say, “You walk on the ice.”  
---  
  

What is the implicit quantifier of the quotation _lu do cadzu le bisli li'u_? Surely not __ro__. If __ro__ were supplied explicitly, thus:
**Example 6.35. **
mi | cusku | ro | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | all-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

the meaning would be something like “I say every occurrence of the sentence 'You walk on the ice'”. Of course I don't say every occurrence of it, only some occurrences. One might suppose that Example 6.34 means that I express exactly one occurrence, but it is more Lojbanic to leave the number unspecified, as with other sumti. We can say definitely, however, that I say it at least once.
The Lojban cmavo meaning “at least” is __su'o__ , and if no ordinary number follows, __su'o__ means “at least once”. (See Example 6.32 for the use of __su'o__ with an ordinary number). Therefore, the explicitly quantified version of Example 6.34 is
**Example 6.36. **
mi | cusku | su'o | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | at-least-one-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say one or more instances of “You walk on the ice”.  
---  
I say “You walk on the ice”.  
  

If an explicit ordinary number such as __re__ were to appear, it would have to convey an exact expression, so
**Example 6.37. **
mi | cusku | re | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | two-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

means that I say the sentence exactly twice, neither more nor less.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 4.12. The lujvo scoring algorithm
This algorithm was devised by Bob and Nora LeChevalier in 1989. It is not the only possible algorithm, but it usually gives a choice that people find preferable. The algorithm may be changed in the future. The lowest-scoring variant will usually be the dictionary form of the lujvo. (In previous versions, it was the highest-scoring variant.)
  1. Count the total number of letters, including hyphens and apostrophes; call it `L`.
  2. Count the number of apostrophes; call it `A`.
  3. Count the number of _y-_ , _r-_ , and n-hyphens; call it `H`.
  4. For each rafsi, find the value in the following table. Sum this value over all rafsi; call it `R`: 
CVC/CV (final) | (_-sarji_) | 1  
---|---|---  
CVC/C | (_-sarj-_) | 2  
CCVCV (final) | (_-zbasu_) | 3  
CCVC | (_-zbas-_) | 4  
CVC | (_-nun-_) | 5  
CVV with an apostrophe | (_-ta'u-_) | 6  
CCV | (_-zba-_) | 7  
CVV with no apostrophe | (_-sai-_) | 8  
  5. Count the number of vowels, not including _y_ ; call it `V`.


The score is then: 
(1000 * L) - (500 * A) + (100 * H) - (10 * R) - V
In case of ties, there is no preference. This should be rare. Note that the algorithm essentially encodes a hierarchy of priorities: short words are preferred (counting apostrophes as half a letter), then words with fewer hyphens, words with more pleasing rafsi (this judgment is subjective), and finally words with more vowels are chosen. Each decision principle is applied in turn if the ones before it have failed to choose; it is possible that a lower-ranked principle might dominate a higher-ranked one if it is ten times better than the alternative.
Here are some lujvo with their scores (not necessarily the lowest scoring forms for these lujvo, nor even necessarily sensible lujvo):
**Example 4.71. **
zbasai  
---  
_zba + sai_  
(1000 * 6) - (500 * 0) + (100 * 0) - (10 * 15) - 3 = 5847  
  

**Example 4.72. **
nunynau  
---  
_nun + y + nau_  
(1000 * 7) - (500 * 0) + (100 * 1) - (10 * 13) - 3 = 6967  
  

**Example 4.73. **
sairzbata'u  
---  
_sai + r + zba + ta'u_  
(1000 * 11) - (500 * 1) + (100 * 1) - (10 * 21) - 5 = 10385  
  

**Example 4.74. **
zbazbasysarji  
---  
_zba + zbas + y + sarji_  
(1000 * 13) - (500 * 0) + (100 * 1) - (10 * 12) - 4 = 12976

## 10.15. Tenses in subordinate bridi
English has a set of rules, formally known as “sequence of tense rules”, for determining what tense should be used in a subordinate clause, depending on the tense used in the main sentence. Here are some examples:
**Example 10.100. **
John says that George is going to the market.
  

**Example 10.101. **
John says that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.102. **
John said that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.103. **
John said that George had gone to the market.
  

In Example 10.100 and Example 10.101, the tense of the main sentence is the present: “says”. If George goes when John speaks, we get the present tense “is going” (“goes” would be unidiomatic); if George goes before John speaks, we get the past tense “went”. But if the tense of the main sentence is the past, with “said”, then the tense required in the subordinate clause is different. If George goes when John speaks, we get the past tense “went”; if George goes before John speaks, we get the past-perfect tense “had gone”.
The rule of English, therefore, is that both the tense of the main sentence and the tense of the subordinate clause are understood relative to the speaker of the main sentence (not John, but the person who speaks Example 10.100 through Example 10.103).
Lojban, like Russian and Esperanto, uses a different convention. A tense in a subordinate bridi is understood to be relative to the tense already set in the main bridi. Thus Example 10.100 through Example 10.103 can be expressed in Lojban respectively thus:
**Example 10.104. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.105. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.106. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.107. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

Probably the most counterintuitive of the Lojban examples is Example 10.106. The __ca__ looks quite odd, as if George were going to the market right now, rather than back when John spoke. But this __ca__ is really a __ca__ with respect to a reference point specified by the outer __pu__. This behavior is the same as the additive behavior of multiple tenses in the same bridi, as explained in Section 10.13.
There is a special cmavo __nau__ (of selma'o CUhE) which can be used to override these rules and get to the speaker's current reference point. (Yes, it sounds like English “now”.) It is not grammatical to combine __nau__ with any other cmavo in a tense, except by way of a logical or non-logical connection (see Section 10.20). Here is a convoluted sentence with several nested bridi which uses __nau__ at the lowest level:
**Example 10.108. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | .alis | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | maris. | nau | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Mary | [now] | goes-to | the | market.  
John said that Alice had said that George had earlier said that Mary is now going to the market.  
---  
  

The use of __nau__ does not affect sticky tenses.

## 14.9. Compound bridi
So far we have seen how to handle two sentences that need have no similarity at all (bridi connection) and sentences that are identical except for a difference in one sumti (sumti connection). It would seem natural to ask how to logically connect sentences that are identical except for having different selbri.
Surprise! Lojban provides no logical connective that is designed to handle selbri and nothing else. Instead, selbri connection is provided as part of a more general-purpose mechanism called “compound bridi”. Compound bridi result from logically connecting sentences that differ in their selbri and possibly some of their sumti.
The simplest cases result when the x1 sumti is the only common point:
**Example 14.49. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | .ije | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market, | and | I | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to the compound bridi:
**Example 14.50. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

As Example 14.50 indicates, giheks are used in afterthought to create compound bridi; __gi'e__ is the gihek corresponding to “and”. The actual phrases _klama le zarci_ and _nelci la djan._ that the gihek connects are known as “bridi-tails”, because they represent (in this use) the “tail end” of a bridi, including the selbri and any following sumti, but excluding any sumti that precede the selbri:
**Example 14.51. **
mi | ricfu | gi'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-rich | and | go-to | the | market.  
  

In Example 14.51, the first bridi-tail is __ricfu__ , a simple selbri, and the second bridi-tail is _klama le zarci_ , a selbri with one following sumti.
Suppose that more than a single sumti is identical between the two sentences:
**Example 14.52. **
mi | dunda | le | cukta | do | .ije | mi | lebna | lo | rupnu | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | give | the | book | to-you, | and | I | take | some | currency-units | from-you.  
  

In Example 14.52, the first and last sumti of each bridi are identical; the selbri and the second sumti are different. By moving the final sumti to the beginning, a form analogous to Example 14.50 can be achieved:
**Example 14.53. **
fi | do | fa | mi | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
to/from | you |  | I | give | the | book  
gi'e | lebna | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---  
and | take | some | currency-units.  
  

where the __fi__ does not have an exact English translation because it merely places __do__ in the third place of both __lebna__ and __dunda__. However, a form that preserves natural sumti order also exists in Lojban. Giheks connect two bridi-tails, but also allow sumti to be added following the bridi-tail. These sumti are known as tail-terms, and apply to both bridi. The straightforward gihek version of Example 14.52 therefore is:
**Example 14.54. **
mi | dunda | le | cukta | gi'e | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | (give | the | book) | and | (take | some | currency-units) |  | to/from-you.  
  

The __vau__ (of selma'o VAU) serves to separate the bridi-tail from the tail-terms. Every bridi-tail is terminated by an elidable __vau__ , but only in connection with compound bridi is it ever necessary to express this __vau__. Thus:
**Example 14.55. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | [vau]  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market.  
  

has a single elided __vau__ , and Example 14.50 is equivalent to:
**Example 14.56. **
mi klama le zarci [vau] gi'e nelci la djan. [vau] [vau]
  

where the double __vau__ at the end of Example 14.56 terminates both the right-hand bridi-tail and the unexpressed tail-terms.
A final use of giheks is to combine bridi-tails used as complete sentences, the Lojban observative:
**Example 14.57. **
klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Since x1 is omitted in both of the bridi underlying Example 14.57, this compound bridi does not necessarily imply that the goer and the walker are the same. Only the presence of an explicit x1 (other than __zo'e__ , which is equivalent to omission) can force the goer and the walker to be identical.
A strong argument for this convention is provided by analysis of the following example:
**Example 14.58. **
klama | la | nu,IORK.  
---|---|---  
A-goer | to-that-named | New-York  
la | finyks.  
---|---  
from-that-named | Phoenix  
gi'e | klama | la | nu,IORK.  
---|---|---|---  
and | a-goer | to-that-named | New-York  
la | rom.  
---|---  
from-that-named | Rome.  
  

If the rule were that the x1 places of the two underlying bridi were considered identical, then (since there is nothing special about x1), the unspecified x4 (route) and x5 (means) places would also have to be the same, leading to the absurd result that the route from Phoenix to New York is the same as the route from Rome to New York. Inserting __da__ , meaning roughly “something”, into the x1 place cures the problem:
**Example 14.59. **
da | klama | la | nu,IORK. | la | finyks.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Something | is-a-goer | to-that-named | New-York | from-that-named | Phoenix  
gi'e | klama | la | nu,IORK. | la | rom.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | is-a-goer | to-that-named | New-York | from-that-named | Rome.  
  

The syntax of giheks is:
> [na] [se] GIhA [nai] 
which is exactly parallel to the syntax of eks.

## 16.8. The problem of “any”
Consider the English sentence 
**Example 16.47. **
Anyone who goes to the store, walks across the field.
  

Using the facilities already discussed, a plausible translation might be
**Example 16.48. **
ro | da | poi | klama | le | zarci | cu | cadzu | le | foldi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | X | such-that-it | goes-to | the | store |  | walks-on | the | field.  
Everyone who goes to the store walks across the field.  
---  
  

But there is a subtle difference between Example 16.47 and Example 16.48. Example 16.48 tells us that, in fact, there are people who go to the store, and that they walk across the field. A sumti of the type _ro da poi klama_ requires that there are things which __klama__ : Lojban universal claims always imply the corresponding existential claims as well. Example 16.47, on the other hand, does not require that there are any people who go to the store: it simply states, conditionally, that if there is anyone who goes to the store, he or she walks across the field as well. This conditional form mirrors the true Lojban translation of Example 16.47:
**Example 16.49. **
ro | da | zo'u | da | go | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-every | X | : | X | if-and-only-if | it-is-a-goer-to | the | store  
gi | cadzu | le | foldi  
---|---|---|---  
| is-a-walker-on | the | field.  
  

Although Example 16.49 is a universal claim as well, its universality only implies that there are objects of some sort or another in the universe of discourse. Because the claim is conditional, nothing is implied about the existence of goers-to-the-store or of walkers-on-the-field, merely that any entity which is one is also the other.
There is another use of “any” in English that is not universal but existential. Consider
**Example 16.50. **
I need any box that is bigger than this one.
  

Example 16.50 does not at all mean that I need every box bigger than this one, for indeed I do not; I require only one box. But the naive translation
**Example 16.51. **
mi | nitcu | da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | some-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-one  
  

does not work either, because it asserts that there really is such a box, as the prenex paraphrase demonstrates:
**Example 16.52. **
da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti | zo'u | mi | nitcu | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this | : | I | need | X.  
  

What to do? Well, the x2 place of __nitcu__ can be filled with an event as well as an object, and in fact Example 16.51 can also be paraphrased as:
**Example 16.53. **
mi | nitcu | lo | nu | mi | ponse | lo | tanxe  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | an | event-of | I | possess | some | box(es)  
poi | bramau | ti  
---|---|---  
which-are | bigger-than | this-one.  
  

Rewritten using variables, Example 16.53 becomes
**Example 16.54. **
mi | nitcu | lo | nu | da | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | an | event-of | there-being-an-X | such-that:  
da | se | ponse | mi  
---|---|---|---  
X |  | is-possessed-by | me  
gi'e | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-thing.  
  

So we see that a prenex can be attached to a bridi that is within a sentence. By default, a variable always behaves as if it is bound in the prenex which (notionally) is attached to the smallest enclosing bridi, and its scope does not extend beyond that bridi. However, the variable may be placed in an outer prenex explicitly:
**Example 16.55. **
da | poi | tanxe | gi'e | bramau | ti | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
There-is-an-X | which | is-a-box | and | is-bigger-than | this-one | such-that:  
mi | nitcu | le | nu | mi | ponse | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | need | the | event-of | my | possessing | X.  
  

But what are the implications of Example 16.53 and Example 16.55? The main difference is that in Example 16.55, the __da__ is said to exist in the real world of the outer bridi; but in Example 16.53, the existence is only within the inner bridi, which is a mere event that need not necessarily come to pass. So Example 16.55 means
**Example 16.56. **
There's a box, bigger than this one, that I need
  

which is what Example 16.52 says, whereas Example 16.53 turns out to be an effective translation of our original Example 16.47. So uses of “any” that aren't universal end up being reflected by variables bound in the prenex of a subordinate bridi.

## 7.7. Indefinite pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the zo'e-series and the co'e-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
zo'e |  KOhA |  zo'e-series |  the obvious value  
---|---|---|---  
zu'i |  KOhA |  zo'e-series |  the typical value  
zi'o |  KOhA |  zo'e-series |  the nonexistent value  
co'e |  GOhA |  co'e-series |  has the obvious relationship  
The cmavo of the zo'e-series represent indefinite, unspecified sumti. The cmavo __zo'e__ represents an elliptical value for this sumti place; it is the optional spoken place holder when a sumti is skipped without being specified. Note that the elliptical value is not always the typical value. The properties of ellipsis lead to an elliptical sumti being defined as “whatever I want it to mean but haven't bothered to figure out, or figure out how to express”.
The cmavo __zu'i__ , on the other hand, represents the typical value for this place of this bridi:
**Example 7.49. **
mi | klama | le | bartu | be | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | outside | of | the | house | from  
le | nenri | be | le | zdani | zu'i | zu'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | inside | of | the | house | [by-typical-route] | [by-typical-means]  
  

In Example 7.49, the first __zu'i__ probably means something like “by the door”, and the second __zu'i__ probably means something like “on foot”, those being the typical route and means for leaving a house. On the other hand, if you are at the top of a high rise during a fire, neither __zu'i__ is appropriate. It's also common to use __zu'i__ in “by standard” places.
Finally, the cmavo __zi'o__ represents a value which does not even exist. When a bridi fills one of its places with __zi'o__ , what is really meant is that the selbri has a place which is irrelevant to the true relationship the speaker wishes to express. For example, the place structure of __zbasu__ is:
> actor x1 makes x2 from materials x3
Consider the sentence
> Living things are made from cells.
This cannot be correctly expressed as:
**Example 7.50. **
loi | jmive | cu | se zbasu | [zo'e] | fi | loi | selci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-mass-of | living-things |  | is-made | [by-something] | from | the-mass-of | cells  
  

because the __zo'e__ , expressed or understood, in Example 7.50 indicates that there is still a “maker” in this relationship. We do not generally suppose, however, that someone “makes” living things from cells. The best answer is probably to find a different selbri, one which does not imply a “maker”: however, an alternative strategy is to use __zi'o__ to eliminate the maker place:
**Example 7.51. **
loi | jmive | cu  
---|---|---  
The-mass-of | living-things |   
se zbasu | zi'o |  | loi | selci  
---|---|---|---|---  
is-made | [without-maker] | from | the-mass-of | cells.  
  

Note: The use of __zi'o__ to block up, as it were, one place of a selbri actually creates a new selbri with a different place structure. Consider the following examples:
**Example 7.52. **
mi | zbasu | le | dinju |  | loi | mudri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | make | the | building | from | some-of-the-mass-of | wood.  
I make the building out of wood.  
---  
  

**Example 7.53. **
zi'o | zbasu | le | dinju |  | loi | mudri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[without-maker] | makes | the | building | from | some-of-the-mass-of | wood.  
The building is made out of wood.  
---  
  

**Example 7.54. **
mi | zbasu | zi'o |  | loi | mudri  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | make | [without-thing-made] | from | some-of-the-mass-of | wood.  
I build using wood.  
---  
  

**Example 7.55. **
mi | zbasu | le | dinju | zi'o  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | make | the | building | [without-material].  
I make the building.  
---  
  

If Example 7.52 is true, then Example 7.53 through Example 7.55 must be true also. However, Example 7.51 does not correspond to any sentence with three regular (non- __zi'o__) sumti.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ (which by itself constitutes the co'e-series of selma'o GOhA) represents the elliptical selbri. Lojban grammar does not allow the speaker to merely omit a selbri from a bridi, although any or all sumti may be freely omitted. Being vague about a relationship requires the use of __co'e__ as a selbri place-holder:
**Example 7.56. **
mi | troci | le | nu | mi | co'e | le | vorme  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | try | the | event-of | my | [doing-the-obvious-action] | to-the | door.  
I try the door.  
---  
  

The English version means, and the Lojban version probably means, that I try to open the door, but the relationship of opening is not actually specified; the Lojbanic listener must guess it from context. Lojban, unlike English, makes it clear that there is an implicit action that is not being expressed.
The form of __co'e__ was chosen to resemble __zo'e__ ; the cmavo __do'e__ of selma'o BAI (see Section 9.6) also belongs to the same group of cmavo.
Note that __do'i__ , of the di'u-series, is also a kind of indefinite pro-sumti: it is indefinite in referent, but is restricted to referring only to an utterance.

## 11.2. Event abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
nu |  NU |  event abstractor  
---|---|---  
The examples in Section 11.1 made use of __nu__ as the abstractor, and it is certainly the most common abstractor in Lojban text. Its purpose is to capture the event or state of the bridi considered as a whole. Do not confuse the __le__ description built on a __nu__ abstraction with ordinary descriptions based on __le__ alone. The following sumti are quite distinct:
**Example 11.5. **
le | klama  
---|---  
the comer, that which comes  
---  
  

**Example 11.6. **
le | se | klama  
---|---|---  
the destination  
---  
  

**Example 11.7. **
le | te | klama  
---|---|---  
the origin  
---  
  

**Example 11.8. **
le | ve | klama  
---|---|---  
the route  
---  
  

**Example 11.9. **
le | xe | klama  
---|---|---  
the means of transportation  
---  
  

**Example 11.10. **
le | nu | klama  
---|---|---  
the event of someone coming to somewhere from somewhere by some route using some means  
---  
  

Example 11.5 through Example 11.9 are descriptions that isolate the five individual sumti places of the selbri __klama__. Example 11.10 describes something associated with the bridi as a whole: the event of it.
In Lojban, the term “event” is divorced from its ordinary English sense of something that happens over a short period of time. The description:
**Example 11.11. **
le | nu | mi | vasxu  
---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | my | breathing  
  

is an event which lasts for the whole of my life (under normal circumstances). On the other hand,
**Example 11.12. **
le | nu | la | djan. | cinba | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | that-named | John | kissing | that-named | Jane  
  

is relatively brief by comparison (again, under normal circumstances).
We can see from Example 11.10 through Example 11.12 that ellipsis of sumti is valid in the bridi of abstraction selbri, just as in the main bridi of a sentence. Any sumti may be ellipsized if the listener will be able to figure out from context what the proper value of it is, or else to recognize that the proper value is unimportant. It is extremely common for __nu__ abstractions in descriptions to have the x1 place ellipsized:
**Example 11.13. **
mi | nelci | le | nu | limna  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | the | event-of | swimming.  
I like swimming.  
---  
  

is elliptical, and most probably means:
**Example 11.14. **
mi | nelci | le | nu | mi | limna  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | the | event-of | I | swim.  
  

In the proper context, of course, Example 11.13 could refer to the event of somebody else swimming. Its English equivalent, “I like swimming”, can't be interpreted as “I like Frank's swimming”; this is a fundamental distinction between English and Lojban. In Lojban, an omitted sumti can mean whatever the context indicates that it should mean.
Note that the lack of an explicit NU cmavo in a sumti can sometimes hide an implicit abstraction. In the context of Example 11.14, the appearance of _le se nelci_ (“that which is liked”) is in effect an abstraction:
**Example 11.15. **
le | se nelci | cu | cafne  
---|---|---|---  
The | liked-thing |  | is-frequent.  
The thing which I like happens often.  
---  
  

which in this context means
> My swimming happens often.
Event descriptions with _le nu_ are commonly used to fill the “under conditions...” places, among others, of gismu and lujvo place structures:
**Example 11.16. **
la | lojban. | cu | frili |  | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Lojban |  | is-easy-for | me  
| le | nu | mi | tadni | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
under-conditions | the | event-of | I | study  
Lojban is easy for me when I study.  
---  
  

(The “when” of the English would also be appropriate for a construction involving a Lojban tense, but the Lojban sentence says more than that the studying is concurrent with the ease.)
The place structure of a __nu__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> x1 is an event of (the bridi)

## 14.18. Tenses, modals, and logical connection
The tense and modal systems of Lojban interact with the logical connective system. No one chapter can explain all of these simultaneously, so each chapter must present its own view of the area of interaction with emphasis on its own concepts and terminology. In the examples of this chapter, the many tenses of various selma'o as well as the modals of selma'o BAI are represented by the simple time cmavo __pu__ , __ca__ , and __ba__ (of selma'o PU) representing the past, the present, and the future respectively. Preceding a selbri, these cmavo state the time when the bridi was, is, or will be true (analogous to English verb tenses); preceding a sumti, they state that the event of the main bridi is before, simultaneous with, or after the event given by the sumti (which is generally a _le nu_ abstraction; see Section 11.2).
The two types of interaction between tenses and logical connectives are logically connected tenses and tensed logical connections. The former are fairly simple. Jeks may be used between tense cmavo to specify two connected bridi that differ only in tense:
**Example 14.155. **
la | .artr. | pu | nolraitru  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | Arthur | [past] | is-a-noblest-governor.  
.ije | la | .artr. | ba | nolraitru  
---|---|---|---|---  
And | that-named | Arthur | [future] | is-a-noblest-governor.  
Arthur was a king, and Arthur will be a king.  
---  
  

can be reduced to:
**Example 14.156. **
la | .artr. | pu | je | ba | nolraitru  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Arthur | [past] | and | [future] | is-a-noblest-governor.  
Arthur was and will be king.  
---  
  

Example 14.155 and Example 14.156 are equivalent in meaning; neither says anything about whether Arthur is king now.
Non-logical connection with joiks is also possible between tenses:
**Example 14.157. **
mi | pu | bi'o | ba | vasxu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | from-...-to | [future] | breathe.  
I breathe from a past time until a future time.

The full tense system makes more interesting tense intervals expressible, such as “from a medium time ago until a long time from now”.
No forethought connections between tenses are permitted by the grammar, nor is there any way to override the default left-grouping rule; these limitations are imposed to keep the tense grammar simpler. Whatever can be said with tenses or modals can be said with subordinate bridi stating the time, place, or mode explicitly, so it is reasonable to try to remove at least some complications.
Tensed logical connections are both more complex and more important than logical connections between tenses. Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.158. **
I went to the market, and I bought food.
  

The verbatim translation of Example 14.158, namely:
**Example 14.159. **
mi | pu | klama | le | zarci | .ije | mi | pu | tervecnu | lo | cidja  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | go-to | the | market. | And | I | [past] | buy | items-of | food.  
  

fails to fully represent a feature of the English, namely that the buying came after the going. (It also fails to represent that the buying was a consequence of the going, which can be expressed by a modal that is discussed in Chapter 9.) However, the tense information – that the event of my going to the market preceded the event of my buying food – can be added to the logical connective as follows. The __.i__ __je__ is replaced by __.i__ __je__ __bo__ , and the tense cmavo __ba__ is inserted between __.i__ __je__ and __bo__ :
**Example 14.160. **
mi | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | go-to | the | market.  
.ije | babo | mi | pu | tervecnu | lo | cidja  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
And | [later] | I | [past] | buy | items-of | food.  
  

Here the __pu__ cmavo in the two bridi-tails express the time of both actions with respect to the speaker: in the past. The __ba__ relates the two items to one another: the second item is later than the first item. The grammar does not permit omitting the __bo__ ; if it were omitted, the __ba__ and the second __pu__ would run together to form a compound tense __bapu__ applying to the second bridi-tail only.
Adding tense or modal information to a logical connective is permitted only in the following situations:
Between an ek (or joik) and __bo__ , as in:
**Example 14.161. **
la | .djan | .e | cabo | la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | and | [simultaneous] | that-named | Alice | go-to | the | market.  
John and Alice go to the market simultaneously.  
---  
  

Between an ek (or joik) and __ke__ , as in:
**Example 14.162. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | pu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | [earlier]  
ke | le | zdani | .a | le | ckule | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | the | house | or | the | school | ).  
I walk to the market and, before that, to the house or the school.  
---  
  

Between a gihek and __bo__ , as in:
**Example 14.163. **
mi | dunda | le | cukta | gi'e | babo  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | give | the | book | and | [later]  
lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
take | some | currency-units |  | from/to-you.  
I give you the book and then take some dollars (pounds, yen) from you.  
---  
  

Between a gihek and __ke__ , as in:
**Example 14.164. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | gi'e | ca  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | [simultaneous]  
ke | cusku | zo'e | la | djan. | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | express | something | to-that-named | John. | )  
I walk to the market and at the same time talk to John.  
---  
  

Between an ijek (or ijoik) and __bo__ , as in:
**Example 14.165. **
mi | viska | pa | nanmu | .ije | babo | mi | viska | pa | ninmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | man. | And | [later] | I | see | a | woman.  
I see a man, and then I see a woman.  
---  
  

Between an ijek (or ijoik) and __tu'e__ , as in:
**Example 14.166. **
mi | viska | pa | nanmu | .ije | batu'e | mi | viska | pa | ninmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | man. | And | [later] | I | see | a | woman.  
I see a man, and then I see a woman.  
---  
  

And finally, between a jek (or joik) and __bo__ , as in:
**Example 14.167. **
mi | mikce | jebabo | ricfu  
---|---|---|---  
I | am-a-doctor | and-[later] | rich  
I am a doctor and future rich person.  
---  
  

As can be seen from Example 14.165 and Example 14.166, the choice between __bo__ and __ke__ (or __tu'e__) is arbitrary when there are only two things to be connected. If there were no tense information to include, of course neither would be required; it is only the rule that tense information must always be sandwiched between the logical connective and a following __bo__ , __ke__ , or __tu'e__ that requires the use of one of these grouping cmavo in Example 14.161 and Example 14.163 through Example 14.167.
Non-logical connectives with __bo__ and __ke__ can include tense information in exactly the same way as logical connectives. Forethought connectives, however (except as noted below) are unable to do so, as are termsets or tense connectives. Mathematical operands and operators can also include tense information in their logical connectives as a result of their close parallelism with sumti and tanru components respectively:
**Example 14.168. **
vei | ci | .ebabo | vo | [ve'o] | tadni | cu | zvati | le | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | 3 | and-[future] | 4 | ) | students |  | are-at | the | room.  
Three and, later, four students were in the room.  
---  
  

is a simple example. There is a special grammatical rule for use when a tense applies to both of the selbri in a forethought bridi-tail connection: the entire forethought construction can just be preceded by a tense. For example:
**Example 14.169. **
mi | pu | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | tervecnu | lo | cidja  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | both | go-to | the | market | and | buy | some | food  
I went to the market and bought some food.  
---  
  

Example 14.169 is similar to Example 14.159. There is no time relationship specified between the going and the buying; both are simply set in the past.

## 3.5. Vowel Pairs
Lojban vowels also occur in pairs, where each vowel sound is in a separate syllable. These two vowel sounds are connected (and separated) by an apostrophe. Lojban vowel pairs should be pronounced continuously with the [h] sound between (and not by a glottal stop or pause, which would split the two vowels into separate words).
All vowel combinations are permitted in two-syllable pairs with the apostrophe separating them; this includes those which constitute diphthongs when the apostrophe is not included.
The Lojban vowel pairs are:
_a'a_ |  _a'e_ |  _a'i_ |  _a'o_ |  _a'u_ |  _a'y_  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
_e'a_ |  _e'e_ |  _e'i_ |  _e'o_ |  _e'u_ |  _e'y_  
_i'a_ |  _i'e_ |  _i'i_ |  _i'o_ |  _i'u_ |  _i'y_  
_o'a_ |  _o'e_ |  _o'i_ |  _o'o_ |  _o'u_ |  _o'y_  
_u'a_ |  _u'e_ |  _u'i_ |  _u'o_ |  _u'u_ |  _u'y_  
_y'a_ |  _y'e_ |  _y'i_ |  _y'o_ |  _y'u_ |  _y'y_  
Vowel pairs involving _y_ appear only in Lojbanized names. They could appear in cmavo (structure words), but only __.y'y.__ is so used – it is the Lojban name of the apostrophe letter (see Section 17.2).
When more than two vowels occur together in Lojban, the normal pronunciation pairs vowels from the left into syllables, as in the Lojbanized name:
**Example 3.6. **
  * meiin.
  * mei,in.


  

Example 3.6 contains the diphthong _ei_ followed by the vowel _i_. In order to indicate a different grouping, the comma must always be used, leading to:
**Example 3.7. **
  * me,iin.


  

which contains the vowel _e_ followed by the diphthong _ii_. In rough English representation, Example 3.6 is “May Een”, whereas Example 3.7 is “Meh Yeen”.

## 10.28. List of spatial directions and direction-like relations
The following list of FAhA cmavo gives rough English glosses for the cmavo, first when used without __mo'i__ to express a direction, and then when used with __mo'i__ to express movement in the direction. When possible, the gismu from which the cmavo is derived is also listed.
ca'u |  crane |  in front (of) |  forward  
---|---|---|---  
ti'a |  trixe |  behind |  backward  
zu'a |  zunle |  on the left (of) |  leftward  
ga'u |  gapru |  above |  upward(ly)  
ni'a |  cnita |  below |  downward(ly)  
ne'i |  nenri |  within |  into  
ru'u |  sruri |  surrounding |  orbiting  
pa'o |  pagre |  transfixing |  passing through  
ne'a |  |  next to |  moving while next to   
te'e |  |  bordering |  moving along the border (of)  
re'o |  |  adjacent (to) |  along  
fa'a |  farna |  towards |  arriving at  
to'o |  |  away from |  departing from  
zo'i |  |  inward (from) |  approaching  
ze'o |  |  outward (from) |  receding from  
zo'a |  |  tangential (to) |  passing (by)  
be'a |  berti |  north (of) |  northward(ly)  
ne'u |  snanu |  south (of) |  southward(ly)  
du'a |  stuna |  east (of) |  eastward(ly)  
vu'a |  |  west (of) |  westward(ly)  
Special note on __fa'a__ , __to'o__ , __zo'i__ , and __ze'o__ :
__zo'i__ and __ze'o__ refer to direction towards or away from the speaker's location, or whatever the origin is.
__fa'a__ and __to'o__ refer to direction towards or away from some other point.
