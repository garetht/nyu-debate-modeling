## 13.16. Tentative conclusion
The exact ramifications of the indicator system in actual usage are unknown. There has never been anything like it in natural language before. The system provides great potential for emotional expression and transcription, from which significant Sapir-Whorf effects can be anticipated. When communicating across cultural boundaries, where different indicators are often used for the same emotion, accidental offense can be avoided. If we ever ran into an alien race, a culturally neutral language of emotion could be vital. (A classic example, taken from the science fiction of Larry Niven, is to imagine speaking Lojban to the carnivorous warriors called Kzinti, noting that a human smile bares the teeth, and could be seen as an intent to attack.) And for communicating emotions to computers, when we cannot identify all of the signals involved in subliminal human communication (things like body language are also cultural), a system like this is needed.
We have tried to err on the side of overkill. There are distinctions possible in this system that no one may care to make in any culture. But it was deemed more neutral to overspecify and let usage decide, than to choose a limited set and constrain emotional expression. For circumstances in which even the current indicator set is not enough, it is possible using the cmavo __sei__ , explained in Section 19.12, to create metalinguistic comments that act like indicators.
We envision an evolutionary development. At this point, the system is little more than a mental toy. Many of you who read this will try playing around with various combinations of indicators, trying to figure out what emotions they express and when the expressions might be useful. You may even find an expression for which there currently is no good English word and start using it. Why not, if it helps you express your feelings?
There will be a couple dozen of these used pretty much universally – mostly just simple attitudinals with, at most, intensity markers. These are the ones that will quickly be expressed at the subconscious level. But every Lojbanist who plays with the list will bring in a couple of new words. Poets will paint emotional pictures, and people who identify with those pictures will use the words so created for their own experiences.
Just as a library of tanru is built up, so will a library of attitudes be built. Unlike the tanru, though, the emotional expressions are built on some fairly nebulous root emotions – words that cannot be defined with the precision of the gismu. The emotion words of Lojban will very quickly take on a life of their own, and the outline given here will evolve into a true system of emotions.
There are several theories as to the nature of emotion, and they change from year to year as we learn more about ourselves. Whether or not Lojban's additive/scalar emotional model is an accurate model for human emotions, it does support the linguistic needs for expressing those emotions. Researchers may learn more about the nature of human emotions by exploring the use of the system by Lojban speakers. They also may be able to use the Lojban system as a means for more clearly recording emotions.
The full list of scales and attitudes will probably not be used until someone speaks the language from birth. Until then, people will use the attitudes that are important to them. In this way, we counter cultural bias – if a culture is prone to recognizing and/or expressing certain emotions more than others, its members will use only those out of the enormous set available. If a culture hides certain emotions, its members simply won't express them.
Perhaps native Lojban speakers will be more expressively clear about their emotions than others. Perhaps they will feel some emotions more strongly than others in ways that can be correlated with the word choices; any difference from the norms of other cultures could be significant. Psychologists have devised elaborate tests for measuring attitudes and personality; this may be the easiest area in which to detect any systematic cultural effect of the type sought to confirm Sapir-Whorf, simply because we already have tools in existence to test it. Because Lojban is unique among languages in having such extensive and expressive indicators, it is likely that a Sapir-Whorf effect will occur and will be recognized.
It is unlikely that we will know the true potential of a system like this one until and unless we have children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking environment. We learn too many cultural habits in the realm of emotional communication “at our mother's knee”. Such children will have a Lojban system that has stronger reinforcement than any typical culture system. The second generation of such children, then, could be said to be the start of a true Lojbanic culture.
We shouldn't need to wait that long to detect significant effects. Emotion is so basic to our lives that even a small change or improvement in emotional communication would have immediately noticeable effects. Perhaps it will be the case that the most important contribution of our “logical language” will be in the non-logical realm of emotion!

## 7.15. lujvo based on pro-sumti
There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See Section 7.16 for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.
Thus __donta'a__ , meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted as _tavla be do_ , and would have the place structure
**Example 7.76. **
> t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
  

since `t2` (the addressee) is already known to be __do__.
On the other hand, the lujvo __donma'o__ , literally “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal pronoun”, would be interpreted as _cmavo be zo do_ , and have the place structure:
**Example 7.77. **
> c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
  

since both the `c2` place (the grammatical class) and the `c3` place (the meaning) are obvious from the context __do__.
An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the __fo'a__ series is to express lujvo which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An example would be:
**Example 7.78. **
fo'a | goi | le | kulnrsu,omi | .i | lo | fo'arselsanga  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x6 | stands-for | the | Finnish-culture | . | An | x6-song.  
  

Finally, lujvo involving __zi'o__ are also possible, and are fully discussed in Chapter 12. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for __zi'o__ as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a _se pinxe be zi'o_ , the lujvo corresponding to this is _zilrelselpinxe_ (deleting the second place of _se pinxe_). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that _zilpavypinxe_ has the same place structure as _zilrelselpinxe_ , and _lo zilpavypinxe_ , like _lo zilrelselpinxe_ , refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ , __du__ , and __bu'a__ also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for _du-_ based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.

## 15.9. Affirmations
There is an explicit positive form for both selma'o NA (__ja'a__) and selma'o NAhE (__je'a__), each of which would supplant the corresponding negator in the grammatical position used, allowing one to assert the positive in response to a negative question or statement without confusion. Assuming the same context as in Section 15.8:
**Example 15.89. **
xu | na | go'i  
---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that | [false] | [repeat-previous]?  
  

or equivalently
**Example 15.90. **
xu | la | djan. | [cu] | na | pu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that: | that-named | John |  | [false] | previously  
klama | la | paris. | .e | la | rom.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
went-to | that-name | Paris | and | that-named | Rome.  
  

The obvious, but incorrect, positive response to this negative question is:
**Example 15.91. **
go'i  
---  
[repeat-previous]  
---  
  

A plain __go'i__ does not mean “Yes it is”; it merely abbreviates repeating the previous statement unmodified, including any negators present; and Example 15.91 actually states that it is false that John went to both Paris and Rome.
When considering:
**Example 15.92. **
na | go'i  
---|---  
[false] | [repeat-previous]  
  

as a response to a negative question like Example 15.90, Lojban designers had to choose between two equally plausible interpretations with opposite effects. Does Example 15.92 create a double negative in the sentence by adding a new __na__ to the one already there (forming a double negative and hence a positive statement), or does the __na__ replace the previous one, leaving the sentence unchanged?
It was decided that substitution, the latter alternative, is the preferable choice, since it is then clear whether we intend a positive or a negative sentence without performing any manipulations. This is the way English usually works, but not all languages work this way – Russian, Japanese, and Navajo all interpret a negative reply to a negative question as positive.
The positive assertion cmavo of selma'o NA, which is "ja'a", can also replace the __na__ in the context, giving:
**Example 15.93. **
ja'a | go'i  
---|---  
[true] | [repeat-previous]  
John did go to Paris and Rome.  
---  
  

__ja'a__ can replace __na__ in a similar manner wherever the latter is used:
**Example 15.94. **
mi | ja'a | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [true] | go-to | the | store  
I indeed go to the store.  
---  
  

__je'a__ can replace __na'e__ in exactly the same way, stating that scalar negation does not apply, and that the relation indeed holds as stated. In the absence of a negation context, it emphasizes the positive:
**Example 15.95. **
ta | je'a | melbi  
---|---|---  
that | is-indeed | beautiful.

## 8.2. Incidental relative clauses
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
noi |  NOI |  incidental relative clause introducer  
---|---|---  
There are two basic kinds of relative clauses: restrictive relative clauses introduced by __poi__ , and incidental (sometimes called simply “non-restrictive”) relative clauses introduced by __noi__. The difference between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide information that is essential to identifying the referent of the sumti to which they are attached, whereas incidental relative clauses provide additional information which is helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying the referent of the sumti. All of the examples in Section 8.1 are restrictive relative clauses: the information in the relative clause is essential to identification. (The title of this chapter, though, uses an incidental relative clause.)
Consider the following examples:
**Example 8.12. **
le | gerku | poi | blanu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which | is-blue |  | is-large.  
The dog which is blue is large.  
---  
  

**Example 8.13. **
le | gerku | noi | blanu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | incidentally-which | is-blue |  | is-large.  
The dog, which is blue, is large.  
---  
  

In Example 8.12, the information conveyed by _poi blanu_ is essential to identifying the dog in question: it restricts the possible referents from dogs in general to dogs that are blue. This is why __poi__ relative clauses are called restrictive. In Example 8.13, on the other hand, the dog which is referred to has presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative clause _noi blanu_ just provides additional information about it. (If in fact the dog hasn't been identified clearly, then the relative clause does not help identify it further.)
In English, the distinction between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is expressed in writing by surrounding incidental, but not restrictive, clauses with commas. These commas are functioning as parentheses, because incidental relative clauses are essentially parenthetical. This distinction in punctuation is represented in speech by a difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive relative clauses can be introduced by “that” as well as “which” and “who”, whereas incidental relative clauses cannot begin with “that”. Lojban, however, always uses the cmavo __poi__ and __noi__ rather than punctuation or intonation to make the distinction.
Here are more examples of incidental relative clauses:
**Example 8.14. **
mi | noi | pajni | cu | zvati  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | who-incidentally | am-a-judge |  | am-at | [some-place].  
I, a judge, am present.  
---  
  

In this example, __mi__ is already sufficiently restricted, and the additional information that I am a judge is being provided solely for the listener's edification.
**Example 8.15. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | karce | noi | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | car | incidentally-which | is-white.  
Do you see my car, which is white?  
---  
  

In Example 8.15, the speaker is presumed to have only one car, and is providing incidental information that it is white. (Alternatively, he or she might have more than one car, since _le karce_ can be plural, in which case the incidental information is that each of them is white.) Contrast Example 8.16 with a restrictive relative clause:
**Example 8.16. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | karce | poi | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | car | which | is-white.  
Do you see my car that is white?  
---  
Do you see my white car?  
  

Here the speaker probably has several cars, and is restricting the referent of the sumti _le mi karce_ (and thereby the listener's attention) to the white one only. Example 8.16 means much the same as Example 8.17, which does not use a relative clause:
**Example 8.17. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | blabi | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | white | car.  
Do you see my car, the white one?  
---  
  

So a restrictive relative clause attached to a description can often mean the same as a description involving a tanru. However, _blabi karce_ , like all tanru, is somewhat vague: in principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things, or even express some more complicated concept involving whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative clause of Example 8.16 can only refer to a car which is white, not to any more complex or extended concept.

## 18.8. Indefinite numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ro |  PA |  all  
---|---|---  
so'a |  PA |  almost all  
so'e |  PA |  most  
so'i |  PA |  many  
so'o |  PA |  several  
so'u |  PA |  a few  
no'o |  PA |  the typical number of  
da'a |  PA |  all but (one) of  
piro |  PA+PA |  the whole of/all of  
piso'a |  PA+PA |  almost the whole of  
piso'e |  PA+PA |  most of  
piso'i |  PA+PA |  much of  
piso'o |  PA+PA |  a small part of  
piso'u |  PA+PA |  a tiny part of  
pino'o |  PA+PA |  the typical portion of  
rau |  PA |  enough  
du'e |  PA |  too many  
mo'a |  PA |  too few  
pirau |  PA+PA |  enough of  
pidu'e |  PA+PA |  too much of  
pimo'a |  PA+PA |  too little of  
Not all the cmavo of PA represent numbers in the usual mathematical sense. For example, the cmavo __ro__ means “all” or “each”. This number does not have a definite value in the abstract: _li ro_ is undefined. But when used to count or quantify something, the parallel between __ro__ and __pa__ is clearer:
**Example 18.41. **
mi | catlu | pa | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | one | person  
  

**Example 18.42. **
mi | catlu | ro | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all | persons  
  

Example 18.41 might be true, whereas Example 18.42 is almost certainly false.
The cmavo __so'a__ , __so'e__ , __so'i__ , __so'o__ , and __so'u__ represent a set of indefinite numbers less than __ro__. As you go down an alphabetical list, the magnitude decreases:
**Example 18.43. **
mi | catlu | so'a | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | almost-all | persons  
  

**Example 18.44. **
mi | catlu | so'e | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | most | persons  
  

**Example 18.45. **
mi | catlu | so'i | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | many | persons  
  

**Example 18.46. **
mi | catlu | so'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | several | persons  
  

**Example 18.47. **
mi | catlu | so'u | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | a-few | persons  
  

The English equivalents are only rough: the cmavo provide space for up to five indefinite numbers between __ro__ and __no__ , with a built-in ordering. In particular, __so'e__ does not mean “most” in the sense of “a majority” or “more than half”.
Each of these numbers, plus __ro__ , may be prefixed with __pi__ (the decimal point) in order to make a fractional form which represents part of a whole rather than some elements of a totality. __piro__ therefore means “the whole of”:
**Example 18.48. **
mi | citka | piro | lei | nanba  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | eat | the-whole-of | the-mass-of | bread  
  

Similarly, __piso'a__ means “almost the whole of”; and so on down to __piso'u__ , “a tiny part of”. These numbers are particularly appropriate with masses, which are usually measured rather than counted, as Example 18.48 shows.
In addition to these cmavo, there is __no'o__ , meaning “the typical value”, and _pino'o_ , meaning “the typical portion”: Sometimes __no'o__ can be translated “the average value”, but the average in question is not, in general, a mathematical mean, median, or mode; these would be more appropriately represented by operators.
**Example 18.49. **
mi | catlu | no'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | a-typical-number-of | persons  
  

**Example 18.50. **
mi | citka | pino'o | lei | nanba  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | eat | a-typical-amount-of | the-mass-of | bread.  
  

__da'a__ is a related cmavo meaning “all but”:
**Example 18.51. **
mi | catlu | da'a | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all-but | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.52. **
mi | catlu | da'a | so'u | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all-but | a-few | persons  
  

Example 18.52 is similar in meaning to Example 18.43.
If no number follows __da'a__ , then __pa__ is assumed; __da'a__ by itself means “all but one”, or in ordinal contexts “all but the last”:
**Example 18.53. **
ro | ratcu | ka'e | citka | da'a | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | rats | can | eat | all-but-one | rats.  
All rats can eat all other rats.  
---  
  

(The use of __da'a__ means that Example 18.53 does not require that all rats can eat themselves, but does allow it. Each rat has one rat it cannot eat, but that one might be some rat other than itself. Context often dictates that “itself” is, indeed, the “other” rat.)
As mentioned in Section 18.3, __ma'u__ and __ni'u__ are also legal numbers, and they mean “some positive number” and “some negative number” respectively.
**Example 18.54. **
li | ci | vu'u | re | du | li | ma'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 3 | − | 2 | = |  | some-positive-number  
  

**Example 18.55. **
li | ci | vu'u | vo | du | li | ni'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 3 | − | 4 | = |  | some-negative-number  
  

**Example 18.56. **
mi | ponse | ma'u | rupnu  
---|---|---|---  
I | possess | a-positive-number-of | currency-units.  
  

All of the numbers discussed so far are objective, even if indefinite. If there are exactly six superpowers (_rairgugde_ , “superlative-states”) in the world, then _ro rairgugde_ means the same as _xa rairgugde_. It is often useful, however, to express subjective indefinite values. The cmavo __rau__ (enough), __du'e__ (too many), and __mo'a__ (too few) are then appropriate:
**Example 18.57. **
mi | ponse | rau | rupnu  
---|---|---|---  
I | possess | enough | currency-units.  
  

Like the __so'a__ -series, __rau__ , __du'e__ , and __mo'a__ can be preceded by __pi__ ; for example, _pirau_ means “a sufficient part of.”
Another possibility is that of combining definite and indefinite numbers into a single number. This usage implies that the two kinds of numbers have the same value in the given context:
**Example 18.58. **
mi | viska | le | rore | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | all-of/two | dogs.  
I saw both dogs.  
---  
  

**Example 18.59. **
mi | speni | so'ici | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | am-married-to | many/three | persons.  
I am married to three persons (which is “many” in the circumstances).  
---  
  

Example 18.59 assumes a mostly monogamous culture by stating that three is “many”.

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).  
---

## 11.8. Indirect questions
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
kau |  UI |  indirect question marker  
---|---|---  
There is an alternative type of sentence involving __du'u__ and a selbri expressing a propositional attitude. In addition to sentences like
**Example 11.50. **
I know that John went to the store.
  

we can also say things like
**Example 11.51. **
I know who went to the store.
  

This form is called an “indirect question” in English because the embedded English sentence is a question: “Who went to the store?” A person who says Example 11.51 is claiming to know the answer to this question. Indirect questions can occur with many other English verbs as well: I can wonder, or doubt, or see, or hear, as well as know who went to the store.
To express indirect questions in Lojban, we use a _le du'u_ abstraction, but rather than using a question word like “who” (__ma__ in Lojban), we use any word that will fit grammatically and mark it with the suffix particle __kau__. This cmavo belongs to selma'o UI, so grammatically it can appear anywhere. The simplest Lojban translation of Example 11.51 is therefore:
**Example 11.52. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u  
---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of  
ma | kau | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
X | [indirect-question] | [past] | going-to | the | store.  
  

In Example 11.52, we have chosen to use __ma__ as the word marked by __kau__. In fact, any other sumti would have done as well: __zo'e__ or __da__ or even _la djan._. Using _la djan._ would suggest that it was John who I knew had gone to the store, however:
**Example 11.53. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u  
---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of/fact-that  
la | djan. | kau | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | John | [indirect-question] | [past] | going-to | the | store.  
I know who went to the store, namely John.  
---  
I know that it was John who went to the store.  
  

Using one of the indefinite pro-sumti such as __ma__ , __zo'e__ , or __da__ does not suggest any particular value.
Why does Lojban require the __kau__ marker, rather than using __ma__ as English and Chinese and many other languages do? Because __ma__ always signals a direct question, and so
**Example 11.54. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | ma | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of | [what sumti?] | [past] | goes-to | the | store  
  

means
**Example 11.55. **
Who is it that I know goes to the store?
  

It is actually not necessary to use _le du'u_ and __kau__ at all if the indirect question involves a sumti; there is generally a paraphrase of the type:
**Example 11.56. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | pu | klama | be | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the | [past] | goer | to | the | store.  
I know something about the one who went to the store (namely, his identity).  
---  
  

because the x3 place of __djuno__ is the subject of knowledge, as opposed to the fact that is known. But when the questioned point is not a sumti, but (say) a logical connection, then there is no good alternative to __kau__ :
**Example 11.57. **
mi | ba | zgana | le | du'u | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | observe | the | predication-of/fact-that | that-named | John  
jikau | la | djordj. | cu | zvati | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[connective-indirect-question] | that-named | George |  | is-at | the | park.  
I will see whether John or George (or both) is at the park.  
---  
  

In addition, Example 11.56 is only a loose paraphrase of Example 11.52, because it is left to the listener's insight to realize that what is known about the goer-to-the-store is his identity rather than some other of his attributes.

## 11.7. Predication/sentence abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
du'u |  NU |  predication abstraction  
---|---|---  
There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:
**Example 11.42. **
I know that Frank is a fool.
  

How's that in Lojban? Let us try:
**Example 11.43. **
mi | djuno | le | nu | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the event of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can't be contained inside one's mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; Example 11.43 comes close to claiming that Frank's being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, Example 11.43 is an instance of improperly marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in Section 11.10).
Try again:
**Example 11.44. **
mi | djuno | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Closer. Example 11.44 says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn't say that he is one, as Example 11.42 does. To catch that nuance, we must say:
**Example 11.45. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the predication that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a fool” is not a property of _le du'u_ abstraction, but of __djuno__ ; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, __djuno__ like __jei__ has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) Example 11.46 has no such implied assertion:
**Example 11.46. **
mi | kucli | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

and here __du'u__ could probably be replaced by __jei__ without much change in meaning:
**Example 11.47. **
mi | kucli | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about how true it is that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, __du'u__ has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:
> _ _du'u_ _ x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2
and _le se du'u ..._ is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:
**Example 11.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | le | se du'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses | the | (sentence-expressing-that  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes-to | the | store | )  
John says that George goes to the store.  
---  
  

Example 11.48 differs from
**Example 11.49. **
la | djan | cusku | lu  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses, | quote,  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes | to-the | store, | unquote.  
John says “George goes to the store”.  
---  
  

because Example 11.49 claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas Example 11.48 claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.
_le se du'u_ is much the same as _lu'e le du'u_ , a symbol for the predication, but _se du'u_ can be used as a selbri, whereas __lu'e__ is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See Section 6.10 for a discussion of __lu'e__.)

## 10.15. Tenses in subordinate bridi
English has a set of rules, formally known as “sequence of tense rules”, for determining what tense should be used in a subordinate clause, depending on the tense used in the main sentence. Here are some examples:
**Example 10.100. **
John says that George is going to the market.
  

**Example 10.101. **
John says that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.102. **
John said that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.103. **
John said that George had gone to the market.
  

In Example 10.100 and Example 10.101, the tense of the main sentence is the present: “says”. If George goes when John speaks, we get the present tense “is going” (“goes” would be unidiomatic); if George goes before John speaks, we get the past tense “went”. But if the tense of the main sentence is the past, with “said”, then the tense required in the subordinate clause is different. If George goes when John speaks, we get the past tense “went”; if George goes before John speaks, we get the past-perfect tense “had gone”.
The rule of English, therefore, is that both the tense of the main sentence and the tense of the subordinate clause are understood relative to the speaker of the main sentence (not John, but the person who speaks Example 10.100 through Example 10.103).
Lojban, like Russian and Esperanto, uses a different convention. A tense in a subordinate bridi is understood to be relative to the tense already set in the main bridi. Thus Example 10.100 through Example 10.103 can be expressed in Lojban respectively thus:
**Example 10.104. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.105. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.106. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.107. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

Probably the most counterintuitive of the Lojban examples is Example 10.106. The __ca__ looks quite odd, as if George were going to the market right now, rather than back when John spoke. But this __ca__ is really a __ca__ with respect to a reference point specified by the outer __pu__. This behavior is the same as the additive behavior of multiple tenses in the same bridi, as explained in Section 10.13.
There is a special cmavo __nau__ (of selma'o CUhE) which can be used to override these rules and get to the speaker's current reference point. (Yes, it sounds like English “now”.) It is not grammatical to combine __nau__ with any other cmavo in a tense, except by way of a logical or non-logical connection (see Section 10.20). Here is a convoluted sentence with several nested bridi which uses __nau__ at the lowest level:
**Example 10.108. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | .alis | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | maris. | nau | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Mary | [now] | goes-to | the | market.  
John said that Alice had said that George had earlier said that Mary is now going to the market.  
---  
  

The use of __nau__ does not affect sticky tenses.

## 11.7. Predication/sentence abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
du'u |  NU |  predication abstraction  
---|---|---  
There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:
**Example 11.42. **
I know that Frank is a fool.
  

How's that in Lojban? Let us try:
**Example 11.43. **
mi | djuno | le | nu | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the event of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can't be contained inside one's mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; Example 11.43 comes close to claiming that Frank's being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, Example 11.43 is an instance of improperly marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in Section 11.10).
Try again:
**Example 11.44. **
mi | djuno | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Closer. Example 11.44 says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn't say that he is one, as Example 11.42 does. To catch that nuance, we must say:
**Example 11.45. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the predication that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a fool” is not a property of _le du'u_ abstraction, but of __djuno__ ; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, __djuno__ like __jei__ has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) Example 11.46 has no such implied assertion:
**Example 11.46. **
mi | kucli | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

and here __du'u__ could probably be replaced by __jei__ without much change in meaning:
**Example 11.47. **
mi | kucli | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about how true it is that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, __du'u__ has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:
> _ _du'u_ _ x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2
and _le se du'u ..._ is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:
**Example 11.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | le | se du'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses | the | (sentence-expressing-that  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes-to | the | store | )  
John says that George goes to the store.  
---  
  

Example 11.48 differs from
**Example 11.49. **
la | djan | cusku | lu  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses, | quote,  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes | to-the | store, | unquote.  
John says “George goes to the store”.  
---  
  

because Example 11.49 claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas Example 11.48 claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.
_le se du'u_ is much the same as _lu'e le du'u_ , a symbol for the predication, but _se du'u_ can be used as a selbri, whereas __lu'e__ is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See Section 6.10 for a discussion of __lu'e__.)

## 7.9. sumti and bridi questions: _ma_ and _mo_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ma |  KOhA |  sumti question  
---|---|---  
mo |  GOhA |  bridi question  
Lojban questions are more fully explained in Section 19.5, but __ma__ and __mo__ are listed in this chapter for completeness. The cmavo __ma__ asks for a sumti to make the bridi true:
**Example 7.63. **
do | klama | ma  
---|---|---  
You | go-to | what?  
Where are you going?  
---  
  

The cmavo __mo__ , on the other hand, asks for a selbri which makes the question bridi true. If the answer is a full bridi, then the arguments of the answer override the arguments in the question, in the same manner as the go'i-series cmavo. A simple example is:
**Example 7.64. **
do mo  
---  
What predicate is true as applied to you?  
---  
How are you?  
What are you doing?  
What are you?  
  

Example 7.65 is a truly pregnant question that will have several meanings depending on context.
(One thing it probably does not mean is “Who are you?” in the sense “What is your name/identity?”, which is better expressed by:
**Example 7.65. **
ma | cmene | do  
---|---|---  
What-sumti | is-the-name-of | you?  
What is your name?  
---  
  

or even
**Example 7.66. **
doi | ma  
---|---  
O | [what sumti?]  
  

which uses the vocative __doi__ to address someone, and simultaneously asks who the someone is.)
A further example of __mo__ :
**Example 7.67. **
lo | mo |  | prenu | cu | darxi | do | .i | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | [what selbri?] | type-of | person |  | hit | you? |  | A big thing.  
Which person hit you? The big one.  
---  
  

When __ma__ or __mo__ is repeated, multiple questions are being asked simultaneously:
**Example 7.68. **
ma | djuno | ma  
---|---|---  
[What-sumti] | knows | [what-sumti]?  
Who knows what?  
---

## 19.5. Questions and answers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
xu |  UI |  truth question  
---|---|---  
ma |  KOhA |  sumti question  
mo |  GOhA |  bridi question  
xo |  PA |  number question  
ji |  A |  sumti connective question  
ge'i |  GA |  forethought connective question  
gi'i |  GIhA |  bridi-tail connective question  
gu'i |  GUhA |  tanru forethought connective question  
je'i |  JA |  tanru connective question  
pei |  UI |  attitude question  
fi'a |  FA |  place structure question  
cu'e |  CUhE |  tense/modal question  
pau |  UI |  question premarker  
Lojban questions are not at all like English questions. There are two basic types: truth questions, of the form “Is it true that ...”, and fill-in-the-blank questions. Truth questions are marked by preceding the bridi, or following any part of it specifically questioned, with the cmavo __xu__ (of selma'o UI):
**Example 19.13. **
xu | do | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
[True-or-false?] | You | go-to | the | store  
Are you going to the store/Did you go to the store?  
---  
  

(Since the Lojban is tenseless, either colloquial translation might be correct.) Truth questions are further discussed in Section 15.8.
Fill-in-the-blank questions have a cmavo representing some Lojban word or phrase which is not known to the questioner, and which the answerer is to supply. There are a variety of cmavo belonging to different selma'o which provide different kinds of blanks.
Where a sumti is not known, a question may be formed with __ma__ (of selma'o KOhA), which is a kind of pro-sumti:
**Example 19.14. **
ma | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
[What-sumti?] | goes-to | the | store  
Who is going to the store?  
---  
  

Of course, the __ma__ need not be in the x1 place:
**Example 19.15. **
do | klama | ma  
---|---|---  
You | go-to | [what-sumti?]  
Where are you going?  
---  
  

The answer is a simple sumti:
**Example 19.16. **
le zarci  
---  
The store.  
---  
  

A sumti, then, is a legal utterance, although it does not by itself constitute a bridi – it does not claim anything, but merely completes the open-ended claim of the previous bridi.
There can be two __ma__ cmavo in a single question:
**Example 19.17. **
ma klama ma  
---  
Who goes where?  
---  
  

and the answer would be two sumti, which are meant to fill in the two __ma__ cmavo in order:
**Example 19.18. **
mi | le | zarci  
---|---|---  
I, | [to]-the | store.  
  

An even more complex example, depending on the non-logical connective __fa'u__ (of selma'o JOI), which is like the English “and ... respectively”:
**Example 19.19. **
ma | fa'u | ma | klama | ma | fa'u | ma  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Who and who goes where and where, -respectively?  
---  
  

An answer might be
**Example 19.20. **
la | djan. | la | marcas. | le | zarci | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John, |  | Marsha, | the | store, | the | office.  
John and Marsha go to the store and the office, respectively.  
---  
  

(Note: A mechanical substitution of Example 19.20 into Example 19.19 produces an ungrammatical result, because _* ... le zarci fa'u le briju_ is ungrammatical Lojban: the first _le zarci_ has to be closed with its proper terminator __ku__ , for reasons explained in Section 14.14. This effect is not important: Lojban behaves as if all elided terminators have been supplied in both question and answer before inserting the latter into the former. The exchange is grammatical if question and answer are each separately grammatical.)
Questions to be answered with a selbri are expressed with __mo__ of selma'o GOhA, which is a kind of pro-bridi:
**Example 19.21. **
la | lojban. | mo  
---|---|---  
| Lojban | [what-selbri?]  
What is Lojban?  
---  
  

Here the answerer is to supply some predicate which is true of Lojban. Such questions are extremely open-ended, due to the enormous range of possible predicate answers. The answer might be just a selbri, or might be a full bridi, in which case the sumti in the answer override those provided by the questioner. To limit the range of a __mo__ question, make it part of a tanru.
Questions about numbers are expressed with __xo__ of selma'o PA:
**Example 19.22. **
do | viska | xo | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
You | saw | [what-number?] | persons.  
How many people did you see?  
---  
  

The answer would be a simple number, another kind of non-bridi utterance:
**Example 19.23. **
vomu  
---  
Forty-five.  
  

Fill-in-the-blank questions may also be asked about: logical connectives (using cmavo __ji__ of A, __ge'i__ of GA, __gi'i__ of GIhA, __gu'i__ of GUhA, or __je'i__ of JA, and receiving an ek, gihek, ijek, or ijoik as an answer) – see Section 14.13; attitudes (using __pei__ of UI, and receiving an attitudinal as an answer) – see Section 13.10; place structures (using __fi'a__ of FA, and receiving a cmavo of FA as an answer) – see Section 9.3; tenses and modals (using __cu'e__ of CUhE, and receiving any tense or BAI cmavo as an answer) – see Section 9.6 and Chapter 10.
Questions can be marked by placing __pau__ (of selma'o UI) before the question bridi. See Section 13.13 for details.
The full list of non-bridi utterances suitable as answers to questions is:
  * any number of sumti (with elidable terminator __vau__ , see Chapter 6)
  * an ek or gihek (logical connectives, see Chapter 14)
  * a number, or any mathematical expression placed in parentheses (see Chapter 18)
  * a bare __na__ negator (to negate some previously expressed bridi), or corresponding __ja'a__ affirmer (see Chapter 15)
  * a relative clause (to modify some previously expressed sumti, see Chapter 8)
  * a prenex/topic (to modify some previously expressed bridi, see Chapter 16)
  * linked arguments (beginning with __be__ or __bei__ and attached to some previously expressed selbri, often in a description, see Section 5.7)


At the beginning of a text, the following non-bridi are also permitted:
  * one or more names (to indicate direct address without __doi__ , see Chapter 6)
  * indicators (to express a prevailing attitude, see Chapter 13)
  * __nai__ (to vaguely negate something or other, see Section 15.7)


Where not needed for the expression of answers, most of these are made grammatical for pragmatic reasons: people will say them in conversation, and there is no reason to rule them out as ungrammatical merely because most of them are vague.

## 11.8. Indirect questions
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
kau |  UI |  indirect question marker  
---|---|---  
There is an alternative type of sentence involving __du'u__ and a selbri expressing a propositional attitude. In addition to sentences like
**Example 11.50. **
I know that John went to the store.
  

we can also say things like
**Example 11.51. **
I know who went to the store.
  

This form is called an “indirect question” in English because the embedded English sentence is a question: “Who went to the store?” A person who says Example 11.51 is claiming to know the answer to this question. Indirect questions can occur with many other English verbs as well: I can wonder, or doubt, or see, or hear, as well as know who went to the store.
To express indirect questions in Lojban, we use a _le du'u_ abstraction, but rather than using a question word like “who” (__ma__ in Lojban), we use any word that will fit grammatically and mark it with the suffix particle __kau__. This cmavo belongs to selma'o UI, so grammatically it can appear anywhere. The simplest Lojban translation of Example 11.51 is therefore:
**Example 11.52. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u  
---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of  
ma | kau | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
X | [indirect-question] | [past] | going-to | the | store.  
  

In Example 11.52, we have chosen to use __ma__ as the word marked by __kau__. In fact, any other sumti would have done as well: __zo'e__ or __da__ or even _la djan._. Using _la djan._ would suggest that it was John who I knew had gone to the store, however:
**Example 11.53. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u  
---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of/fact-that  
la | djan. | kau | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | John | [indirect-question] | [past] | going-to | the | store.  
I know who went to the store, namely John.  
---  
I know that it was John who went to the store.  
  

Using one of the indefinite pro-sumti such as __ma__ , __zo'e__ , or __da__ does not suggest any particular value.
Why does Lojban require the __kau__ marker, rather than using __ma__ as English and Chinese and many other languages do? Because __ma__ always signals a direct question, and so
**Example 11.54. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | ma | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of | [what sumti?] | [past] | goes-to | the | store  
  

means
**Example 11.55. **
Who is it that I know goes to the store?
  

It is actually not necessary to use _le du'u_ and __kau__ at all if the indirect question involves a sumti; there is generally a paraphrase of the type:
**Example 11.56. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | pu | klama | be | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the | [past] | goer | to | the | store.  
I know something about the one who went to the store (namely, his identity).  
---  
  

because the x3 place of __djuno__ is the subject of knowledge, as opposed to the fact that is known. But when the questioned point is not a sumti, but (say) a logical connection, then there is no good alternative to __kau__ :
**Example 11.57. **
mi | ba | zgana | le | du'u | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | observe | the | predication-of/fact-that | that-named | John  
jikau | la | djordj. | cu | zvati | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[connective-indirect-question] | that-named | George |  | is-at | the | park.  
I will see whether John or George (or both) is at the park.  
---  
  

In addition, Example 11.56 is only a loose paraphrase of Example 11.52, because it is left to the listener's insight to realize that what is known about the goer-to-the-store is his identity rather than some other of his attributes.

## 13.13. Miscellaneous indicators
Some indicators do not fall neatly into the categories of attitudinal, evidential, or discursive. This section discusses the following miscellaneous indicators:
ki'a |  metalinguistic confusion  
---|---  
na'i |  metalinguistic negator  
jo'a |  metalinguistic affirmer  
li'o |  omitted text (quoted material)  
sa'a |  material inserted by editor/narrator  
xu |  true-false question  
pau |  question premarker |  |  rhetorical question  
pe'a |  figurative language |  |  literal language  
bi'u |  new information |  |  old information  
ge'e |  non-specific indicator  
The cmavo __ki'a__ is one of the most common of the miscellaneous indicators. It expresses metalinguistic confusion; i.e. confusion about what has been said, as opposed to confusion not tied to the discourse (which is __.uanai__). The confusion may be about the meaning of a word or of a grammatical construct, or about the referent of a sumti. One of the uses of English “which” corresponds to __ki'a__ :
**Example 13.90. **
mi | nelci | le | ctuca  
---|---|---|---  
I | like | the | teacher.  
.i | le | ki'a | ctuca  
---|---|---|---  
| The | which | teacher?  
Which teacher?  
---  
  

Here, the second speaker does not understand the referent of the sumti _le ctuca_ , and so echoes back the sumti with the confusion marker.
The metalinguistic negation cmavo __na'i__ and its opposite __jo'a__ are explained in full in Chapter 15. In general, __na'i__ indicates that there is something wrong with a piece of discourse: either an error, or a false underlying assumption, or something else of the sort. The discourse is invalid or inappropriate due to the marked word or construct.
Similarly, __jo'a__ marks something which looks wrong but is in fact correct. These two cmavo constitute a scale, but are kept apart for two reasons: _na'inai_ means the same as __jo'a__ , but would be too confusing as an affirmation; _jo'anai_ means the same as __na'i__ , but is too long to serve as a convenient metalinguistic negator.
The next two cmavo are used to assist in quoting texts written or spoken by others. It is often the case that we wish to quote only part of a text, or to supply additional material either by way of commentary or to make a fragmentary text grammatical. The cmavo __li'o__ serves the former function. It indicates that words were omitted from the quotation. What remains of the quotation must be grammatical, however, as __li'o__ does not serve any grammatical function. It cannot, for example, take the place of a missing selbri in a bridi, or supply the missing tail of a description sumti: _le li'o_ in isolation is not grammatical.
The cmavo __sa'a__ indicates in a quotation that the marked word or construct was not actually expressed, but is inserted for editorial, narrative, or grammatical purposes. Strictly, even a __li'o__ should appear in the form _li'osa'a_ , since the __li'o__ was not part of the original quotation. In practice, this and other forms which are already associated with metalinguistic expressions, such as __sei__ (of selma'o SEI) or __to'i__ (of selma'o TO) need not be marked except where confusion might result.
In the rare case that the quoted material already contains one or more instances of __sa'a__ , they can be changed to _sa'asa'a_.
The cmavo __xu__ marks truth questions, which are discussed in detail in Section 15.8. In general, __xu__ may be translated “Is it true that ... ?” and questions whether the attached bridi is true. When __xu__ is attached to a specific word or construct, it directs the focus of the question to that word or construct.
Lojban question words, unlike those of English, frequently do not stand at the beginning of the question. Placing the cmavo __pau__ at the beginning of a bridi helps the listener realize that the bridi is a question, like the symbol at the beginning of written Spanish questions that looks like an upside-down question mark. The listener is then warned to watch for the actual question word.
Although __pau__ is grammatical in any location (like all indicators), it is not really useful except at or near the beginning of a bridi. Its scalar opposite, __paunai__ , signals that a bridi is not really a question despite its form. This is what we call in English a rhetorical question: an example appears in the English text near the beginning of Section 13.11.
The cmavo __pe'a__ is the indicator of figurative speech, indicating that the previous word should be taken figuratively rather than literally:
**Example 13.91. **
mi | viska | le | blanu | pe'a | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | blue | [figurative] | house.  
I see the “blue” house.  
---  
  

Here the house is not blue in the sense of color, but in some other sense, whose meaning is entirely culturally dependent. The use of __pe'a__ unambiguously marks a cultural reference: __blanu__ in Example 13.91 could mean “sad” (as in English) or something completely different.
The negated form, _pe'anai_ , indicates that what has been said is to be interpreted literally, in the usual way for Lojban; natural-language intuition is to be ignored.
Alone among the cmavo of selma'o UI, __pe'a__ has a rafsi, namely _pev_. This rafsi is used in forming figurative (culturally dependent) lujvo, whose place structure need have nothing to do with the place structure of the components. Thus _risnyjelca_ (heart burn) might have a place structure like:
> x1 is the heart of x2, burning in atmosphere x3 at temperature x4
whereas _pevrisnyjelca_ , explicitly marked as figurative, might have the place structure:
> x1 is indigestion/heartburn suffered by x2
which obviously has nothing to do with the places of either __risna__ or __jelca__.
The uses of __bi'u__ and __bi'unai__ correspond to one of the uses of the English articles “the” and “a/an”. An English-speaker telling a story may begin with “I saw a man who ...”. Later in the story, the same man will be referred to with the phrase “the man”. Lojban does not use its articles in the same way: both “a man” and “the man” would be translated _le nanmu_ , since the speaker has in mind a specific man. However, the first use might be marked _le bi'u nanmu_ , to indicate that this is a new man, not mentioned before. Later uses could correspondingly be tagged _le bi'unai nanmu_.
Most of the time, the distinction between __bi'u__ and __bi'unai__ need not be made, as the listener can infer the right referent. However, if a different man were referred to still later in the story, _le bi'u nanmu_ would clearly show that this man was different from the previous one.
Finally, the indicator __ge'e__ has been discussed in Section 13.8 and Section 13.10. It is used to express an attitude which is not covered by the existing set, or to avoid expressing any attitude.
Another use for __ge'e__ is to explicitly avoid expressing one's feeling on a given scale; in this use, it functions like a member of selma'o CAI: _.iige'e_ means roughly “I'm not telling whether I'm afraid or not.”
kau |  indirect question  
---|---  
This cmavo is explained in detail in Section 11.8. It marks the word it is attached to as the focus of an indirect question:
**Example 13.92. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | dakau | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of | somebody-[indirect?] | goes | to-the | store.  
I know who goes to the store.

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  
I'm worn out by your continuous talking.  
---  
  

**Example 13.27. **
.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  
I'm putting you to bed.  
---  
  

**Example 13.28. **
.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.  
---  
  

**Example 13.29. **
.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  
I hope I feel better tomorrow!  
---  
  

**Example 13.30. **
.au | mi | sipna  
---|---|---  
[desire] | I | sleep.  
I want to sleep.  
---  
  

**Example 13.31. **
.a'ucu'i | do | pante  
---|---|---  
[no-interest] | you | complain.  
I have no interest in your complaints.  
---  
  

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  
I feel up to dealing with you.  
---  
  

**Example 13.34. **
.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  
I should fill the car's gas tank.  
---  
  

**Example 13.35. **
.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  
---|---|---|---  
[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  
Please take care of yourself!  
---  
  

**Example 13.36. **
.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  
I suggest going to the park.  
---  
  

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  
I can't believe you thought you could fool me.  
---  
  

**Example 13.38. **
do | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  
I blame you for not coming home.  
---  
  

**Example 13.39. **
.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  
le | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  
It's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  
---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  
---
