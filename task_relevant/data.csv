Answer:",It might rain tomorrow.,carvi jai cumki fa lo bavlamdei,jai cumki carvi fa lo bavlamdei,2,,A,"In B, the modificand (tertau) of the main predicate is ""carvi"".

Sentence A is vague but idiomatic: the modificand of the main predicate is ""jai cumki"", where ""jai"" indicates that the surface subject is raised out of the underlying subject, and the entire sentence can be translated as ""Tomorrow is a possibility regarding rain"".",A,"""It might rain"" expresses the possibility that it will rain.

Answer:","I didn't go outside, the reason being that it was raining.",mi na klama lo bartu ki'u lo nu carvi,mi na klama lo bartu .i ki'u bo carvi,6,,B,"In A, the negator ""na"" scopes over the adverbial after it, ""ki'u lo nu carvi"", resulting in an incorrect meaning: ""It is not because it was raining that I went outside"". In B, ""ki'u"" is used as a sentence connective, which takes it out of the scope of ""na"", resulting in the intended meaning.",B,"The negation in (A) has scope over the preposition ""ki'u"" (""because""), yielding ""It is not the case that: it raining is the reason for my going outside"", which is completely wrong.

I was swimming there yesterday.,lo lalxu ca culno lo'e remna .i mi ri limna ca lo prulamdei,lo lalxu ca culno lo'e remna .i mi ru limna ca lo prulamdei,7,,B,"The pronoun ""ri"" refers to the last-started completed argument (skipping over certain pronouns if present).

""ru"", used in B, refers to an earlier argument (one that couldn't be pointed to by ""ri""), resulting in the intended meaning.",B,"The pronoun ""ri"" refers to the most recently uttered argument phrase. In (A), the antecedent is ""lo'e remna"" (""people""), so the second half of (A) means ""I was swimming in people yesterday"".

Exactly one of the answers above is correct. Please indicate the single letter corresponding to the correct answer (A or B).
Answer:",Try to cut the melon.,ko troci co katna lo guzme,ko katna troci lo guzme,7,,A,"Though the predicates ""katna troci"" and ""troci co katna"" mean the same per se, using ""co"" changes not only the order of modifier and modificand, but also the behaviour of arguments in the verb phrase. Without ""co"", they are understood as arguments of the modificand, ""troci"", while with it, they are arguments of the modifier, ""katna"". So, without ""co"", A could be rewritten as ""ko katna be lo guzme be'o troci"". The second argument of ""troci"" is always an action, not a concrete object, so B is nonsensical, while A is a vague but idiomatic translation of the English.",A,"""The final component in a tanru (multiple predicates in a row) determines the place structure.

""katna troci"" (""cut-try"") has the place structure of ""troci"": x1 tries to do x2
Therefore, it is incorrect to follow it with ""lo guzme"" (""the melon""), because that puts it in the second argument place of ""troci"".

Answer:",Do you enjoy riding a bike?,xu lo ka sazri lo'e relxima ku do pluka,xu lo ka sazri lo'e relxima kei do pluka,4,,B,"In A, ""ku"" closes only the argument phrase, ""lo'e relxima ku"", not the abstraction started by ""ka"". This results in ""do"" being interpreted as the third argument of ""sazri"", and ""pluka"" as the modificand of the predicate formed by the abstraction. The sentence is then left without a main predicate. A could be translated as: ""Is it the enjoyable thing related to riding a bike for the purpose of you?"". In B, the abstraction is closed properly, so that both ""do"" and ""pluka"" fall into the outermost sentence, giving the intended meaning.",B,"The intended structure is ""Is [to operate a bike] [to you] [pleasant]?""

Answer:",How many words do you know in Malay?,slabu do fa xo valsi be fi lo meljo,slabu do fa xo valsi be lo meljo,3,,A,"The second place of ""valsi"" takes the meaning of the word, not the language, which goes in the third place.

Exactly one of the answers above is correct. Please indicate the single letter corresponding to the correct answer (A or B).
Answer:",The windows vary in transparency automatically.,lo canko cu zmiku lo ka cenba lo ka guskli,lo canko cu cenba lo ka guskli poi zmiku,7,,A,"Many meanings expressed as adverbs in English are expressed as main verbs in Lojban. A is a correct translation of the English: ""The windows are automatic in varying their transparency"". In B, the relative clause ""poi zmiku"" is part of the argument phrase, ""lo ka guskli poi zmiku"", meaning ""the transparency that is automatic"". Standard Lojban has no sentence-level relative clauses.",A,"Adverbs like ""automatically"" often have to be turned into verbs in Lojban, such as in (A), where ""zmiku"" is the main verb (""x1 automatically satisfies property x2"") and we get ""The window automatically varies in transparency.""

(B) instead attaches ""zmiku"" to ""lo ka guskli"" (""the property of being transparent"") using a restrictive relative clause, which means something like ""the property of being transparent that is automatic"", but this is the wrong approach.",1,,0

The intended plural meaning can be expressed with the unofficial plural quantifier ""su'oi"" or, as in A, with the equivalent predicate ""kancusu'oi"".",A,"In standard Lojban, where ""su'o"" is a singular quantifier, (B) is wrong.

(A) ti botpi fo zi'o
(B) ti botpi fo zi'o .e no da

Exactly one of the answers above is correct. Please indicate the single letter corresponding to the correct answer (A or B).
Answer:",This is a bottle without a lid.,ti botpi fo zi'o,ti botpi fo zi'o .e no da,7,,B,"Removing an argument place with ""zi'o"" does not automatically assert that the original predicate doesn't apply; it makes an implicature at best. To say that only the lower-arity predicate applies, the original one must be explicitly negated, such as with ""no da"" in B.",B,"The classic ""a bottle without a lid is not a bottle in Lojban"". The place structure of ""botpi"" is ""x1 is a bottle for x2, made of material x3 with lid x4"".

By placing the argument ""no da"" (""nothing""), which is equivalent to ""na ku su'o da"" (""not anything""), the entire relationship is negated, meaning the claim is that the thing is not a bottle, which is too strong a claim.

The pronoun ""zi'o"" can be used to remove places from the place structure. The place structure of ""botpi fo zi'o"" is then ""x1 is a bottle for x2, made of material x3"", where the old ""lid"" place is no longer present. This new predicate can be used to state positively that the object under discussion is a bottle (without stating whether it has a lid or not), and combined with the "".e no da"" (""and nothing""), the existence of a corresponding lid is negated.

Therefore, the unusual (B) is correct.",1,,0

In A, the containing argument phrase is terminated with ""ku"", giving the intended meaning.",A,"(B) means ""He fears [[when something is loud] and [bored by silence]]"" because the subclause opened by the first ""nu"" is not closed, which can be achieved via ""ku"" as in (A) or more commonly via ""kei"".

Exactly one of the answers above is correct. Please indicate the single letter corresponding to the correct answer (A or B).
Answer:",Everybody here is sick.,ro da pe bu'u ti bilma,ro da bu'u ti bilma,6,,A,"B, depending on context, could mean either that everyone is here and sick, or that everyone is sick when they are here. This is because the quantifier ""ro"" scopes over the prepositional phrase ""bu'u ti"", which is a separate term here. (The former could be specified using a tense marker such as ""ca"", the latter by rewording the sentence to reify the two events of being here and being sick.) In A, ""bu'u ti"" is made to restrict the quantified variable using ""pe"", giving the intended meaning. The English ""everybody here"" has essentially the same structure as ""ro da pe bu'u ti"" except that there is no overt relativiser.",A,"This is a claim about ""everybody [who is] here"", which is exactly what ""ro da pe bu'u ti"" expresses.

In A, ""lo mamta be do"" is an argument of ""lebna"" but not of ""dunda"", which is not wrong per se, as it leaves the argument of ""dunda"" to context. In B, the ""vau"" closes the inner verb phrase, such that ""lo mamta be do"" falls into the outer one and applies to both verbs, which better reflects the intended meaning.",B,"In order for the argument ""lo mamta be do"" (""your mother"") to be shared by both bridi-tails, the terminator ""vau"" has to be inserted before it.

(A) frili fa ge tu'a lo vorme gi nai ku'i tu'a lo canko
(B) frili fa tu'a lo vorme .e nai lo canko ku ku'i

Exactly one of the answers above is correct. Please indicate the single letter corresponding to the correct answer (A or B).
Answer:","The door is easy, but the window isn't.",frili fa ge tu'a lo vorme gi nai ku'i tu'a lo canko,frili fa tu'a lo vorme .e nai lo canko ku ku'i,5,19,A,"A ""tu'a"" phrase refers to an abstraction (such as a property), and connectives and quantifiers within the phrase are interpreted as if they were in a subsentence describing that property. Thus, sentence B does not compare two actions that might or might not be easy, but rather declares one thing as easy, namely doing something clear from context to the door and not the window. On the other hand, sentence A connects two separate ""tu'a"" phrases, which results in a meaning faithful to the English sentence.",A,"""tu'a"" is used when a concrete noun is used in place of a subclause. ""The door is easy"" means ""Opening the door is easy"", but instead of expressing this explicitly as ""frili fa lo ka kargau lo vorme"", you can say ""frili fa tu'a lo vorme"" (""[something involving] the door is easy"").

In the present example, there is a door and a window under discussion, but we don't want to claim that ""it is easy [to open the door and not the window]"". Instead, we want to claim ""[something involving] the door is easy, but [something involving] the window is not easy"". This requires two ""tu'a"".

(B) combines both the door and the window under a single ""tu'a"", which means ""It is easy [to open the door and not the window].

(A) separates the door and the window under separate ""tu'a"", giving ""[Something involving] the door is easy, but [something involving] the window is not easy.""",1,,0

Answer:",Do you have pet rats again?,xu do su'o ratcu di'a kurji,xu do di'a kurji su'o ratcu,6,20,B,"Quantifiers and similar operators in a sentence interact with each other, with operators on the left scoping over operators to the right of them.

Sentence B, meaning ""Is it again the case that you care for some rats?"", matches the English.",B,"Here, the relative order of the existential quantifier ""su'o"" and the resumptive aspect ""di'a"" is the decisive factor.

By putting ""su'o"" first, like in (A), we get ""Does there exist a rat such that you are taking care of it again?"".

In A, ""ki'u"" is used as a sentence connective, which takes it out of the scope of ""nu'o"", resulting in the intended meaning.",A,"(A) and (B) differ in the relative scope of the tense ""nu'o"" (""haven't yet"") and the preposition ""ki'u"" (""because"").

To get the intended meaning, ""ki'u"" has to scope over ""nu'o"". This can be achieved by placing ""ki'u"" to the left of ""nu'o"", or by starting a new sentence with "".i ki'u bo"", which is what (A) does.

Answer:",It's common to fight with one's parents.,zilfadni fa lo ka ce'u damba lo rirni be ri,zilfadni fa lo ka ce'u damba lo rirni be ce'u,7,35,A,"The lambda pronoun ""ce'u"" creates a new variable every time it is used. To use the same variable again, it must be assigned to another pronoun, such as the automatically assigned ""ri"" used in A. B, where the repeated ""ce'u"" results in a second variable, is nonsensical because ""zilfadni"" expects a unary predicate in its first place.",A,"The predicate ""zilfadni"" (""common"") takes a property as its first argument, in other words, a ka-clause with exactly one ""ce'u"". 

In a property clause (""ka""), every occurence of ""ce'u"" stands for a new lambda variable instead of referring to the same variable.

Answer:",The clown's nose is red.,lo .ekcala be lo nazbi cu xunre,lo nazbi be lo .ekcala cu xunre,7,34,B,"The particle ""be"" curries the argument after it into the predicate before it. ""lo nazbi be lo .ekcala"" means ""the nose of the clown"", while ""lo .ekcala be lo nazbi"" is nonsensical because "".ekcala"" takes only one argument.",B,"""lo .ekcala be lo nazbi"" is ill-formed because it places ""lo nazbi"" (""the nose"") into the second argument place of "".ekcala"" (""clown""), which doesn't exist (it would mean ""that which clowns the nose"" or so).

In B, "".e'a"" attaches to ""pinfu"" in the vocative phrase, which could be interpreted as, ""hey, those who I permit to be prisoners"". In A, "".e'a"" is attached correctly to ""sipna"": ""sleep, I permit"".",A,"Attitudinals such as "".e'a"" attach to the word on their left. Their placement has a big impact on the meaning of a sentence. The word "".e'a"" expresses permission, and what is permitted is the word that it is attached to.

In (A), "".e'a"" is attached to ""sipna"" (""sleep""), meaning to sleep is what is permitted.

Answer:","Around noon, the squirrel started to dig.",ki lo dormidju zi co'a kakpa fa lo ricyratcu,zi lo dormidju co'a kakpa fa lo ricyratcu,7,43,A,"When used as a preposition, ""zi"" takes the length of time as an argument, not the point from which the time is reckoned. This point can be given using ""ki"", as in A.",A,"When used as a preposition, ""zi"" (""soon"") should be followed by an argument that expresses the temporal distance to the main event, and not a point in time like ""noon"".

In order to specify the reference point of ""zi"" (i.e. to specify what the main event is temporally close to) the word ""ki"" should be used, as in (A).

Answer:","Please, this is important!",pe'u ti vajni,ti vajni pe'u,4,48,B,"Vocatives like ""pe'u"" take a following argument, such as ""mi"", to specify who the speaker is talking to. So, A translates as ""Please, this! It is important."", while B, where ""pe'u"" has no argument after it, matches the English. Another way to ensure that ""mi"" is an argument of the main predicate instead of the vocative would be to close the latter with the terminator ""do'u"": ""pe'u do'u ti vajni"".",B,"When a word follows ""pe'u"" (""please""), it specifies the addressee.

Answer:",Eleven divided by five is two and one-fifth.,li pa pa fe'i mu du li re su'i vei pa fe'i mu,li pa pa fe'i mu du li re su'i pa fe'i mu,4,67,A,"Lojban does not use the standard grouping rules of mathematical notation. Officially, sequences of operators without explicit grouping, such as in A, are ambiguous; in practice, they are left-grouping like many other constructs in the language, so B would be understood as ""11 / 5 = (2 + 1) / 5"".
