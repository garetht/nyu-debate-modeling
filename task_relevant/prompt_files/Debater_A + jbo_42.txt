Answer:=== SYSTEM PROMPT ===
The following are rules from the game of Debate.
- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.
- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.
- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.
- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.
- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.
- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.
You are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. 
  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.
  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. 
  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.

## 11.5. Amount abstractions
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
ni |  NU |  amount abstraction  
---|---|---  
Amount abstractions are far more limited than event or property abstractions. They really make sense only if the selbri of the abstracted bridi is subject to measurement of some sort. Thus we can speak of:
**Example 11.34. **
le | ni | le | pixra | cu | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | amount-of | (the | picture |  | being-blue | )  
the amount of blueness in the picture  
---  
  

because “blueness” could be measured with a colorimeter or a similar device. However,
**Example 11.35. **
le | ni | la | djein. | cu | mamta | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | amount-of | (that-named | Jane |  | being-a-mother | )  
the amount of Jane's mother-ness (?)  
---  
the amount of mother-ness in Jane (?)  
  

makes very little sense in either Lojban or English. We simply do not have any sort of measurement scale for being a mother.
Semantically, a sumti with _le ni_ is a number; however, it cannot be treated grammatically as a quantifier in Lojban unless prefixed by the mathematical cmavo __mo'e__ :
**Example 11.36. **
li | pa | vu'u | mo'e | le | ni |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 1 | minus | the-operand | the | amount-of | (  
le | pixra | cu | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | picture |  | being-blue | )  
1 - B, where `B` = blueness of the picture  
---  
  

Mathematical Lojban is beyond the scope of this chapter, and is explained more fully in Chapter 18.
There are contexts where either property or amount abstractions make sense, and in such constructions, amount abstractions can make use of __ce'u__ just like property abstractors. Thus,
**Example 11.37. **
le | pixra | cu | cenba | le | ka | ce'u | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | picture |  | varies | in-the | property-of | (X | is blue | ).  
The picture varies in being blue.  
---  
The picture varies in blueness.  
  

is not the same as
**Example 11.38. **
le | pixra | cu | cenba | le | ni | ce'u | blanu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | picture |  | varies | in-the | amount-of | (X | is blue | ).  
The picture varies in how blue it is.  
---  
The picture varies in blueness.  
  

Example 11.37 conveys that the blueness comes and goes, whereas Example 11.38 conveys that its quantity changes over time.
Whenever we talk of measurement of an amount, there is some sort of scale, and so the place structure of __ni__ abstraction selbri is:
> _ _ni_ _ x1 is the amount of (the bridi) on scale x2
Note: the best way to express the x2 places of abstract sumti is to use something like _le ni ... kei be_. See Example 11.62 for the use of this construction.

## 11.7. Predication/sentence abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
du'u |  NU |  predication abstraction  
---|---|---  
There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:
**Example 11.42. **
I know that Frank is a fool.
  

How's that in Lojban? Let us try:
**Example 11.43. **
mi | djuno | le | nu | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the event of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can't be contained inside one's mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; Example 11.43 comes close to claiming that Frank's being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, Example 11.43 is an instance of improperly marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in Section 11.10).
Try again:
**Example 11.44. **
mi | djuno | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Closer. Example 11.44 says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn't say that he is one, as Example 11.42 does. To catch that nuance, we must say:
**Example 11.45. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the predication that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a fool” is not a property of _le du'u_ abstraction, but of __djuno__ ; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, __djuno__ like __jei__ has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) Example 11.46 has no such implied assertion:
**Example 11.46. **
mi | kucli | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

and here __du'u__ could probably be replaced by __jei__ without much change in meaning:
**Example 11.47. **
mi | kucli | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about how true it is that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, __du'u__ has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:
> _ _du'u_ _ x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2
and _le se du'u ..._ is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:
**Example 11.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | le | se du'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses | the | (sentence-expressing-that  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes-to | the | store | )  
John says that George goes to the store.  
---  
  

Example 11.48 differs from
**Example 11.49. **
la | djan | cusku | lu  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses, | quote,  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes | to-the | store, | unquote.  
John says “George goes to the store”.  
---  
  

because Example 11.49 claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas Example 11.48 claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.
_le se du'u_ is much the same as _lu'e le du'u_ , a symbol for the predication, but _se du'u_ can be used as a selbri, whereas __lu'e__ is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See Section 6.10 for a discussion of __lu'e__.)

# Chapter 11. Events, Qualities, Quantities, And Other Vague Words: On Lojban Abstraction
## 11.1. The syntax of abstraction
The purpose of the feature of Lojban known as “abstraction” is to provide a means for taking whole bridi and packaging them up, as it were, into simple selbri. Syntactically, abstractions are very simple and uniform; semantically, they are rich and complex, with few features in common between one variety of abstraction and another. We will begin by discussing syntax without regard to semantics; as a result, the notion of abstraction may seem unmotivated at first. Bear with this difficulty until Section 11.2.
An abstraction selbri is formed by taking a full bridi and preceding it by any cmavo of selma'o NU. There are twelve such cmavo; they are known as “abstractors”. The bridi is closed by the elidable terminator __kei__ , of selma'o KEI. Thus, to change the bridi
**Example 11.1. **
mi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store  
  

into an abstraction using __nu__ , one of the members of selma'o NU, we change it into
**Example 11.2. **
nu | mi | klama | le | zarci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
an-event-of | my | going-to | the | store  
  

The bridi may be a simple selbri, or it may have associated sumti, as here. It is important to beware of eliding __kei__ improperly, as many of the common uses of abstraction selbri involve following them with words that would appear to be part of the abstraction if __kei__ had been elided.
(Technically, __kei__ is never necessary, because the elidable terminator __vau__ that closes every bridi can substitute for it; however, __kei__ is specific to abstractions, and using it is almost always clearer.)
The grammatical uses of an abstraction selbri are exactly the same as those of a simple brivla. In particular, abstraction selbri may be used as observatives, as in Example 11.2, or used in tanru:
**Example 11.3. **
la | djan. |  | cu | nu | sonci | kei |  | djica  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | is-an |  | (event-of | being-a-soldier | ) | type-of | desirer.  
John wants to be a soldier.  
---  
  

Abstraction selbri may also be used in descriptions, preceded by __le__ (or any other member of selma'o LE):
**Example 11.4. **
la | djan. | cu | djica | le | nu | sonci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | desires | the | event-of | being-a-soldier.  
  

We will most often use descriptions containing abstraction either at the end of a bridi, or just before the main selbri with its __cu__ ; in either of these circumstances, __kei__ can normally be elided.
The place structure of an abstraction selbri depends on the particular abstractor, and will be explained individually in the following sections.
Note: In glosses of bridi within abstractions, the grammatical form used in the English changes. Thus, in the gloss of Example 11.2 we see “my going-to the store” rather than “I go-to the store”; likewise, in the glosses of Example 11.3 and Example 11.4 we see “being-a-soldier” rather than “is-a-soldier”. This procedure reflects the desire for more understandable glosses, and does not indicate any change in the Lojban form. A bridi is a bridi, and undergoes no change when it is used as part of an abstraction selbri.

## 19.4. Topic-comment sentences: ZOhU
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
zo'u |  ZOhU |  topic/comment separator  
---|---|---  
The normal Lojban sentence is just a bridi, parallel to the normal English sentence which has a subject and a predicate:
**Example 19.2. **
mi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I went-to the market  
---  
  

In Chinese, the normal sentence form is different: a topic is stated, and a comment about it is made. (Japanese also has the concept of a topic, but indicates it by attaching a suffix; other languages also distinguish topics in various ways.) The topic says what the sentence is about:
**Example 19.3. **
  * zhe4 xiao1xi2 : wo3 zhi1dao le 
  * this news : I know [perfective]
  * As for this news, I knew it.
  * I've heard this news already.


  

The colon in the first two versions of Example 19.3 separate the topic (“this news”) from the comment (“I know already”).
Lojban uses the cmavo __zo'u__ (of selma'o ZOhU) to separate topic (a sumti) from comment (a bridi):
**Example 19.4. **
le | nuzba | zo'u | mi | ba'o | djuno  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | news | : | I | [perfective] | know.  
  

Example 19.4 is the literal Lojban translation of Example 19.3. Of course, the topic-comment structure can be changed to a straightforward bridi structure:
**Example 19.5. **
mi | ba'o | djuno | le | nuzba  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [perfective] | know | the | news.  
  

Example 19.5 means the same as Example 19.4, and it is simpler. However, often the position of the topic in the place structure of the selbri within the comment is vague:
**Example 19.6. **
le | finpe | zo'u | citka  
---|---|---|---  
the | fish | : | eat  
  

Is the fish eating or being eaten? The sentence doesn't say. The Chinese equivalent of Example 19.6 is:
**Example 19.7. **
  * yu2: chi1
  * fish: eat


  

which is vague in exactly the same way.
Grammatically, it is possible to have more than one sumti before __zo'u__. This is not normally useful in topic-comment sentences, but is necessary in the other use of __zo'u__ : to separate a quantifying section from a bridi containing quantified variables. This usage belongs to a discussion of quantifier logic in Lojban (see Section 16.2), but an example would be:
**Example 19.8. **
ro | da | poi | prenu | ku'o  
---|---|---|---|---  
For-all | X | which | are-persons, |   
su'o | de | zo'u | de | patfu | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-exists-a | Y | such-that | Y | is-the-father-of | X.  
Every person has a father.  
---  
  

The string of sumti before __zo'u__ (called the “prenex”: see Section 16.2) may contain both a topic and bound variables:
**Example 19.9. **
loi | patfu | ro | da | poi | prenu | ku'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
For-the-mass-of | fathers | for-all | X | which | are-persons, |   
su'o | de | zo'u | de | patfu | da  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
there-exists-a | Y | such-that | Y | is-the-father-of | X.  
As for fathers, every person has one.  
---  
  

To specify a topic which affects more than one sentence, wrap the sentences in __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ brackets and place the topic and the __zo'u__ directly in front. This is the exception to the rule that a topic attaches directly to a sentence:
**Example 19.10. **
loi | jdini | zo'u | tu'e |  | do | ponse | .inaja | do | djica | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-mass-of | money | : | ( | [if] | you | possess, | then | you | want | )  
Money: if you have it, you want it.  
---  
  

Note: In Lojban, you do not “want money”; you “want to have money” or something of the sort, as the x2 place of __djica__ demands an event. As a result, the straightforward rendering of Example 19.9 without a topic is not:
**Example 19.11. **
do | ponse | loi jdini | .inaja | do | djica | ri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | possess | money | only-if | you | desire | its-mere-existence.  
  

where __ri__ means _loi jdini_ and is interpreted as “the mere existence of money”, but rather:
**Example 19.12. **
do | ponse | loi jdini | .inaja | do | djica | tu'a | ri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | possess | money | only-if | you | desire | something-about | it.  
  

namely, the possession of money. But topic-comment sentences like Example 19.10 are inherently vague, and this difference between __ponse__ (which expects a physical object in x2) and __djica__ is ignored. See Example 19.45 for another topic/comment sentence.
The subject of an English sentence is often the topic as well, but in Lojban the sumti in the x1 place is not necessarily the topic, especially if it is the normal (unconverted) x1 for the selbri. Thus Lojban sentences don't necessarily have a “subject” in the English sense.

## 14.7. More than two propositions
So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.
Of the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,
**Example 14.31. **
mi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,
**Example 14.32. **
mi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that one or more of the component sentences is true.
O, however, is different. Working out the truth table for
**Example 14.33. **
mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  
  

shows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:
> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.
Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.
In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.
There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: 
**Example 14.34. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  
.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

Does this mean:
**Example 14.35. **
I like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.
  

Or is the correct translation:
**Example 14.36. **
Either I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.
  

Example 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:
**Example 14.37. **
ga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | I | like | that-named | Martha)  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas
**Example 14.38. **
ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary).  
  

is not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.

## 14.8. Grouping of afterthought connectives
There are several ways in Lojban to render Example 14.35 using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo __bo__ (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with __bo__ are interpreted before connections not so marked. Example 14.39 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.38:
**Example 14.39. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John, | and | I | like | that-named | Martha  
.ijabo | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by __.i__ __ja__ first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by __.i__ __je__.
Eks can have __bo__ attached in exactly the same way, so that Example 14.40 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39:
**Example 14.40. **
mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with __bo__ , for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.
What happens if __bo__ is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in Example 14.41?
**Example 14.41. **
mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Does this wind up meaning the same as Example 14.34 and Example 14.36? Not at all. A second rule relating to __bo__ is that where several __bo__ -marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, Example 14.41 in fact means the same as Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with __bo__ should be avoided.
The use of __bo__ , therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of Example 14.37 and Example 14.38, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ are used with ijeks, and __ke__ and __ke'e__ with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (__ke__ and __ke'e__ are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.42. **
I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
  

where the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express Example 14.42 in afterthought, we can say:
**Example 14.43. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije[bo] | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me,  
.ijanai | mi | prami | do | .ijebo | do | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | I | love | you | and | you | love | me.  
  

marking two of the ijeks with __bo__ for high precedence. (The first __bo__ is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)
But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:
**Example 14.44. **
tu'e | mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me | )  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

where the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ pairs set off the structure. The cmavo __tu'u__ is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in Example 14.44 is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.
In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to __bo__ grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.
Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:
**Example 14.45. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider
**Example 14.46. **
I walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.
  

Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to Example 14.44, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with __ke__ , so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing Example 14.47, which is instead parallel to Example 14.45:
**Example 14.47. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | the | house  
.a | ke | le | ckule | .e | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | the | school | and | the | office | ).  
  

If sumti were allowed to begin with __ke__ , unavoidable ambiguities would result, so __ke__ grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to __tu'e__ grouping of bridi, as Example 14.44 shows.
Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of Example 14.33: “I am German, rich, and a man – or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:
**Example 14.48. **
[tu'e] | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-rich | )  
.ije | tu'e | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | nanmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | ( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-a-man | ).  
  

The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.

## 15.7. Negation of minor grammatical constructs
We have a few other constructs that can be negated, all of them based on negating individual words. For such negation, we use the suffix-combining negator, which is __nai__. __nai__ , by the way, is almost always written as a compound into the previous word that it is negating, although it is a regular separate-word cmavo and the sole member of selma'o NAI.
Most of these negation forms are straightforward, and should be discussed and interpreted in connection with an analysis of the particular construct being negated. Thus, we will not go into much detail here.
The following are places where __nai__ is used:
When attached to tenses and modals (see Section 9.13, Section 10.9, Section 10.18 and Section 10.20), the __nai__ suffix usually indicates a contradictory negation of the tagged bridi. Thus _punai_ as a tense inflection means “not-in-the-past”, or “not-previously”, without making any implication about any other time period unless explicitly stated. As a result,
**Example 15.77. **
mi | na | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [false] | [past] | go-to | the | store.  
I didn't go to the store.  
---  
  

and
**Example 15.78. **
mi | punai | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past-not] | go-to | the | store.  
I didn't go to the store.  
---  
  

mean exactly the same thing, although there may be a difference of emphasis.
Tenses and modals can be logically connected, with the logical connectives containing contradictory negations; this allows negated tenses and modals to be expressed positively using logical connectives. Thus _punai je ca_ means the same thing as _pu naje ca_.
As a special case, a _-nai_ attached to the interval modifiers of selma'o TAhE, ROI, or ZAhO (explained in Chapter 10) signals a scalar negation:
**Example 15.79. **
mi | paroinai | dansu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [once]-[not] | dance-on | the | ice  
  

means that I dance on the ice either zero or else two or more times within the relevant time interval described by the bridi. Example 15.79 is very different from the English use of “not once”, which is an emphatic way of saying “never” – that is, exactly zero times.
In indicators and attitudinals of selma'o UI or CAI, __nai__ denotes a polar negation. As discussed in Section 13.4, most indicators have an implicit scale, and __nai__ changes the indicator to refer to the opposite end of the scale. Thus __.uinai__ expresses unhappiness, and __.ienai__ expresses disagreement (not ambivalence, which is expressed with the neutral or undecided intensity as _.iecu'i_).
Vocative cmavo of selma'o COI are considered a kind of indicator, but one which identifies the listener. Semantically, we could dispense with about half of the COI selma'o words based on the scalar paradigm. For example, __co'o__ could be expressed as _coinai_. However, this is not generally done.
Most of the COI cmavo are used in what are commonly called protocol situations. These protocols are used, for example, in radio conversations, which often take place in a noisy environment. The negatives of protocol words tend to convey diametrically opposite communications situations (as might be expected). Therefore, only one protocol vocative is dependent on __nai__ : negative acknowledgement, which is __je'enai__ (“I didn't get that”).
Unlike the attitudinal indicators, which tend to be unimportant in noisy situations, the protocol vocatives become more important. So if, in a noisy environment, a protocol listener makes out only __nai__ , he or she can presume it is a negative acknowledgement and repeat transmission or otherwise respond accordingly. Section 13.14 provides more detail on this topic.
The abstractors of selma'o NU follow the pattern of the tenses and modals. NU allows negative abstractions, especially in compound abstractions connected by logical connectives: _su'ujeninai_ , which corresponds to _su'u jenai ni_ just as _punai je ca_ corresponds to _pu naje ca_. It is not clear how much use logically connected abstractors will be: see Section 11.12.
A __nai__ attached to a non-logical connective (of selma'o JOI or BIhI) is a scalar negation, and says that the bridi is false under the specified mixture, but that another connective is applicable. Non-logical connectives are discussed in Section 14.14.

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.

## 14.16. Interval connectives and forethought non-logical connection
In addition to the non-logical connectives of selma'o JOI explained in Section 14.14 and Section 14.15, there are three other connectives which can appear in joiks: __bi'i__ , __bi'o__ , and __mi'i__ , all of selma'o BIhI. The first two cmavo are used to specify intervals: abstract objects defined by two endpoints. The cmavo __bi'i__ is correct if the endpoints are independent of order, whereas __bi'o__ or __se__ __bi'o__ are used when order matters.
An example of __bi'i__ in sumti connection:
**Example 14.138. **
mi | ca | sanli  
---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand-on-surface  
la | drezdn. | bi'i | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Dresden | [interval] | that-named | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt.  
---  
  

In Example 14.138, it is all the same whether I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt or between Frankfurt and Dresden, so __bi'i__ is the appropriate interval connective. The sumti _la drezdn. bi'i la frankfurt._ falls into the x2 place of __sanli__ , which is the surface I stand on; the interval specifies that surface by its limits. (Obviously, I am not standing on the whole of the interval; the x2 place of __sanli__ specifies a surface which is typically larger in extent than just the size of the stander's feet.)
**Example 14.139. **
mi | cadzu | ca | la | pacac.  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk | simultaneous-with |  | First-hour  
bi'o | la | recac.  
---|---|---  
[ordered-interval] |  | Second-hour.  
I walk from one o'clock to two o'clock.  
---  
  

In Example 14.139, on the other hand, it is essential that _la pacac._ comes before _la recac._ ; otherwise we have an 11-hour (or 23-hour) interval rather than a one-hour interval. In this use of an interval, the whole interval is probably intended, or at least most of it.
Example 14.139 is equivalent to:
**Example 14.140. **
mi | cadzu | ca | la | recac.  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk | simultaneous-with |  | Second-hour  
se | bi'o | la | pacac.  
---|---|---|---  
[reverse] | [ordered] |  | First-hour.  
  

English cannot readily express __se__ __bi'o__ , but its meaning can be understood by reversing the two sumti.
The third cmavo of selma'o BIhI, namely __mi'i__ , expresses an interval seen from a different viewpoint: not a pair of endpoints, but a center point and a distance. For example:
**Example 14.141. **
le | jbama | pu | daspo | la | .uacintyn.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | bomb | [past] | destroys |  | Washington  
mi'i | lo | minli | be | li | muno  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[center] | what-is | measured-in-miles |  | by | 50.  
The bomb destroyed Washington and fifty miles around.  
---  
  

Here we have an interval whose center is Washington and whose distance, or radius, is fifty miles.
In Example 14.138, is it possible that I am standing in Dresden (or Frankfurt) itself? Yes. The connectives of selma'o BIhI are ambiguous about whether the endpoints themselves are included in or excluded from the interval. Two auxiliary cmavo __ga'o__ and __ke'i__ (of cmavo GAhO) are used to indicate the status of the endpoints: __ga'o__ means that the endpoint is included, __ke'i__ that it is excluded:
**Example 14.142. **
mi | ca | sanli | la | drezdn. | ga'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand | that-named | Dresden | [inclusive]  
bi'i | ga'o | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---  
[interval] | [inclusive] | that-named | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt, inclusive of both.  
---  
  

**Example 14.143. **
mi | ca | sanli | la | drezdn. | ga'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand | that-named | Dresden | [inclusive]  
bi'i | ke'i | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---  
[interval] | [exclusive] | that-named | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden (inclusive) and Frankfurt (exclusive).  
---  
  

**Example 14.144. **
mi | ca | sanli | la | drezdn. | ke'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand | that-named | Dresden | [exclusive]  
bi'i | ga'o | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---  
[interval] | [inclusive] | that-named | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden (exclusive) and Frankfurt (inclusive).  
---  
  

**Example 14.145. **
mi | ca | sanli | la | drezdn. | ke'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand | that-named | Dresden | [exclusive]  
bi'i | ke'i | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---  
[interval] | [exclusive] | that-named | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt, exclusive of both.  
---  
  

As these examples should make clear, the GAhO cmavo that applies to a given endpoint is the one that stands physically adjacent to it: the left-hand endpoint is referred to by the first GAhO, and the right-hand endpoint by the second GAhO. It is ungrammatical to have just one GAhO.
(Etymologically, __ga'o__ is derived from __ganlo__ , which means “closed”, and __ke'i__ from __kalri__ , which means “open”. In mathematics, inclusive intervals are referred to as closed intervals, and exclusive intervals as open ones.)
BIhI joiks are grammatical anywhere that other joiks are, including in tanru connection and (as ijoiks) between sentences. No meanings have been found for these uses.
Negated intervals, marked with a _-nai_ following the BIhI cmavo, indicate an interval that includes everything but what is between the endpoints (with respect to some understood scale):
**Example 14.146. **
do | dicra | .e'a | mi | ca | la | daucac.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | disturb | (allowed) | me | at | that-named | 10  
bi'onai | la | gaicac.  
---|---|---  
not-from-...-to | that-named | 12  
You can contact me except from 10 to 12.  
---  
  

The complete syntax of joiks is: 
>   * [se] JOI [nai] 
>   * [se] BIhI [nai] 
>   * GAhO [se] BIhI [nai] GAhO 
> 

Notice that the colloquial English translations of __bi'i__ and __bi'o__ have forethought form: “between ... and” for __bi'i__ , and “from ... to” for __bi'o__. In Lojban too, non-logical connectives can be expressed in forethought. Rather than using a separate selma'o, the forethought logical connectives are constructed from the afterthought ones by suffixing __gi__. Such a compound cmavo is not unnaturally called a “joigik”; the syntax of joigiks is any of: 
>   * [se] JOI [nai] GI 
>   * [se] BIhI [nai] GI 
>   * GAhO [se] BIhI [nai] GAhO GI 
> 

Joigiks may be used to non-logically connect bridi, sumti, and bridi-tails; and also in termsets.
Example 14.111 in forethought becomes:
**Example 14.147. **
joigi | la | djan. | gi | la | .alis. | bevri | le | pipno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[Together] | that-named | John | and | that-named | Alice | carry | the | piano.  
  

The first __gi__ is part of the joigik; the second __gi__ is the regular gik that separates the two things being connected in all forethought forms.
Example 14.143 can be expressed in forethought as:
**Example 14.148. **
mi | ca | sanli | ke'i | bi'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand | [exclusive] | between  
ga'o | gi | la | drezdn. | gi | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[inclusive] | and | that-named | Dresden | and | that-named | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden (exclusive) and Frankfurt (inclusive).  
---  
  

In forethought, unfortunately, the GAhOs become physically separated from the endpoints, but the same rule applies: the first GAhO refers to the first endpoint.

## 10.15. Tenses in subordinate bridi
English has a set of rules, formally known as “sequence of tense rules”, for determining what tense should be used in a subordinate clause, depending on the tense used in the main sentence. Here are some examples:
**Example 10.100. **
John says that George is going to the market.
  

**Example 10.101. **
John says that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.102. **
John said that George went to the market.
  

**Example 10.103. **
John said that George had gone to the market.
  

In Example 10.100 and Example 10.101, the tense of the main sentence is the present: “says”. If George goes when John speaks, we get the present tense “is going” (“goes” would be unidiomatic); if George goes before John speaks, we get the past tense “went”. But if the tense of the main sentence is the past, with “said”, then the tense required in the subordinate clause is different. If George goes when John speaks, we get the past tense “went”; if George goes before John speaks, we get the past-perfect tense “had gone”.
The rule of English, therefore, is that both the tense of the main sentence and the tense of the subordinate clause are understood relative to the speaker of the main sentence (not John, but the person who speaks Example 10.100 through Example 10.103).
Lojban, like Russian and Esperanto, uses a different convention. A tense in a subordinate bridi is understood to be relative to the tense already set in the main bridi. Thus Example 10.100 through Example 10.103 can be expressed in Lojban respectively thus:
**Example 10.104. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.105. **
la | djan. | ca | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [present] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.106. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | ca | klama | le | zarci  
That-named | George | [present] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.107. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | goes-to | the | market.  
  

Probably the most counterintuitive of the Lojban examples is Example 10.106. The __ca__ looks quite odd, as if George were going to the market right now, rather than back when John spoke. But this __ca__ is really a __ca__ with respect to a reference point specified by the outer __pu__. This behavior is the same as the additive behavior of multiple tenses in the same bridi, as explained in Section 10.13.
There is a special cmavo __nau__ (of selma'o CUhE) which can be used to override these rules and get to the speaker's current reference point. (Yes, it sounds like English “now”.) It is not grammatical to combine __nau__ with any other cmavo in a tense, except by way of a logical or non-logical connection (see Section 10.20). Here is a convoluted sentence with several nested bridi which uses __nau__ at the lowest level:
**Example 10.108. **
la | djan. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | .alis | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | djordj. | pu | cusku | le | se | du'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [past] | says | the |  | statement-that  
la | maris. | nau | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Mary | [now] | goes-to | the | market.  
John said that Alice had said that George had earlier said that Mary is now going to the market.  
---  
  

The use of __nau__ does not affect sticky tenses.

## 11.2. Event abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
nu |  NU |  event abstractor  
---|---|---  
The examples in Section 11.1 made use of __nu__ as the abstractor, and it is certainly the most common abstractor in Lojban text. Its purpose is to capture the event or state of the bridi considered as a whole. Do not confuse the __le__ description built on a __nu__ abstraction with ordinary descriptions based on __le__ alone. The following sumti are quite distinct:
**Example 11.5. **
le | klama  
---|---  
the comer, that which comes  
---  
  

**Example 11.6. **
le | se | klama  
---|---|---  
the destination  
---  
  

**Example 11.7. **
le | te | klama  
---|---|---  
the origin  
---  
  

**Example 11.8. **
le | ve | klama  
---|---|---  
the route  
---  
  

**Example 11.9. **
le | xe | klama  
---|---|---  
the means of transportation  
---  
  

**Example 11.10. **
le | nu | klama  
---|---|---  
the event of someone coming to somewhere from somewhere by some route using some means  
---  
  

Example 11.5 through Example 11.9 are descriptions that isolate the five individual sumti places of the selbri __klama__. Example 11.10 describes something associated with the bridi as a whole: the event of it.
In Lojban, the term “event” is divorced from its ordinary English sense of something that happens over a short period of time. The description:
**Example 11.11. **
le | nu | mi | vasxu  
---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | my | breathing  
  

is an event which lasts for the whole of my life (under normal circumstances). On the other hand,
**Example 11.12. **
le | nu | la | djan. | cinba | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | that-named | John | kissing | that-named | Jane  
  

is relatively brief by comparison (again, under normal circumstances).
We can see from Example 11.10 through Example 11.12 that ellipsis of sumti is valid in the bridi of abstraction selbri, just as in the main bridi of a sentence. Any sumti may be ellipsized if the listener will be able to figure out from context what the proper value of it is, or else to recognize that the proper value is unimportant. It is extremely common for __nu__ abstractions in descriptions to have the x1 place ellipsized:
**Example 11.13. **
mi | nelci | le | nu | limna  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | the | event-of | swimming.  
I like swimming.  
---  
  

is elliptical, and most probably means:
**Example 11.14. **
mi | nelci | le | nu | mi | limna  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | the | event-of | I | swim.  
  

In the proper context, of course, Example 11.13 could refer to the event of somebody else swimming. Its English equivalent, “I like swimming”, can't be interpreted as “I like Frank's swimming”; this is a fundamental distinction between English and Lojban. In Lojban, an omitted sumti can mean whatever the context indicates that it should mean.
Note that the lack of an explicit NU cmavo in a sumti can sometimes hide an implicit abstraction. In the context of Example 11.14, the appearance of _le se nelci_ (“that which is liked”) is in effect an abstraction:
**Example 11.15. **
le | se nelci | cu | cafne  
---|---|---|---  
The | liked-thing |  | is-frequent.  
The thing which I like happens often.  
---  
  

which in this context means
> My swimming happens often.
Event descriptions with _le nu_ are commonly used to fill the “under conditions...” places, among others, of gismu and lujvo place structures:
**Example 11.16. **
la | lojban. | cu | frili |  | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Lojban |  | is-easy-for | me  
| le | nu | mi | tadni | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
under-conditions | the | event-of | I | study  
Lojban is easy for me when I study.  
---  
  

(The “when” of the English would also be appropriate for a construction involving a Lojban tense, but the Lojban sentence says more than that the studying is concurrent with the ease.)
The place structure of a __nu__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> x1 is an event of (the bridi)

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.
