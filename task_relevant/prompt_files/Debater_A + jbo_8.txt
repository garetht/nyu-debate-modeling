The following are rules from the game of Debate.
- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.
- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.
- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.
- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.
- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.
- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.
You are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. 
  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.
  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. 
  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.

## 9.3. Tagging places: FA
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
fa |  FA |  tags x1 place  
---|---|---  
fe |  FA |  tags x2 place  
fi |  FA |  tags x3 place  
fo |  FA |  tags x4 place  
fu |  FA |  tags x5 place  
fi'a |  FA |  place structure question  
In sentences like Example 9.1, it is easy to get lost and forget which sumti falls in which place, especially if the sumti are more complicated than simple names or descriptions. The place structure tags of selma'o FA may be used to help clarify place structures. The five cmavo __fa__ , __fe__ , __fi__ , __fo__ , and __fu__ may be inserted just before the sumti in the x1 to x5 places respectively:
**Example 9.8. **
fa | mi | cu | klama | fe | la | bastn. | fi | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x1= | I |  | go | x2= | that-named | Boston | x3= | that-named | Atlanta  
fo | le | dargu | fu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
x4= | the | road | x5= | the | car.  
I go to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.8, the tag __fu__ before _le karce_ clarifies that _le karce_ occupies the x5 place of __klama__. The use of __fu__ tells us nothing about the purpose or meaning of the x5 place; it simply says that _le karce_ occupies it.
In Example 9.8, the tags are overkill; they serve only to make Example 9.1 even longer than it is. Here is a better illustration of the use of FA tags for clarification:
**Example 9.9. **
fa | mi | klama | fe | le | zdani | be | mi | be'o | poi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x1= | I | go | x2= | (the | house | of | me) |  | which  
nurma | vau | fi | la | nu,IORK.  
---|---|---|---|---  
is-rural |  | x3= | that-named | New-York.  
  

In Example 9.9, the place structure of __klama__ is as follows:
x1 | agent |  _ _mi_ _  
---|---|---  
x2 | destination |  _le zdani be mi be'o poi nurma vau_  
x3 | origin |  _la nu,IORK._  
x4 | route | (empty)  
x5 | means | (empty)  
The __fi__ tag serves to remind the hearer that what follows is in the x3 place of __klama__ ; after listening to the complex sumti occupying the x2 place, it's easy to get lost.
Of course, once the sumti have been tagged, the order in which they are specified no longer carries the burden of distinguishing the places. Therefore, it is perfectly all right to scramble them into any order desired, and to move the selbri to anywhere in the bridi, even the beginning:
**Example 9.10. **
klama | fa | mi | fi | la | .atlantas. | fu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
go | x1= | I | x3= | that-named | Atlanta | x5= | the | car  
fe | la | bastn. | fo | le | dargu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston | x4= | the | road.  
Go I from Atlanta using the car to Boston via the road.  
---  
  

Note that no __cu__ is permitted before the selbri in Example 9.10, because __cu__ separates the selbri from any preceding sumti, and Example 9.10 has no such sumti.
**Example 9.11. **
fu | le | karce | fo | le | dargu | fi | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x5= | the | car | x4= | the | road | x3= | that-named | Atlanta  
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I  
Using the car, via the road, from Atlanta to Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.11 exhibits the reverse of the standard bridi form seen in Example 9.1 and Example 9.8, but still means exactly the same thing. If the FA tags were left out, however, producing:
**Example 9.12. **
le | karce | le | dargu | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | car | to-the | road | from-that-named | Atlanta  
la | bastn. | cu | klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
via-that-named | Boston |  | goes | using-me.  
The car goes to the road from Atlanta, with Boston as the route, using me as a means of transport.  
---  
  

the meaning would be wholly changed, and in fact nonsensical.
Tagging places with FA cmavo makes it easy not only to reorder the places but also to omit undesirable ones, without any need for __zo'e__ or special rules about the x1 place:
**Example 9.13. **
klama | fi | la | .atlantas. | fe | la | bastn.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A-goer | x3= | that-named | Atlanta | x2= | that-named | Boston  
fu | le | karce  
---|---|---  
x5= | the | car.  
A goer from Atlanta to Boston using the car.  
---  
  

Here the x1 and x4 places are empty, and so no sumti are tagged with __fa__ or __fo__ ; in addition, the x2 and x3 places appear in reverse order.
What if some sumti have FA tags and others do not? The rule is that after a FA-tagged sumti, any sumti following it occupy the places numerically succeeding it, subject to the proviso that an already-filled place is skipped:
**Example 9.14. **
klama | fa | mi | la | bastn. | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go | x1= | I | x2=that-named | Boston | x3=that-named | Atlanta  
le | dargu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---  
x4=the | road | x5=the | car.  
Go I to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.14, the __fa__ causes __mi__ to occupy the x1 place, and then the following untagged sumti occupy in order the x2 through x5 places. This is the mechanism by which Lojban allows placing the selbri first while specifying a sumti for the x1 place.
Here is a more complex (and more confusing) example:
**Example 9.15. **
mi | klama | fi | la | .atlantas. | le | dargu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go | x3= | that-named | Atlanta, | the | road  
fe | la | bastn. | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston, | the | car.  
I go from Atlanta via the road to Boston using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.15, __mi__ occupies the x1 place because it is the first sumti in the sentence (and is before the selbri). The second sumti, _la .atlantas._ , occupies the x3 place by virtue of the tag __fi__ , and _le dargu_ occupies the x4 place as a result of following _la .atlantas._. Finally, _la bastn._ occupies the x2 place because of its tag __fe__ , and _le karce_ skips over the already-occupied x3 and x4 places to land in the x5 place.
Such a convoluted use of tags should probably be avoided except when trying for a literal translation of some English (or other natural-language) sentence; the rules stated here are merely given so that some standard interpretation is possible.
It is grammatically permitted to tag more than one sumti with the same FA cmavo. The effect is that of making more than one claim:
**Example 9.16. **
[fa] | la | rik. | fa | la | djein. | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[x1=] | that-named | Rick | x1= | that-named | Jane | goes-to  
[fe] | le | skina | fe | le | zdani | fe | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[x2=] | the | movie | x2= | the | house | x2= | the | office  
  

may be taken to say that both Rick and Jane go to the movie, the house, and the office, merging six claims into one. More likely, however, it will simply confuse the listener. There are better ways, involving logical connectives (explained in Chapter 14), to say such things in Lojban. In fact, putting more than one sumti into a place is odd enough that it can only be done by explicit FA usage: this is the motivation for the proviso above, that already-occupied places are skipped. In this way, no sumti can be forced into a place already occupied unless it has an explicit FA cmavo tagging it.
The cmavo __fi'a__ also belongs to selma'o FA, and allows Lojban users to ask questions about place structures. A bridi containing __fi'a__ is a question, asking the listener to supply the appropriate other member of FA which will make the bridi a true statement:
**Example 9.17. **
fi'a | do | dunda | [fe] | le | vi | rozgu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[what-place]? | you | give | x2= | the | nearby | rose  
In what way are you involved in the giving of this rose?  
---  
Are you the giver or the receiver of this rose?  
  

In Example 9.17, the speaker uses the selbri __dunda__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _dunda_ _ x1 gives x2 to x3
The tagged sumti _fi'a do_ indicates that the speaker wishes to know whether the sumti __do__ falls in the x1 or the x3 place (the x2 place is already occupied by _le rozgu_). The listener can reply with a sentence consisting solely of a FA cmavo: __fa__ if the listener is the giver, __fi__ if he/she is the receiver.
I have inserted the tag __fe__ in brackets into Example 9.17, but it is actually not necessary, because __fi'a__ does not count as a numeric tag; therefore, _le vi rozgu_ would necessarily be in the x2 place even if no tag were present, because it immediately follows the selbri.
There is also another member of FA, namely __fai__ , which is discussed in Section 9.12.

## 10.22. Conversion of sumti tcita: JAI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
jai |  JAI |  tense conversion  
---|---|---  
fai |  FA |  indefinite place  
Conversion is the regular Lojban process of moving around the places of a place structure. The cmavo of selma'o SE serve this purpose, exchanging the first place with one of the others:
**Example 10.162. **
mi | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | go-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.163. **
le | zarci | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-gone-to | by-me.  
  

It is also possible to bring a place that is specified by a sumti tcita (for the purposes of this chapter, a tense sumti tcita) to the front, by using __jai__ plus the tense as the grammatical equivalent of SE:
**Example 10.164. **
le | ratcu | cu | citka | le | cirla | vi | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | rat |  | eats | the | cheese | [short-distance] | the | park.  
The rat eats the cheese in the park.  
---  
  

**Example 10.165. **
le | panka | cu | jai vi | citka | le | cirla | fai | le | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | park |  | is-the-place-of | eating | the | cheese | by | the | rat.  
The park is where the rat eats the cheese.  
---  
  

In Example 10.165, the construction JAI+tense converts the location sumti into the first place. The previous first place has nowhere to go, since the location sumti is not a numbered place; however, it can be inserted back into the bridi with __fai__ , the indefinite member of selma'o FA.
(The other members of FA are used to mark the first, second, etc. places of a bridi explicitly:
**Example 10.166. **
fa mi cu klama fe le zarci
  

means the same as
**Example 10.167. **
fe le zarci cu klama fa mi
  

as well as the simple
**Example 10.168. **
mi cu klama le zarci
  

in which the place structure is determined by position.)
Like SE conversion, JAI+tense conversion is especially useful in descriptions with LE selma'o:
**Example 10.169. **
mi | viska | le | jai vi | citka | be | le | cirla  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | place-of | eating |  | the | cheese.  
  

Here the eater of the cheese is elided, so no __fai__ appears.
Of course, temporal tenses are also usable with JAI:
**Example 10.170. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | jai | ca | morsi | be | fai | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the |  | [present] | is-dead |  | of | that-named |  “John” | .  
I know the time of John's death.  
---  
I know when John died.

## 6.8. Indefinite descriptions
By a quirk of Lojban syntax, it is possible to omit the descriptor __lo__ , but never any other descriptor, from a description like that of Example 6.42; namely, one which has an explicit outer quantifier but no explicit inner quantifier. The following example:
**Example 6.44. **
ci | gerku | [ku] | cu | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---  
Three-of-those-which-are | dogs |  |  | are-white.  
Three dogs are white.  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 6.42. Even though the descriptor is not present, the elidable terminator __ku__ may still be used. The name “indefinite description” for this syntactic form is historically based: of course, it is no more and no less indefinite than its counterpart with an explicit __lo__. Indefinite descriptions were introduced into the language in order to imitate the syntax of English and other natural languages.
Indefinite descriptions must fit this mold exactly: there is no way to make one which does not have an explicit outer quantifier (thus _*gerku cu blabi_ is ungrammatical), or which has an explicit inner quantifier (thus _*reboi ci gerku cu blabi_ is also ungrammatical – _re ci gerku cu blabi_ is fine, but means “23 dogs are white”).
Note: Example 6.32 also contains an indefinite description, namely _su'o ci cutci_ ; another version of that example using an explicit __lo__ would be:
**Example 6.45. **
mi | ponse | su'o | ci | lo | cutci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | at-least | three | things-which-really-are | shoes  
I own three (or more) shoes.

## 10.14. Story time
Making strict use of the conventions explained in Section 10.13 would be intolerably awkward when a story is being told. The time at which a story is told by the narrator is usually unimportant to the story. What matters is the flow of time within the story itself. The term “story” in this section refers to any series of statements related in more-or-less time-sequential order, not just a fictional one.
Lojban speakers use a different set of conventions, commonly called “story time”, for inferring tense within a story. It is presumed that the event described by each sentence takes place some time more or less after the previous ones. Therefore, tenseless sentences are implicitly tensed as “what happens next”. In particular, any sticky time setting is advanced by each sentence.
The following mini-story illustrates the important features of story time. A sentence-by-sentence explication follows:
**Example 10.93. **
pu | zu | ki | ku | ne'i | ki | le | kevna  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[past] | [long] | [sticky] | [,] | [inside] | [sticky] | the | cave,  
le | ninmu | goi | ko'a | zutse | le | rokci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | woman | defined-as | she-1 | sat-on | the | rock  
Long ago, in a cave, a woman sat on a rock.  
---  
  

**Example 10.94. **
.i | ko'a | citka | loi | kanba | rectu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| She-1 | eat-(tenseless) | some-of-the-mass-of | goat | flesh.  
She was eating goat's meat.  
---  
  

**Example 10.95. **
.i | ko'a | pu | jukpa | ri | le | mudyfagri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| She | [past] | cook | the-last-mentioned | by-method-the | wood-fire.  
She had cooked the meat over a wood fire.  
---  
  

**Example 10.96. **
.i | lei | rectu | cu | zanglare  
---|---|---|---|---  
| The-mass-of | flesh |  | is-(favorable)-warm.  
The meat was pleasantly warm.  
---  
  

**Example 10.97. **
.i | le | labno | goi | ko'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
| The | wolf | defined-as | it-2  
ba | za | ki | nenri | klama | le | kevna  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[future] | [medium] | [sticky] | within | came | to-the | cave.  
A while later, a wolf came into the cave.  
---  
  

**Example 10.98. **
.i | ko'e | lebna | lei | rectu | ko'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| It-2 | takes-(tenseless) | the-mass-of | flesh | from-her-1.  
It took the meat from her.  
---  
  

**Example 10.99. **
.i | ko'e | bartu | klama  
---|---|---|---  
| It-2 | out | ran  
It ran out.  
---  
  

Example 10.93 sets both the time (long ago) and the place (in a cave) using __ki__ , just like the sentence sequences in Section 10.13. No further space cmavo are used in the rest of the story, so the place is assumed to remain unchanged. The English translation of Example 10.93 is marked for past tense also, as the conventions of English storytelling require: consequently, all other English translation sentences are also in the past tense. (We don't notice how strange this is; even stories about the future are written in past tense!) This conventional use of past tense is not used in Lojban narratives.
Example 10.94 is tenseless. Outside story time, it would be assumed that its event happens simultaneously with that of Example 10.93, since a sticky tense is in effect; the rules of story time, however, imply that the event occurs afterwards, and that the story time has advanced (changing the sticky time set in Example 10.93).
Example 10.95 has an explicit tense. This is taken relative to the latest setting of the sticky time; therefore, the event of Example 10.95 happens before that of Example 10.94. It cannot be determined if Example 10.95 happens before or after Example 10.93.
Example 10.96 is again tenseless. Story time was not changed by the flashback in Example 10.95, so Example 10.96 happens after Example 10.94.
Example 10.97 specifies the future (relative to Example 10.96) and makes it sticky. So all further events happen after Example 10.97.
Example 10.98 and Example 10.99 are again tenseless, and so happen after Example 10.97. (Story time is changed.)
So the overall order is Example 10.93 \- Example 10.95 \- Example 10.94 \- Example 10.96 \- (medium interval) - Example 10.97 \- Example 10.98 \- Example 10.99. It is also possible that Example 10.95 happens before Example 10.93.
If no sticky time (or space) is set initially, the story is set at an unspecified time (or space): the effect is like that of choosing an arbitrary reference point and making it sticky. This style is common in stories that are jokes. The same convention may be used if the context specifies the sticky time sufficiently.

## 12.11. Eliding KE and KEhE rafsi from lujvo
People constructing lujvo usually want them to be as short as possible. To that end, they will discard any cmavo they regard as niceties. The first such cmavo to get thrown out are usually __ke__ and __ke'e__ , the cmavo used to structure and group tanru. We can usually get away with this, because the interpretation of the tertau with __ke__ and __ke'e__ missing is less plausible than that with the cmavo inserted, or because the distinction isn't really important.
For example, in __bakrecpa'o__ , meaning “beefsteak”, the veljvo is
**Example 12.49. **
[ke] | bakni | rectu | [ke'e] | panlo  
---|---|---|---|---  
( | bovine | meat | ) | slice  
  

because of the usual Lojban left-grouping rule. But there doesn't seem to be much difference between that veljvo and
**Example 12.50. **
bakni | ke | rectu | panlo | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
bovine | ( | meat | slice | )  
  

On the other hand, the lujvo __zernerkla__ , meaning “to sneak in”, almost certainly was formed from the veljvo
**Example 12.51. **
zekri | ke | nenri | klama | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
crime | ( | inside | go | )  
to go within, criminally  
---  
  

because the alternative,
**Example 12.52. **
[ke] | zekri | nenri | [ke'e] | klama  
---|---|---|---|---  
( | crime | inside | ) | go  
  

doesn't make much sense. (To go to the inside of a crime? To go into a place where it is criminal to be inside – an interpretation almost identical with Example 12.51 anyway?)
There are cases, however, where omitting a KE or KEhE rafsi can produce another lujvo, equally useful. For example, _xaskemcakcurnu_ means “oceanic shellfish”, and has the veljvo
**Example 12.53. **
xamsi |  | ke | calku | curnu  
---|---|---|---|---  
ocean | type-of | ( | shell | worm | )  
  

(“worm” in Lojban refers to any invertebrate), but _xasycakcurnu_ has the veljvo
**Example 12.54. **
[ke] | xamsi | calku | [ke'e] |  | curnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | ocean | shell | ) | type-of | worm  
  

and might refer to the parasitic worms that infest clamshells.
Such misinterpretation is more likely than not in a lujvo starting with _sel-_ (from __se__), _nal-_ (from __na'e__) or _tol-_ (from __to'e__): the scope of the rafsi will likeliest be presumed to be as narrow as possible, since all of these cmavo normally bind only to the following brivla or __ke__ … __ke'e__ group. For that reason, if we want to modify an entire lujvo by putting __se__ , __na'e__ or __to'e__ before it, it's better to leave the result as two words, or else to insert __ke__ , than to just stick the SE or NAhE rafsi on.
It is all right to replace the phrase _se klama_ with __selkla__ , and the places of __selkla__ are exactly those of _se klama_. But consider the related lujvo __dzukla__ , meaning “to walk to somewhere”. It is a symmmetrical lujvo, derived from the veljvo _cadzu klama_ as follows:
**Example 12.55. **
__cadzu__ : c1 walks on surface c2 using limbs c3
__klama__ : k1 goes to k2 from k3 via route k4 using k5
__dzukla__ : c1=k1 walks to k2 from k3 via route k4 using limbs k5=c3 on surface c2
  

We can swap the k1 and k2 places using _se dzukla_ , but we cannot directly make _se dzukla_ into _seldzukla_ , which would represent the veljvo _selcadzu klama_ and plausibly mean something like “to go to a walking surface”. Instead, we would need _selkemdzukla_ , with an explicit rafsi for __ke__. Similarly, _nalbrablo_ (from _na'e barda bloti_) means “non-big boat”, whereas _na'e brablo_ means “other than a big boat”.
If the lujvo we want to modify with SE has a seltau already starting with a SE rafsi, we can take a shortcut. For instance, __gekmau__ means “happier than”, while _selgekmau_ means “making people happier than, more enjoyable than, more of a 'se gleki' than”. If something is less enjoyable than something else, we can say it is _se selgekmau_.
But we can also say it is _selselgekmau_. Two __se__ cmavo in a row cancel each other (_se se gleki_ means the same as just __gleki__), so there would be no good reason to have _selsel_ in a lujvo with that meaning. Instead, we can feel free to interpret _selsel-_ as _selkemsel-_. The rafsi combinations _terter-_ , _velvel-_ and _xelxel-_ work in the same way.
Other SE combinations like _selter-_ , although they might conceivably mean _se te_ , more than likely should be interpreted in the same way, namely as _se ke te_ , since there is no need to re-order places in the way that _se te_ provides. (See Section 9.4.)

## 13.14. Vocative scales
“Vocatives” are words used to address someone directly; they precede and mark a name used in direct address, just as __la__ (and the other members of selma'o LA) mark a name used to refer to someone. The vocatives actually are indicators – in fact, discursives – but the need to tie them to names and other descriptions of listeners requires them to be separated from selma'o UI. But like the cmavo of UI, the members of selma'o COI can be “negated” with __nai__ to get the opposite part of the scale.
Because of the need for redundancy in noisy environments, the Lojban design does not compress the vocatives into a minimum number of scales. Doing so would make a non-redundant __nai__ too often vital to interpretation of a protocol signal, as explained later in this section.
The grammar of vocatives is explained in Section 6.11; but in brief, a vocative may be followed by a name (without __la__), a description (without __le__ or its relatives), a complete sumti, or nothing at all (if the addressee is obvious from the context). There is an elidable terminator, __do'u__ (of selma'o DOhU) which is almost never required unless no name (or other indication of the addressee) follows the vocative.
Using any vocative except __mi'e__ (explained below) implicitly defines the meaning of the pro-sumti __do__ , as the whole point of vocatives is to specify the listener, or at any rate the desired listener – even if the desired listener isn't listening! We will use the terms “speaker” and “listener” for clarity, although in written Lojban the appropriate terms would be “writer” and “reader”.
In the following list of vocatives, the translations include the symbol X. This represents the name (or identifying description, or whatever) of the listener.
The cmavo __doi__ is the general-purpose vocative. Unlike the cmavo of selma'o COI, explained below, __doi__ can precede a name directly without an intervening pause. It is not considered a scale, and _doinai_ is not grammatical. In general, __doi__ needs no translation in English (we just use names by themselves without any preceding word, although in poetic styles we sometimes say “Oh X”, which is equivalent to __doi__). One may attach an attitudinal to __doi__ to express various English vocatives. For example, _doi .io_ means “Sir/Madam!”, whereas _doi .ionai_ means “You there!”.
All members of selma'o COI require a pause when used immediately before a name, in order to prevent the name from absorbing the COI word. This is unlike selma'o DOI and LA, which do not require pauses because the syllables of these cmavo are not permitted to be embedded in a Lojban name. When calling out to someone, this is fairly natural, anyway. “Hey! John!” is thus a better translation of _ju'i .djan._ than “Hey John!”. No pause is needed if the vocative reference is something other than a name, as in the title of the Lojban journal, _ju'i lobypli_.
(Alternatively, __doi__ can be inserted between the COI cmavo and the name, making a pause unnecessary: _coi doi djan._)
coi |  greetings  
---|---  
“Hello, X”; “Greetings, X”; indicates a greeting to the listener.   
---  
co'o |  partings  
---|---  
“Good-bye, X”; indicates parting from immediate company by either the speaker or the listener. __coico'o__ means “greeting in passing”.   
---  
ju'i |  [jundi] |  attention |  at ease |  ignore me/us  
---|---|---|---|---  
“Attention/Lo/Hark/Behold/Hey!/Listen, X”; indicates an important communication that the listener should listen to.   
---  
nu'e |  [nupre] |  promise |  release promise |  non-promise  
---|---|---|---|---  
“I promise, X”; indicates a promise to the listener. In some contexts, __nu'e__ may be prefixed to an oath or other formal declaration.   
---  
ta'a |  [tavla] |  interruption  
---|---|---  
“I interrupt, X”, “I desire the floor, X”; a vocative expression to (possibly) interrupt and claim the floor to make a statement or expression. This can be used for both rude and polite interruptions, although rude interruptions will probably tend not to use a vocative at all. An appropriate response to an interruption might be __re'i__ (or __re'inai__ to ignore the interruption).   
---  
pe'u |  [cpedu] |  request  
---|---|---  
“Please, X”; indicates a request to the listener. It is a formal, non-attitudinal, equivalent of __e'o__ with a specific recipient being addressed. On the other hand, __e'o__ may be used when there is no specific listener, but merely a “sense of petition floating in the air”, as it were.   
---  
ki'e |  [ckire] |  appreciation; gratitude |  disappreciation; ingratitude  
---|---|---|---  
“Thank you, X”; indicates appreciation or gratitude toward the listener. The usual response is __je'e__ , but __fi'i__ is appropriate on rare occasions: see the explanation of __fi'i__.   
---  
fi'i |  [friti] |  welcome; offering |  unwelcome; inhospitality  
---|---|---|---  
“At your service, X”; “Make yourself at home, X”; offers hospitality (possibly in response to thanks, but not necessarily) to the listener. Note that __fi'i__ is _not_ the equivalent of American English “You're welcome” as a mechanical response to “Thank you”; that is __je'e__ , as noted below.   
---  
be'e |  [benji] |  request to send  
---|---|---  
“Request to send to X”; indicates that the speaker wishes to express something, and wishes to ensure that the listener is listening. In a telephone conversation, can be used to request the desired conversant(s). A more colloquial equivalent is “Hello? Can I speak to X?”.   
---  
re'i |  [bredi] |  ready to receive |  not ready  
---|---|---|---  
“Ready to receive, X”; indicates that the speaker is attentive and awaiting communication from the listener. It can be used instead of __mi'e__ to respond when called to the telephone. The negative form can be used to prevent the listener from continuing to talk when the speaker is unable to pay attention: it can be translated “Hold on!” or “Just a minute”.   
---  
mu'o |  [mulno] |  completion of utterance |  more to follow  
---|---|---|---  
“Over, X”; indicates that the speaker has completed the current utterance and is ready to hear a response from the listener. The negative form signals that the pause or non-linguistic sound which follows does not represent the end of the current utterance: more colloquially, “I'm not done talking!”  
---  
je'e |  [jimpe] |  successful receipt |  unsuccessful receipt  
---|---|---|---  
“Roger, X!”, “I understand”; acknowledges the successful receipt of a communication from the listener. The negative form indicates failure to receive correctly, and is usually followed by __ke'o__. The colloquial English equivalents of __je'e__ and __je'enai__ are the grunt typically written “uh-huh” and “What?/Excuse me?”. __je'e__ is also used to mean “You're welcome” when that is a response to “Thank you”.   
---  
vi'o |  |  will comply |  will not comply  
---|---|---|---  
“Wilco, X”, “I understand and will comply”. Similar to __je'e__ but signals an intention (similar to __.ai__) to comply with the other speaker's request. This cmavo is the main way of saying “OK” in Lojban, in the usual sense of “Agreed!”, although __.ie__ carries some of the same meaning. The negative form indicates that the message was received but that you will not comply: a very colloquial version is “No way!”.   
---  
ke'o |  [krefu] |  please repeat |  no repeat needed  
---|---|---|---  
“What did you say, X?”; a request for repetition or clarification due to unsuccessful receipt or understanding. This is the vocative equivalent of __ki'a__ , and is related to __je'enai__. The negative form may be rendered “Okay, already; I get the point!”  
---  
fe'o |  [fanmo] |  end of communication |  not done  
---|---|---|---  
“Over and out, X”; indicates completion of statement(s) and communication directed at the identified person(s). Used to terminate a letter if a signature is not required because the sender has already been identified (as in memos). The negative form means “Wait, hold it, we're not done!” and differs from __mu'onai__ in that it means more exchanges are to follow, rather than that the current exchange is incomplete.  Do not confuse __fe'o__ with __fa'o__ (selma'o FAhO) which is a mechanical, extra-grammatical signal that a text is complete. One may say __fe'o__ to one participant of a multi-way conversation and then go on speaking to the others.   
---  
mi'e |  [cmavo: mi] |  self-identification |  non-identification  
---|---|---|---  
“And I am X”; a generalized self-vocative. Although grammatically just like the other members of selma'o COI, __mi'e__ is quite different semantically. In particular, rather than specifying the listener, the person whose name (or description) follows __mi'e__ is taken to be the speaker. Therefore, using __mi'e__ specifies the meaning of the pro-sumti __mi__. It can be used to introduce oneself, to close letters, or to identify oneself on the telephone.   
---  
This cmavo is often combined with other members of COI: _fe'omi'e_ would be an appropriate closing at the end of a letter; _re'imi'e_ would be a self-vocative used in delayed responses, as when called to the phone, or possibly in a roll-call. As long as the __mi'e__ comes last, the following name is that of the speaker; if another COI cmavo is last, the following name is that of the listener. It is not possible to name both speaker and listener in a single vocative expression, but this fact is of no importance, because wherever one vocative expression is grammatical, any number of consecutive ones may appear.
The negative form denies an identity which someone else has attributed to you; _mi'enai .djan._ means that you are saying you are not John.
Many of the vocatives have been listed with translations which are drawn from radio use: “roger”, “wilco”, “over and out”. This form of translation does not mean that Lojban is a language of CB enthusiasts, but rather that in most natural languages these forms are so well handled by the context that only in specific domains (like speaking on the radio) do they need special words. In Lojban, dependence on the context can be dangerous, as speaker and listener may not share the right context, and so the vocatives provide a formal protocol for use when it is appropriate. Other appropriate contexts include computer communications and parliamentary procedure: in the latter context, the protocol question _ta'apei_ would mean “Will the speaker yield?”

## 7.6. Anaphoric pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the ri-series and the go'i-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ri |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats last sumti)   
---|---|---|---  
ra |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats previous sumti)  
ru |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats long-ago sumti)  
go'i |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last bridi)  
go'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats previous bridi)  
go'u |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats long-ago bridi)  
go'e |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last-but-one bridi)  
go'o |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats future bridi)  
nei |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats current bridi)  
no'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats outer bridi)  
ra'o |  RAhO |  |  pro-cmavo update  
The term “anaphora” literally means “repetition”, but is used in linguistics to refer to pronouns whose significance is the repetition of earlier words, namely their antecedents. Lojban provides three pro-sumti anaphora, __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ ; and three corresponding pro-bridi anaphora, __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__. These cmavo reveal the same vowel pattern as the ti-series, but the “distances” referred to are not physical distances, but distances from the anaphoric cmavo to its antecedent.
The cmavo __ri__ is the simplest of these; it has the same referent as the last complete sumti appearing before the __ri__ :
**Example 7.30. **
la | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | ri | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | [repeat-last-sumti] | room.  
Alice sleeps in her room.  
---  
  

The __ri__ in Example 7.30 is equivalent to repeating the last sumti, which is _la .alis._ , so Example 7.30 is equivalent to:
**Example 7.31. **
la | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | la | .alis. | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | that-named | Alice | room.  
Alice sleeps in Alice's room.  
---  
  

Note that __ri__ does not repeat _le ri kumfa_ , because that sumti is not yet complete when __ri__ appears. This prevents __ri__ from getting entangled in paradoxes of self-reference. (There are plenty of other ways to do that!) Note also that sumti within other sumti, as in quotations, abstractions, and the like, are counted in the order of their beginnings; thus a lower level sumti like _la alis._ in Example 7.31 is considered to be more recent than a higher level sumti that contains it.
Certain sumti are ignored by __ri__ ; specifically, most of the other cmavo of KOhA, and the almost-grammatically-equivalent lerfu words of selma'o BY. It is simpler just to repeat these directly:
**Example 7.32. **
mi | prami | mi  
---|---|---  
I | love | me.  
I love myself.  
---  
  

However, the cmavo of the ti-series can be picked up by __ri__ , because you might have changed what you are pointing at, so repeating __ti__ may not be effective. Likewise, __ri__ itself (or rather its antecedent) can be repeated by a later __ri__ ; in fact, a string of __ri__ cmavo with no other intervening sumti always all repeat the same sumti:
**Example 7.33. **
la | djan. | viska | le | tricu | .i  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | sees | the | tree. |   
ri | se jadni | le |  | ri | jimca  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[repeat-last] | is-adorned-by | the | of- | [repeat-last] | branch.  
John sees the tree. It is adorned by its branches.  
---  
  

Here the second __ri__ has as antecedent the first __ri__ , which has as antecedent _le tricu_. All three refer to the same thing: a tree.
To refer to the next-to-last sumti, the third-from-last sumti, and so on, __ri__ may be subscripted (subscripts are explained in Section 19.6):
**Example 7.34. **
lo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | rixire  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [repeat-next-to-last].  
.i | la | .alis. | pilno | riximu  
---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | uses | [repeat-fifth-from-last].  
  

Here _rixire_ , or “ri-sub-2”, skips _la rik._ to reach _lo forca_. In the same way, _riximu_ , or “ri-sub-5”, skips _la .alis._ , _rixire_ , _la rik._ , and _lo forca_ to reach _lo smuci_. As can clearly be seen, this procedure is barely practicable in writing, and would break down totally in speech.
Therefore, the vaguer __ra__ and __ru__ are also provided. The cmavo __ra__ repeats a recently used sumti, and __ru__ one that was further back in the speech or text. The use of __ra__ and __ru__ forces the listener to guess at the referent, but makes life easier for the speaker. Can __ra__ refer to the last sumti, like __ri__? The answer is no if __ri__ has also been used. If __ri__ has not been used, then __ra__ might be the last sumti. Likewise, if __ra__ has been used, then any use of __ru__ would repeat a sumti earlier than the one __ra__ is repeating. A more reasonable version of Example 7.34, but one that depends more on context, is:
**Example 7.35. **
lo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | ra  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [some-previous-thing].  
.i | la | .alis. | pilno | ru  
---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | uses | [some-more-remote-thing].  
  

In Example 7.35, the use of __ra__ tells us that something other than _la rik._ is the antecedent; _lo forca_ is the nearest sumti, so it is probably the antecedent. Similarly, the antecedent of __ru__ must be something even further back in the utterance than _lo forca_ , and _lo smuci_ is the obvious candidate.
The meaning of __ri__ must be determined every time it is used. Since __ra__ and __ru__ are more vaguely defined, they may well retain the same meaning for a while, but the listener cannot count on this behavior. To make a permanent reference to something repeated by __ri__ , __ra__ , or __ru__ , use __goi__ and a ko'a-series cmavo:
**Example 7.36. **
la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | goes-to | the | store  
.i | ri | goi | ko'a | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---  
. | It-last-mentioned | also-known-as | it-1 | is-blue.  
  

allows the store to be referred to henceforth as __ko'a__ without ambiguity. Example 7.36 is equivalent to Example 7.21 and eliminates any possibility of __ko'a__ being interpreted by the listener as referring to Alice.
The cmavo __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__ follow exactly the same rules as __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ , except that they are pro-bridi, and therefore repeat bridi, not sumti – specifically, main sentence bridi. Any bridi that are embedded within other bridi, such as relative clauses or abstractions, are not counted. Like the cmavo of the broda-series, the cmavo of the go'i-series copy all sumti with them. This makes __go'i__ by itself convenient for answering a question affirmatively, or for repeating the last bridi, possibly with new sumti:
**Example 7.37. **
xu | zo | .djan. | cmene | do | .i | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True-false?] | The-word |  “John” | is-the-name-of | you? |  | [repeat last bridi].  
Is John your name? Yes.  
---  
  

**Example 7.38. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | .i | do | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store | . | You | [repeat last bridi].  
I go to the store . You, too.  
---  
  

Note that Example 7.38 means the same as Example 7.26, but without the bother of assigning an actual broda-series word to the first bridi. For long-term reference, use _go'i cei broda_ or the like, analogously to _ri goi ko'a_ in Example 7.36.
The remaining four cmavo of the go'i-series are provided for convenience or for achieving special effects. The cmavo __go'e__ means the same as _go'ixire_ : it repeats the last bridi but one. This is useful in conversation:
**Example 7.39. **
A: | mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
A: | I | [future] | go-to | the | store.  
A: I am going to the store.  
---  
B: | mi | nelci | le | si'o | mi | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
B: | I | like | the | concept-of | I | [repeat-last-bridi].  
B: I like the idea of my going.  
---  
A: | do | go'e  
---|---|---  
A: | You | [repeat-last-bridi-but-one].  
A: You'll go, too.  
---  
  

Here B's sentence repeats A's within an abstraction (explained in Chapter 11): _le si'o mi go'i_ means _le si'o mi klama le zarci_. Why must B use the word __mi__ explicitly to replace the x1 of _mi klama le zarci_ , even though it looks like __mi__ is replacing __mi__? Because B's __mi__ refers to B, whereas A's __mi__ refers to A. If B said:
**Example 7.40. **
mi nelci le si'o go'i
  

that would mean:
> I like the idea of your going to the store.
The repetition signalled by __go'i__ is not literally of words, but of concepts. Finally, A repeats her own sentence, but with the x1 changed to __do__ , meaning B. Note that in Example 7.39, the tense __ba__ (future time) is carried along by both __go'i__ and __go'e__.
Descriptions based on go'i-series cmavo can be very useful for repeating specific sumti of previous bridi:
**Example 7.41. **
le | xekri | mlatu | cu | klama | le | zarci | .i | le  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | black | cat |  | goes-to | the | store. |  | That-described-as-the-x1-place-of  
go'i | cu | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
[repeat-last-bridi] |  | walks-on | the | ice.  
The black cat goes to the store. It walks on the ice.

Here the __go'i__ repeats _le xekri mlatu cu klama le zarci_ , and since __le__ makes the x1 place into a description, and the x1 place of this bridi is _le xekri mlatu_ , _le go'i_ means _le xekri mlatu_.
The cmavo __go'o__ , __nei__ , and __no'a__ have been little used so far. They repeat respectively some future bridi, the current bridi, and the bridi that encloses the current bridi (__no'a__ , unlike the other members of the go'i- series, can repeat non-sentence bridi). Here are a few examples:
**Example 7.42. **
mi | nupre | le | nu | mi | go'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | promise | the | event-of | I | [repeat-future-bridi].  
.i | ba | dunda | le | djini |  | le | bersa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [Future] | give | the | money | to | the | son  
.i | ba | dunda | le | zdani |  | le | tixnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [Future] | give | the | house | to | the | daughter  
I promise to do the following: Give the money to my son. Give the house to my daughter.  
---  
  

(Note: The Lojban does not contain an equivalent of the __my__ in the colloquial English; it leaves the fact that it is the speaker's son and daughter that are referred to implicit. To make the fact explicit, use _le bersa_ /_tixnu be mi_.)
For good examples of __nei__ and __no'a__ , we need nested bridi contexts:
**Example 7.43. **
mi | se | pluka | le | nu | do | pensi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | am-pleased-by | the | event-of | (you | think-about | the | (event-of  
nei | kei | pu | le | nu | do | zukte  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[main-bridi] | ) | before | the | (event-of | your | acting).  
I am pleased that you thought about whether I would be pleased (about ...) before you acted.  
---  
  

**Example 7.44. **
mi | ba | klama | ca | le | nu | do | no'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | go | [present] | the | event-of | you | [repeats outer bridi]  
I will go when you do.  
---  
  

Finally, __ra'o__ is a cmavo that can be appended to any go'i-series cmavo, or indeed any cmavo of selma'o GOhA, to signal that pro-sumti or pro-bridi cmavo in the antecedent are to be repeated literally and reinterpreted in their new context. Normally, any pro-sumti used within the antecedent of the pro-bridi keep their meanings intact. In the presence of __ra'o__ , however, their meanings must be reinterpreted with reference to the new environment. If someone says to you:
**Example 7.45. **
mi ba lumci le mi karce  
---  
I will wash my car.  
---  
  

you might reply either:
**Example 7.46. **
mi go'i  
---  
I will wash your car.  
---  
  

or:
**Example 7.47. **
mi go'i ra'o  
---  
I will wash my car.  
---  
  

The __ra'o__ forces the second __mi__ from the original bridi to mean the new speaker rather than the former speaker. This means that _go'e ra'o_ would be an acceptable alternative to _do go'e_ in B's statement in Example 7.39.
The anaphoric pro-sumti of this section can be used in quotations, but never refer to any of the supporting text outside the quotation, since speakers presumably do not know that they may be quoted by someone else.
However, a _ri-_ series or _go'a-_ series reference within a quotation can refer to something mentioned in an earlier quotation if the two quotations are closely related in time and context. This allows a quotation to be broken up by narrative material without interfering with the pro-sumti within it. Here's an example:
**Example 7.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | lu | mi | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | says | [quote] | I | go-to | the | store | [unquote].  
.i | la | .alis. | cusku | lu | mi | go'i | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | says | [quote] | I | [repeat] | [unquote].  
John says, “I am going to the store.” Alice says, “Me too.”  
---  
  

Of course, there is no problem with narrative material referring to something within a quotation: people who quote, unlike people who are quoted, are aware of what they are doing.

## 14.7. More than two propositions
So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.
Of the four primitive truth functions A, E, O, and U, all but O have the same truth values no matter how their component sentences are associated in pairs. Therefore,
**Example 14.31. **
mi | dotco | .ije | mi | ricfu | .ije | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | And | I | am-rich. | And | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,
**Example 14.32. **
mi | dotco | .ija | mi | ricfu | .ija | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | Or | I | am-rich. | Or | I | am-a-man.  
  

means that one or more of the component sentences is true.
O, however, is different. Working out the truth table for
**Example 14.33. **
mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | .ijo | mi | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-German. | If-and-only-if | I | am-rich. | If-and-only-if | I | am-a-man.  
  

shows that Example 14.33 does not mean that either I am all three of these things or none of them; instead, an accurate translation would be:
> Of the three properties – German-ness, wealth, and manhood – I possess either exactly one or else all three.
Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid O with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.
In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by Example 14.33 without repeating one of the bridi. See Example 14.48.
There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is the meaning of: 
**Example 14.34. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John. | And | I | like | that-named | Martha.  
.ija | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

Does this mean:
**Example 14.35. **
I like John, and I like either Martha or Mary or both.
  

Or is the correct translation:
**Example 14.36. **
Either I like John and I like Martha, or I like Mary, or both.
  

Example 14.36 is the correct translation of Example 14.34. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:
**Example 14.37. **
ga | ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Either | (Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | I | like | that-named | Martha)  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.34, whereas
**Example 14.38. **
ge | mi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---  
Both | I | like | that-named | John  
gi | ga | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (Either | I | like | that-named | Martha  
gi | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary).  
  

is not equivalent to Example 14.34, but is instead a valid translation into Lojban, using forethought, of Example 14.35.

## 14.8. Grouping of afterthought connectives
There are several ways in Lojban to render Example 14.35 using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo __bo__ (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with __bo__ are interpreted before connections not so marked. Example 14.39 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.38:
**Example 14.39. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | .ije | mi | nelci | la | martas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | that-named | John, | and | I | like | that-named | Martha  
.ijabo | mi | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | like | that-named | Mary.  
  

The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by __.i__ __ja__ first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by __.i__ __je__.
Eks can have __bo__ attached in exactly the same way, so that Example 14.40 is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39:
**Example 14.40. **
mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with __bo__ , for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.
What happens if __bo__ is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in Example 14.41?
**Example 14.41. **
mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
  

Does this wind up meaning the same as Example 14.34 and Example 14.36? Not at all. A second rule relating to __bo__ is that where several __bo__ -marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, Example 14.41 in fact means the same as Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with __bo__ should be avoided.
The use of __bo__ , therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of Example 14.37 and Example 14.38, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ are used with ijeks, and __ke__ and __ke'e__ with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (__ke__ and __ke'e__ are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:
**Example 14.42. **
I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
  

where the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express Example 14.42 in afterthought, we can say:
**Example 14.43. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije[bo] | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me,  
.ijanai | mi | prami | do | .ijebo | do | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | I | love | you | and | you | love | me.  
  

marking two of the ijeks with __bo__ for high precedence. (The first __bo__ is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)
But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:
**Example 14.44. **
tu'e | mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me | )  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

where the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ pairs set off the structure. The cmavo __tu'u__ is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in Example 14.44 is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.
In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to __bo__ grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.
Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:
**Example 14.45. **
mi | cinba | do | .ije | do | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | kiss | you | and | you | kiss | me  
.ijanai | tu'e | mi | prami | do | .ije | do | prami | mi | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
if | ( | I | love | you | and | you | love | me | ).  
  

What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider
**Example 14.46. **
I walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.
  

Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to Example 14.44, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with __ke__ , so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing Example 14.47, which is instead parallel to Example 14.45:
**Example 14.47. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci | .e | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market | and | the | house  
.a | ke | le | ckule | .e | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | the | school | and | the | office | ).  
  

If sumti were allowed to begin with __ke__ , unavoidable ambiguities would result, so __ke__ grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to __tu'e__ grouping of bridi, as Example 14.44 shows.
Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of Example 14.33: “I am German, rich, and a man – or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:
**Example 14.48. **
[tu'e] | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | ricfu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-rich | )  
.ije | tu'e | mi | dotco | .ijo | mi | nanmu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | ( | I | am-German | if-and-only-if | I | am-a-man | ).  
  

The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.

## 11.4. Property abstractions
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ka |  NU |  property abstractor  
---|---|---  
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
The things described by _le nu_ descriptions (or, to put it another way, the things of which __nu__ selbri may correctly be predicated) are only moderately “abstract”. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is “the property of being blue”, or “the property of being a go-er”? They are what logicians call “intensions”. If John has a heart, then “the property of having a heart” is an abstract object which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,
**Example 11.21. **
la | djan. | cu | se risna | zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-as-heart | something-unspecified.  
John has a heart.  
---  
  

has the same truth conditions as
**Example 11.22. **
la | djan. | cu | ckaji  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | has-the-property  
le | ka | se risna | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | having-as-heart | something.  
John has the property of having a heart.  
---  
  

(The English word “have” frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban properties: things are said to “have” properties, but this is not the same sense of “have” as in “I have money”, which is possession.)
Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:
**Example 11.23. **
do | cnino | mi | le | ka | xunre | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-new | to-me | in-the-quality-of-the | property-of | being-red.  
You are new to me in redness.  
---  
  

(The English suffix “-ness” often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix “-ity”.)
We can also move the property description to the x1 place of Example 11.23, producing:
**Example 11.24. **
le | ka | do | xunre | [kei] | cu | cnino | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | property-of | your | being-red |  |  | is-new | to me.  
Your redness is new to me.  
---  
  

It would be suitable to use Example 11.23 and Example 11.24 to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.
There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:
**Example 11.25. **
ka | mi | prami | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | me | loving | something-unspecified  
  

is quite different from
**Example 11.26. **
ka | [zo'e] | prami | mi | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---  
a-property-of | something-unspecified | loving | me  
  

In particular, sentences like Example 11.27 and Example 11.28 are quite different in meaning:
**Example 11.27. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami  
---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X)  
I love John more than I love George.  
---  
  

**Example 11.28. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka |  | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property of | (X | loves | me).  
John loves me more than George loves me.  
---  
  

The “X” used in the glosses of Example 11.27 through Example 11.28 as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in Section 11.2. Instead, the cmavo __ce'u__ of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)
Therefore, an explicit equivalent of Example 11.27, with no ellipsis, is:
**Example 11.29. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | mi | prami | ce'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (I | love | X).  
  

and of Example 11.28 is:
**Example 11.30. **
la | djan. | cu | zmadu | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | exceeds | that-named | George  
le | ka | ce'u | prami | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
in-the | property-of | (X | loves | me).  
  

This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:
**Example 11.31. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of |  | giving | the | horse  
  

into
**Example 11.32. **
le | ka | ce'u | dunda | le | xirma |  | [zo'e] | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | someone-unspecified | )  
the property of being a giver of the horse  
---  
  

which is the most natural interpretation of Example 11.31, versus
**Example 11.33. **
le | ka | [zo'e] | dunda | le | xirma |  | ce'u | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (someone-unspecified | is-a-giver-of | the | horse | to | X | )  
the property of being one to whom the horse is given  
---  
  

which is also a possible interpretation.
It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction. Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri __bridi__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _bridi_ _ x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction) among arguments (sequence/set) x3
The place structure of __ka__ abstraction selbri is simply:
> _ _ka_ _ x1 is a property of (the bridi)

## 7.11. Abstraction focus pro-sumti: _ce'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __ce'u__ is used within abstraction bridi, particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo __ka__. Abstractions, including the uses of __ce'u__ , are discussed in full in Chapter 11.
In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using __ce'u__. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly between:
**Example 7.71. **
le | ka | ce'u | gleki  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | being-happy)  
the property of being happy  
---  
happiness  
  

and
**Example 7.72. **
le | ka | gleki | ce'u  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (being-happy-about | X)  
the property of being that which someone is happy about

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 10.22. Conversion of sumti tcita: JAI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
jai |  JAI |  tense conversion  
---|---|---  
fai |  FA |  indefinite place  
Conversion is the regular Lojban process of moving around the places of a place structure. The cmavo of selma'o SE serve this purpose, exchanging the first place with one of the others:
**Example 10.162. **
mi | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | go-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.163. **
le | zarci | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-gone-to | by-me.  
  

It is also possible to bring a place that is specified by a sumti tcita (for the purposes of this chapter, a tense sumti tcita) to the front, by using __jai__ plus the tense as the grammatical equivalent of SE:
**Example 10.164. **
le | ratcu | cu | citka | le | cirla | vi | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | rat |  | eats | the | cheese | [short-distance] | the | park.  
The rat eats the cheese in the park.  
---  
  

**Example 10.165. **
le | panka | cu | jai vi | citka | le | cirla | fai | le | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | park |  | is-the-place-of | eating | the | cheese | by | the | rat.  
The park is where the rat eats the cheese.  
---  
  

In Example 10.165, the construction JAI+tense converts the location sumti into the first place. The previous first place has nowhere to go, since the location sumti is not a numbered place; however, it can be inserted back into the bridi with __fai__ , the indefinite member of selma'o FA.
(The other members of FA are used to mark the first, second, etc. places of a bridi explicitly:
**Example 10.166. **
fa mi cu klama fe le zarci
  

means the same as
**Example 10.167. **
fe le zarci cu klama fa mi
  

as well as the simple
**Example 10.168. **
mi cu klama le zarci
  

in which the place structure is determined by position.)
Like SE conversion, JAI+tense conversion is especially useful in descriptions with LE selma'o:
**Example 10.169. **
mi | viska | le | jai vi | citka | be | le | cirla  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | place-of | eating |  | the | cheese.  
  

Here the eater of the cheese is elided, so no __fai__ appears.
Of course, temporal tenses are also usable with JAI:
**Example 10.170. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | jai | ca | morsi | be | fai | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the |  | [present] | is-dead |  | of | that-named |  “John” | .  
I know the time of John's death.  
---  
I know when John died.

## 10.12. Tenses as sumti tcita
So far, we have seen tenses only just before the selbri, or (equivalently in meaning) floating about the bridi with __ku__. There is another major use for tenses in Lojban: as sumti tcita, or argument tags. A tense may be used to add spatial or temporal information to a bridi as, in effect, an additional place:
**Example 10.69. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | ca | le | nu | do | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market | [present] | the | event-of | you | go-to  
le | zdani  
---|---  
the | house.  
I go to the market when you go to the house.  
---  
  

Here __ca__ does not appear before the selbri, nor with __ku__ ; instead, it governs the following sumti, the _le nu_ construct. What Example 10.69 asserts is that the action of the main bridi is happening at the same time as the event mentioned by that sumti. So __ca__ , which means “now” when used with a selbri, means “simultaneously-with” when used with a sumti. Consider another example:
**Example 10.70. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | pu | le | nu | do | pu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market | [past] | the | event-of | you | [past] | go-to  
le | zdani  
---|---  
the | house.  
  

The second __pu__ is simply the past tense marker for the event of your going to the house, and says that this event is in the speaker's past. How are we to understand the first __pu__ , the sumti tcita?
All of our imaginary journeys so far have started at the speaker's location in space and time. Now we are specifying an imaginary journey that starts at a different location, namely at the event of your going to the house. Example 10.70 then says that my going to the market is in the past, relative not to the speaker's present moment, but instead relative to the moment when you went to the house. Example 10.70 can therefore be translated:
> I had gone to the market before you went to the house.
(Other translations are possible, depending on the ever-present context.) Spatial direction and distance sumti tcita are exactly analogous:
**Example 10.71. **
le | ratcu | cu | citka | le | cirla | vi | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | rat |  | eats | the | cheese | [short-time-distance] | the | park.  
The rat eats the cheese near the park.  
---  
  

**Example 10.72. **
le | ratcu | cu | citka | le | cirla | vi | le | vu | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | rat |  | eats | the | cheese | [short-distance] | the | [long-distance] | park  
The rat eats the cheese near the faraway park.  
---  
  

**Example 10.73. **
le | ratcu | cu | citka | le | cirla | vu | le | vi | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | rat |  | eats | the | cheese | [long-distance] | the | [short-distance] | park  
The rat eats the cheese far away from the nearby park.  
---  
  

The event contours of selma'o ZAhO (and their space equivalents, prefixed with __fe'e__) are also useful as sumti tcita. The interpretation of ZAhO tcita differs from that of FAhA, VA, PU, and ZI tcita, however. The event described in the sumti is viewed as a process, and the action of the main bridi occurs at the phase of the process which the ZAhO specifies, or at least some part of that phase. The action of the main bridi itself is seen as a point event, so that there is no issue about which phase of the main bridi is intended. For example:
**Example 10.74. **
mi | morsi | ba'o | le | nu | mi | jmive  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-dead | [perfective] | the | event-of | I | live.  
I die in the aftermath of my living.  
---  
  

Here the (point-)event of my being dead is the portion of my living-process which occurs after the process is complete. Contrast Example 10.74 with:
**Example 10.75. **
mi | morsi | ba | le | nu | mi | jmive  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-dead | [future] | the | event-of | I | live.  
  

As explained in Section 10.6, Example 10.75 does not exclude the possibility that I died before I ceased to live!
Likewise, we might say:
**Example 10.76. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | pu'o | le | nu | mi | citka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store | [inchoative] | the | event-of | I | eat  
  

which indicates that before my eating begins, I go to the store, whereas
**Example 10.77. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | ba'o | le | nu | mi | citka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store | [perfective] | the | event-of | I | eat  
  

would indicate that I go to the store after I am finished eating.
Here is an example which mixes temporal ZAhO (as a tense) and spatial ZAhO (as a sumti tcita):
**Example 10.78. **
le | bloti | pu | za'o | xelklama  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | boat | [past] | [superfective] | is-a-transport-mechanism  
fe'e | ba'o | le | lalxu  
---|---|---|---  
[space] | [perfective] | the | lake.  
The boat sailed for too long and beyond the lake.  
---  
  

Probably it sailed up onto the dock. One point of clarification: although _xelklama_ appears to mean simply “is-a-mode-of-transport”, it does not – the bridi of Example 10.78 has four omitted arguments, and thus has the (physical) journey which goes on too long as part of its meaning.
The remaining tense cmavo, which have to do with interval size, dimension, and continuousness (or lack thereof) are interpreted to let the sumti specify the particular interval over which the main bridi operates:
**Example 10.79. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | reroi | le | ca | djedi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market | [twice] | the | [present] | day.  
I go/went/will go to the market twice today.  
---  
  

Be careful not to confuse a tense used as a sumti tcita with a tense used within a seltcita sumti:
**Example 10.80. **
loi | snime | cu | carvi  
---|---|---|---  
Some-of-the-mass-of | snow |  | rains  
ze'u | le | ca | dunra  
---|---|---|---  
[long-time-interval] | the | [present] | winter.  
Snow falls during this winter.  
---  
  

claims that the interval specified by “this winter” is long, as events of snowfall go, whereas
**Example 10.81. **
loi | snime | cu | carvi | ca | le | ze'u | dunra  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some-of-the-mass-of | snow |  | rains | [present] | the | [long-time] | winter.  
Snow falls in the long winter.  
---  
  

claims that during some part of the winter, which is long as winters go, snow falls.

## 5.12. Scalar negation of selbri
Negation is too large and complex a topic to explain fully in this chapter; see Chapter 15. In brief, there are two main types of negation in Lojban. This section is concerned with so-called “scalar negation”, which is used to state that a true relation between the sumti is something other than what the selbri specifies. Scalar negation is expressed by cmavo of selma'o NAhE:
**Example 5.116. **
la | .alis. | cu | na'e | ke | cadzu | klama | [ke'e] | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | non- | ( | walkingly | goes-to | ) | the | market.  
Alice doesn't walk to the market.  
---  
  

meaning that Alice's relationship to the market is something other than that of walking there. But if the __ke__ were omitted, the result would be:
**Example 5.117. **
la | .alis. | cu | na'e | cadzu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice |  | non- | walkingly | goes-to | the | market.  
Alice doesn't walk to the market.  
---  
  

meaning that Alice does go there in some way (__klama__ is not negated), but by a means other than that of walking. Example 5.116 negates both __cadzu__ and __klama__ , suggesting that Alice's relation to the market is something different from walkingly-going; it might be walking without going, or going without walking, or neither.
Of course, any of the simple selbri types explained in Section 5.9 may be used in place of brivla in any of these examples:
**Example 5.118. **
la | djonz. | cu | na'e | pamoi | cusku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Jones |  | is-non- | 1st | speaker  
Jones is not the first speaker.  
---  
  

Since only __pamoi__ is negated, an appropriate inference is that he is some other kind of speaker.
Here is an assortment of more complex examples showing the interaction of scalar negation with __bo__ grouping, __ke__ and __ke'e__ grouping, logical connection, and sumti linked with __be__ and __bei__ :
**Example 5.119. **
mi | na'e | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | be'o | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | ((non- | quickly) | (walking |  | using | the | arms | )) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, walking using my arms other than quickly.  
---  
  

In Example 5.119, __na'e__ negates only __sutra__. Contrast Example 5.120:
**Example 5.120. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | [be'o]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | non- | ( | quickly | (walking |  | using | the | arms | )  
ke'e | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, other than by walking quickly on my arms.  
---  
  

Now consider Example 5.121 and Example 5.122, which are equivalent in meaning, but use __ke__ grouping and __bo__ grouping respectively:
**Example 5.121. **
mi | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | be'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | (quickly | (walking |  | using | the | arms | )  
je | masno | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, both quickly walking using my arms and slowly.  
---  
  

**Example 5.122. **
mi | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | [be'o] | ke'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | ( | (quickly | (walking |  | using | the | arms | ) | )  
je | masno | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, both quickly walking using my arms and slowly.  
---  
  

However, if we place a __na'e__ at the beginning of the selbri in both Example 5.121 and Example 5.122, we get different results:
**Example 5.123. **
mi | na'e | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | be'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | ((non- | quickly) | (walking |  | using | the | arms | )  
je | masno | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, both walking using my arms other than quickly, and also slowly.  
---  
  

**Example 5.124. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | [be'o] | ke'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | (non | ( | quickly | (walking |  | using | the | arms) |  | )  
je | masno | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | the | market.  
I go to the market, both other than quickly walking using my arms, and also slowly.  
---  
  

The difference arises because the __na'e__ in Example 5.124 negates the whole construction from __ke__ to __ke'e__ , whereas in Example 5.123 it negates __sutra__ alone.
Beware of omitting terminators in these complex examples! If the explicit __ke'e__ is left out in Example 5.124, it is transformed into:
**Example 5.125. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | be'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | non- | ( | quickly | ((walking |  | using | the | arms) | )  
je | masno | klama | [ke'e] | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | slowly) | go-to | ) | the | market.  
I do something other than quickly both going to the market walking using my arms and slowly going to the market.  
---  
  

And if both __ke'e__ and __be'o__ are omitted, the results are even sillier:
**Example 5.126. **
mi | na'e | ke | sutra | cadzu | be | fi | le | birka | je | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | non | ( | quickly | walk |  | on-my | (the | arm-type | and | slow)  
klama | [be'o] | [ke'e] | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
goers |  | ) | on-the | market.  
I do something other than quickly walking using the goers, both arm-type and slow, relative-to the market.  
---  
  

In Example 5.126, everything after __be__ is a linked sumti, so the place structure is that of __cadzu__ , whose x2 place is the surface walked upon. It is less than clear what an “arm-type goer” might be. Furthermore, since the x3 place has been occupied by the linked sumti, the _le zarci_ following the selbri falls into the nonexistent x4 place of __cadzu__. As a result, the whole example, though grammatical, is complete nonsense. (The bracketed Lojban words appear where a fluent Lojbanist would understand them to be implied.)
Finally, it is also possible to place __na'e__ before a __gu'e__ … __gi__ logically connected tanru construction. The meaning of this usage has not yet been firmly established.

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  
I'm worn out by your continuous talking.  
---  
  

**Example 13.27. **
.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  
I'm putting you to bed.  
---  
  

**Example 13.28. **
.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.  
---  
  

**Example 13.29. **
.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  
I hope I feel better tomorrow!  
---  
  

**Example 13.30. **
.au | mi | sipna  
---|---|---  
[desire] | I | sleep.  
I want to sleep.  
---  
  

**Example 13.31. **
.a'ucu'i | do | pante  
---|---|---  
[no-interest] | you | complain.  
I have no interest in your complaints.  
---  
  

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  
I feel up to dealing with you.  
---  
  

**Example 13.34. **
.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  
I should fill the car's gas tank.  
---  
  

**Example 13.35. **
.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  
---|---|---|---  
[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  
Please take care of yourself!  
---  
  

**Example 13.36. **
.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  
I suggest going to the park.  
---  
  

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  
I can't believe you thought you could fool me.  
---  
  

**Example 13.38. **
do | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  
I blame you for not coming home.  
---  
  

**Example 13.39. **
.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  
le | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  
It's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  
---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  
---
