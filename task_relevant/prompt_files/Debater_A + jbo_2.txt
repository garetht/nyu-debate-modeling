Answer:=== SYSTEM PROMPT ===
The following are rules from the game of Debate.
- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.
- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.
- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.
- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.
- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.
- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.
You are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. 
  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.
  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. 
  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.

## 15.9. Affirmations
There is an explicit positive form for both selma'o NA (__ja'a__) and selma'o NAhE (__je'a__), each of which would supplant the corresponding negator in the grammatical position used, allowing one to assert the positive in response to a negative question or statement without confusion. Assuming the same context as in Section 15.8:
**Example 15.89. **
xu | na | go'i  
---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that | [false] | [repeat-previous]?  
  

or equivalently
**Example 15.90. **
xu | la | djan. | [cu] | na | pu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that: | that-named | John |  | [false] | previously  
klama | la | paris. | .e | la | rom.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
went-to | that-name | Paris | and | that-named | Rome.  
  

The obvious, but incorrect, positive response to this negative question is:
**Example 15.91. **
go'i  
---  
[repeat-previous]  
---  
  

A plain __go'i__ does not mean “Yes it is”; it merely abbreviates repeating the previous statement unmodified, including any negators present; and Example 15.91 actually states that it is false that John went to both Paris and Rome.
When considering:
**Example 15.92. **
na | go'i  
---|---  
[false] | [repeat-previous]  
  

as a response to a negative question like Example 15.90, Lojban designers had to choose between two equally plausible interpretations with opposite effects. Does Example 15.92 create a double negative in the sentence by adding a new __na__ to the one already there (forming a double negative and hence a positive statement), or does the __na__ replace the previous one, leaving the sentence unchanged?
It was decided that substitution, the latter alternative, is the preferable choice, since it is then clear whether we intend a positive or a negative sentence without performing any manipulations. This is the way English usually works, but not all languages work this way – Russian, Japanese, and Navajo all interpret a negative reply to a negative question as positive.
The positive assertion cmavo of selma'o NA, which is "ja'a", can also replace the __na__ in the context, giving:
**Example 15.93. **
ja'a | go'i  
---|---  
[true] | [repeat-previous]  
John did go to Paris and Rome.  
---  
  

__ja'a__ can replace __na__ in a similar manner wherever the latter is used:
**Example 15.94. **
mi | ja'a | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [true] | go-to | the | store  
I indeed go to the store.  
---  
  

__je'a__ can replace __na'e__ in exactly the same way, stating that scalar negation does not apply, and that the relation indeed holds as stated. In the absence of a negation context, it emphasizes the positive:
**Example 15.95. **
ta | je'a | melbi  
---|---|---  
that | is-indeed | beautiful.

## 8.2. Incidental relative clauses
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
noi |  NOI |  incidental relative clause introducer  
---|---|---  
There are two basic kinds of relative clauses: restrictive relative clauses introduced by __poi__ , and incidental (sometimes called simply “non-restrictive”) relative clauses introduced by __noi__. The difference between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide information that is essential to identifying the referent of the sumti to which they are attached, whereas incidental relative clauses provide additional information which is helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying the referent of the sumti. All of the examples in Section 8.1 are restrictive relative clauses: the information in the relative clause is essential to identification. (The title of this chapter, though, uses an incidental relative clause.)
Consider the following examples:
**Example 8.12. **
le | gerku | poi | blanu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which | is-blue |  | is-large.  
The dog which is blue is large.  
---  
  

**Example 8.13. **
le | gerku | noi | blanu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | incidentally-which | is-blue |  | is-large.  
The dog, which is blue, is large.  
---  
  

In Example 8.12, the information conveyed by _poi blanu_ is essential to identifying the dog in question: it restricts the possible referents from dogs in general to dogs that are blue. This is why __poi__ relative clauses are called restrictive. In Example 8.13, on the other hand, the dog which is referred to has presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative clause _noi blanu_ just provides additional information about it. (If in fact the dog hasn't been identified clearly, then the relative clause does not help identify it further.)
In English, the distinction between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is expressed in writing by surrounding incidental, but not restrictive, clauses with commas. These commas are functioning as parentheses, because incidental relative clauses are essentially parenthetical. This distinction in punctuation is represented in speech by a difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive relative clauses can be introduced by “that” as well as “which” and “who”, whereas incidental relative clauses cannot begin with “that”. Lojban, however, always uses the cmavo __poi__ and __noi__ rather than punctuation or intonation to make the distinction.
Here are more examples of incidental relative clauses:
**Example 8.14. **
mi | noi | pajni | cu | zvati  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | who-incidentally | am-a-judge |  | am-at | [some-place].  
I, a judge, am present.  
---  
  

In this example, __mi__ is already sufficiently restricted, and the additional information that I am a judge is being provided solely for the listener's edification.
**Example 8.15. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | karce | noi | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | car | incidentally-which | is-white.  
Do you see my car, which is white?  
---  
  

In Example 8.15, the speaker is presumed to have only one car, and is providing incidental information that it is white. (Alternatively, he or she might have more than one car, since _le karce_ can be plural, in which case the incidental information is that each of them is white.) Contrast Example 8.16 with a restrictive relative clause:
**Example 8.16. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | karce | poi | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | car | which | is-white.  
Do you see my car that is white?  
---  
Do you see my white car?  
  

Here the speaker probably has several cars, and is restricting the referent of the sumti _le mi karce_ (and thereby the listener's attention) to the white one only. Example 8.16 means much the same as Example 8.17, which does not use a relative clause:
**Example 8.17. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | blabi | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | white | car.  
Do you see my car, the white one?  
---  
  

So a restrictive relative clause attached to a description can often mean the same as a description involving a tanru. However, _blabi karce_ , like all tanru, is somewhat vague: in principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things, or even express some more complicated concept involving whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative clause of Example 8.16 can only refer to a car which is white, not to any more complex or extended concept.

## 14.13. Truth questions and connective questions
So far we have addressed only sentences which are statements. Lojban, like all human languages, needs also to deal with sentences which are questions. There are many ways of asking questions in Lojban, but some of these (like questions about quantity, tense, and emotion) are discussed in other chapters.
The simplest kind of question is of the type “Is it true that ...” where some statement follows. This type is called a “truth question”, and can be represented in English by Example 14.92:
**Example 14.92. **
Is it true that Fido is a dog?
Is Fido a dog?
  

Note the two formulations. English truth questions can always be formed by prefixing “Is is true that” to the beginning of a statement; there is also usually a more idiomatic way involving putting the verb before its subject. “Is Fido a dog?” is the truth question corresponding to “Fido is a dog”. In Lojban, the equivalent mechanism is to prefix the cmavo __xu__ (of selma'o UI) to the statement:
**Example 14.93. **
xu | la | faidon. | gerku  
---|---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that | that-named | Fido | is-a-dog?  
  

Example 14.92 and Example 14.93 are equivalent in meaning.
A truth question can be answered “yes” or “no”, depending on the truth or falsity, respectively, of the underlying statement. The standard way of saying “yes” in Lojban is __go'i__ and of saying “no” is __na__ __go'i__. (The reasons for this rule are explained in Section 7.6.) In answer to Example 14.93, the possible answers are:
**Example 14.94. **
go'i  
---  
Fido is a dog.  
---  
  

and
**Example 14.95. **
nago'i  
---  
Fido is not a dog.  
---  
  

Some English questions seemingly have the same form as the truth questions so far discussed. Consider
**Example 14.96. **
Is Fido a dog or a cat?
  

Superficially, Example 14.96 seems like a truth question with the underlying statement:
**Example 14.97. **
Fido is a dog or a cat.
  

By translating Example 14.97 into Lojban and prefixing __xu__ to signal a truth question, we get:
**Example 14.98. **
xu | la | faidon. | gerku | gi'onai | mlatu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that | that-named | Fido | is-a-dog | or | is-a-cat | (but not both)?  
  

Given that Fido really is either a dog or a cat, the appropriate answer would be __go'i__ ; if Fido were a fish, the appropriate answer would be __na__ __go'i__.
But that is not what an English-speaker who utters Example 14.96 is asking! The true significance of Example 14.96 is that the speaker desires to know the truth value of either of the two underlying bridi (it is presupposed that only one is true).
Lojban has an elegant mechanism for rendering this kind of question which is very unlike that used in English. Instead of asking about the truth value of the connected bridi, Lojban users ask about the truth function which connects them. This is done by using a special question cmavo: there is one of these for each of the logical connective selma'o, as shown by the following table:
ge'i |  GA |  forethought connective question  
---|---|---  
gi'i |  GIhA |  bridi-tail connective question  
gu'i |  GUhA |  tanru forethought connective question  
je'i |  JA |  tanru connective question  
ji |  A |  sumti connective question  
(This list unfortunately departs from the pretty regularity of the other cmavo for logical connection. The two-syllable selma'o, GIhA and GUhA, make use of the cmavo ending in “-i” which is not used for a truth function, but __gi__ and __i__ were not available, and different cmavo had to be chosen. This table must simply be memorized, like most other non-connective cmavo assignments.)
One correct translation of Example 14.96 employs a question gihek:
**Example 14.99. **
la | .alis. | gerku | gi'i | mlatu  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | is-a-dog | [truth-function?] | is-a-cat?  
  

Here are some plausible answers:
**Example 14.100. **
nagi'e  
---  
Alice is not a dog and is a cat.  
---  
  

**Example 14.101. **
gi'enai  
---  
Alice is a dog and is not a cat.  
---  
  

**Example 14.102. **
nagi'enai  
---  
Alice is not a dog and is not a cat.  
---  
  

**Example 14.103. **
nagi'o  
---  
gi'onai  
Alice is a dog or is a cat but not both (I'm not saying which).  
---  
  

Example 14.103 is correct but uncooperative.
As usual, Lojban questions are answered by filling in the blank left by the question. Here the blank is a logical connective, and therefore it is grammatical in Lojban to utter a bare logical connective without anything for it to connect.
The answer __gi'e__ , meaning that Alice is a dog and is a cat, is impossible in the real world, but for:
**Example 14.104. **
do | djica | tu'a | loi | ckafi  
---|---|---|---|---  
You | desire | something-about | a-mass-of | coffee  
ji | loi | tcati  
---|---|---  
[truth-function?] | a-mass-of | tea?  
Do you want coffee or tea?  
---  
  

the answer __e__ , meaning that I want both, is perfectly plausible, if not necessarily polite.
The forethought questions __ge'i__ and __gu'i__ are used like the others, but ambiguity forbids the use of isolated forethought connectives as answers – they sound like the start of forethought-connected bridi. So although Example 14.105 is the forethought version of Example 14.104:
**Example 14.105. **
do | djica | tu'a | ge'i | loi | ckafi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | desire | something-about | [truth-function?] | a-mass-of | coffee  
gi | loi | tcati  
---|---|---  
[or] | a-mass-of | tea?  
  

the answer must be in afterthought form.
There are natural languages, notably Chinese, which employ the Lojbanic form of connective question. The Chinese sentence
**Example 14.106. **
_ni 3 zou3 hai2shi pao3_  
---  
You walk [or?] run?  
  

means “Do you walk or run?”, and is exactly parallel to the Lojban:
**Example 14.107. **
do | cadzu | gi'i | bajra  
---|---|---|---  
You | walk | [or?] | run?  
  

However, Chinese does not use logical connectives in the reply to such a question, so the resemblance, though striking, is superficial.
Truth questions may be used in bridi connection. This form of sentence is perfectly legitimate, and can be interpreted by using the convention that a truth question is true if the answer is “yes” and false if the answer is __no__. Analogously, an imperative sentence (involving the special pro-sumti __ko__ , which means “you” but marks the sentence as a command) is true if the command is obeyed, and false otherwise. A request of Abraham Lincoln's may be translated thus:
**Example 14.108. **
ganai | ti | ckafi | gi | ko | bevri | loi | tcati | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
If | this | is-coffee | then | [you!] | bring | a-mass-of | tea | to-me,  
.ije | ganai | ti | tcati | gi | ko | bevri | loi | ckafi | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | if | this | is-tea | then | [you!] | bring | a-mass-of | coffee | to-me.  
If this is coffee, bring me tea; but if this is tea, bring me coffee.  
---  
  

In logical terms, however, “but” is the same as “and”; the difference is that the sentence after a “but” is felt to be in tension or opposition to the sentence before it. Lojban represents this distinction by adding the discursive cmavo __ku'i__ (of selma'o UI), which is explained in Section 13.12, to the logical __.i__ __je__.)

## 14.15. More about non-logical connectives
The final three JOI cmavo, __jo'e__ , __ku'a__ , and __pi'u__ , are probably only useful when talking explicitly about sets. They represent three standard set operators usually called “union”, “intersection”, and “cross product” (also known as “Cartesian product”). The union of two sets is a set containing all the members that are in either set; the intersection of two sets is a set containing all the members that are in both sets. The cross product of two sets is the set of all possible ordered pairs, where each ordered pair contains a single element from the first set followed by a single element from the second. This may seem very abstract; hopefully, the following examples will help:
**Example 14.125. **
lo'i | ricfu | ku | jo'e | lo'i | dotco | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-set-of | rich-things |  | union | the-set-of | German-things |  | is-large.  
  

**Example 14.126. **
lo'i | ricfu | ku | ku'a | lo'i | dotco | cu | cmalu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-set-of | rich-things |  | intersection | the-set-of | German-things |  | is-small.  
  

There is a parallelism between logic and set theory that makes Example 14.125 and Example 14.126 equivalent respectively to:
**Example 14.127. **
lo'i | ricfu | ja | dotco | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-set-of | (rich-things | or | German-things) |  | is-large.  
  

and
**Example 14.128. **
lo'i | ricfu | je | dotco | cu | cmalu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-set-of | (rich-things | and | German-things) |  | is-small.  
  

The following example uses _se remei_ , which is a set (not a mass) of two elements:
**Example 14.129. **
la | djeimyz. | ce[bo] | la | djordj. | pi'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | James | and-set | that-named | George | cross-product  
la | meris. | cebo | la | martas. | cu | prami | se | remei  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Mary | and-set | that-named | Martha |  | are-lover |  | type-of-pairs.  
  

means that each of the pairs James/Mary, George/Mary, James/Martha, and George/Martha love each other. Therefore it is similar in meaning to Example 14.121; however, that example speaks only of the men loving the women, not vice versa.
Joiks may be combined with __bo__ or with __ke__ in the same way as eks and jeks; this allows grouping of non-logical connections between sumti and tanru units, in complete parallelism with logical connections:
**Example 14.130. **
mi | joibo | do | ce | la | djan. | joibo | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(I | massed-with | you) | and | (that-named | John | massed-with | that-named | Jane)  
cu | gunma | se | remei  
---|---|---|---  
| are-a-mass |  | type-of-two-set  
  

asserts that there is a set of two items each of which is a mass.
Non-logical connection is permitted at the joint of a termset; this is useful for associating more than one sumti or tagged sumti with each side of the non-logical connection. The place structure of __casnu__ is:
> _ _casnu_ _ the mass x1 discusses/talks about x2
so the x1 place must be occupied by a mass (for reasons not explained here); however, different components of the mass may discuss in different languages. To associate each participant with his or her language, we can say:
**Example 14.131. **
mi | ce'e | bau | la | lojban. | pe'e | joi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(I | [plus] | in-language | that-named | Lojban | [joint] | massed-with  
do | ce'e | bau | la | gliban. | nu'u | casnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
you | [plus] | in-language | that-named | English | ) | discuss.  
  

Like all non-logical connectives, the usage shown in Example 14.131 cannot be mechanically converted into a non-logical connective placed at another location in the bridi. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.131 is:
**Example 14.132. **
nu'i joigi mi bau la lojban gi do bau la gliban. nu'u casnu
  

Non-logical forethought termsets are also useful when the things to be non-logically connected are sumti preceded with tense or modal (BAI) tags:
**Example 14.133. **
la | djan. | fa'u | la | frank. | cusku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | respectively-with | that-named | Frank | express  
nu'i | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---  
[start-termset] | in-language | that-named | Lojban  
nu'u | fa'u | bai  
---|---|---  
[joint] | respectively-with | under-compulsion-by  
tu'a | la | djordj. | [nu'u]  
---|---|---|---  
something-about | that-named | George. |   
John and Frank speak in Lojban and under George's compulsion, respectively.  
---  
  

Example 14.133 associates speaking in Lojban with John, and speaking under George's compulsion with Frank. We do not know what language Frank uses, or whether John speaks under anyone's compulsion.
Joiks may be prefixed with __i__ to produce ijoiks, which serve to non-logically connect sentences. The ijoik __.i__ __ce'o__ indicates that the event of the second bridi follows that of the first bridi in some way other than a time relationship (which is handled with a tense):
**Example 14.134. **
mi | ba | gasnu | la'e | di'e | .i  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | do | the-referent-of | the-following: |   
tu'e | kanji | lo | ni | cteki | .ice'o | lumci | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | Compute | the | quantity-of | taxes. | And-then | wash | the | car.  
.ice'o | dzukansa | le | gerku | tu'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
And-then | walkingly-accompany | the | dog. | )  
List of things to do: Figure taxes. Wash car. Walk dog.  
---  
  

Example 14.134 represents a list of things to be done in priority order. The order is important, hence the need for a sequence connective, but does not necessarily represent a time order (the dog may end up getting walked first). Note the use of __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ as general brackets around the whole list. This is related to, but distinct from, their use in Section 14.8, because there is no logical connective between the introductory phrase _mi ba gasnu la'edi'e_ and the rest. The brackets effectively show how large an utterance the word __di'e__ , which means “the following utterance”, refers to.
Similarly, __.i__ __joi__ is used to connect sentences that represent the components of a joint event such as a joint cause: the Lojban equivalent of “Fran hit her head and fell out of the boat, so that she drowned” would join the events “Fran hit her head” and “Fran fell out of the boat” with __.i__ __joi__.
The following __nai__ , if present, does not negate either of the things to be connected, but instead specifies that some other connection (logical or non-logical) is applicable: it is a scalar negation:
**Example 14.135. **
mi | jo'u | nai | do | cu | remei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | in-common-with | [not!] | you |  | are-a-twosome  
  

The result of _mi jo'u do_ would be two individuals, not a mass, therefore __jo'u__ is not applicable; __joi__ would be the correct connective.
There is no joik question cmavo as such; however, joiks and ijoiks may be uttered in isolation in response to a logical connective question, as in the following exchange:
**Example 14.136. **
do | djica | tu'a | loi | ckafi  
---|---|---|---|---  
You | desire | something-about | a-mass-of | coffee  
ji | loi | tcati  
---|---|---  
[what-connective?] | a-mass-of | tea?  
Do you want coffee or tea?  
---  
  

**Example 14.137. **
joi  
---  
Mixed-mass-and.  
Both as a mass (i.e, mixed together).  
---  
  

Ugh. (Or in Lojban: __.a'u__ __nai__ __sai__ __ro'o__.)

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---  
[exhaustion] | you | continuously | utter.  
I'm worn out by your continuous talking.  
---  
  

**Example 13.27. **
.ai | mi | benji | do | le | ckana  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[intent] | I | transfer | you | to-the | bed.  
I'm putting you to bed.  
---  
  

**Example 13.28. **
.a'i | mi | ba | gasnu | le | nu | do | cikna | binxo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[effort] | I | [future] | am-the-actor-in | the | event-of | you | awake-ly | become.  
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.  
---  
  

**Example 13.29. **
.a'o | mi | kanryze'a | ca | le | bavlamdei  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[hope] | I | am-health-increased | at-time | the | future-adjacent-day.  
I hope I feel better tomorrow!  
---  
  

**Example 13.30. **
.au | mi | sipna  
---|---|---  
[desire] | I | sleep.  
I want to sleep.  
---  
  

**Example 13.31. **
.a'ucu'i | do | pante  
---|---|---  
[no-interest] | you | complain.  
I have no interest in your complaints.  
---  
  

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  
I feel up to dealing with you.  
---  
  

**Example 13.34. **
.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  
I should fill the car's gas tank.  
---  
  

**Example 13.35. **
.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  
---|---|---|---  
[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  
Please take care of yourself!  
---  
  

**Example 13.36. **
.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  
I suggest going to the park.  
---  
  

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  
I can't believe you thought you could fool me.  
---  
  

**Example 13.38. **
do | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  
I blame you for not coming home.  
---  
  

**Example 13.39. **
.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  
le | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  
It's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  
---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  
---

## 7.15. lujvo based on pro-sumti
There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See Section 7.16 for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.
Thus __donta'a__ , meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted as _tavla be do_ , and would have the place structure
**Example 7.76. **
> t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
  

since `t2` (the addressee) is already known to be __do__.
On the other hand, the lujvo __donma'o__ , literally “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal pronoun”, would be interpreted as _cmavo be zo do_ , and have the place structure:
**Example 7.77. **
> c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
  

since both the `c2` place (the grammatical class) and the `c3` place (the meaning) are obvious from the context __do__.
An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the __fo'a__ series is to express lujvo which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An example would be:
**Example 7.78. **
fo'a | goi | le | kulnrsu,omi | .i | lo | fo'arselsanga  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x6 | stands-for | the | Finnish-culture | . | An | x6-song.  
  

Finally, lujvo involving __zi'o__ are also possible, and are fully discussed in Chapter 12. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for __zi'o__ as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a _se pinxe be zi'o_ , the lujvo corresponding to this is _zilrelselpinxe_ (deleting the second place of _se pinxe_). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that _zilpavypinxe_ has the same place structure as _zilrelselpinxe_ , and _lo zilpavypinxe_ , like _lo zilrelselpinxe_ , refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ , __du__ , and __bu'a__ also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for _du-_ based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.

## 8.6. Relative clauses and descriptors
So far, this chapter has described the various kinds of relative clauses (including relative phrases). The list is now complete, and the rest of the chapter will be concerned with the syntax of sumti that include relative clauses. So far, all relative clauses have appeared directly after the sumti to which they are attached. This is the most common position (and originally the only one), but a variety of other placements are also possible which produce a variety of semantic effects.
There are actually three places where a relative clause can be attached to a description sumti: after the descriptor (__le__ , __lo__ , or whatever), after the embedded selbri but before the elidable terminator (which is __ku__), and after the __ku__. The relative clauses attached to descriptors that we have seen have occupied the second position. Thus Example 8.43, if written out with all elidable terminators, would appear as:
**Example 8.47. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | ku'o | ku | cu | klama | vau  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | (dog | which | (is-white | ) | ) |  | goes | .  
The dog which is white is going.  
---  
  

Here __ku'o__ is the terminator paired with __poi__ and __ku__ with __le__ , and __vau__ is the terminator of the whole bridi.
When a simple descriptor using __le__ , like _le gerku_ , has a relative clause attached, it is purely a matter of style and emphasis where the relative clause should go. Therefore, the following examples are all equivalent in meaning to Example 8.47:
**Example 8.48. **
le | poi | blabi | ku'o | gerku | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | such-that-( | it-is-white | ) | dog |  | goes.  
  

**Example 8.49. **
le | gerku | ku | poi | blabi | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | (dog | ) | which | is-white |  | goes.  
  

Example 8.47 will seem most natural to speakers of languages like English, which always puts relative clauses after the noun phrases they are attached to; Example 8.48, on the other hand, may seem more natural to Finnish or Chinese speakers, who put the relative clause first. Note that in Example 8.48, the elidable terminator __ku'o__ must appear, or the selbri of the relative clause (__blabi__) will merge with the selbri of the description (__gerku__), resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. The purpose of the form appearing in Example 8.49 will be apparent shortly.
As is explained in detail in Section 6.7, two different numbers (known as the “inner quantifier” and the “outer quantifier”) can be attached to a description. The inner quantifier specifies how many things the descriptor refers to: it appears between the descriptor and the description selbri. The outer quantifier appears before the descriptor, and specifies how many of the things referred to by the descriptor are involved in this particular bridi. In the following example,
**Example 8.50. **
re |  | le | mu | prenu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | of | the | five | persons |  | go-to | the | market.  
Two of the five people [that I have in mind] are going to the market.  
---  
  

__mu__ is the inner quantifier and __re__ is the outer quantifier. Now what is meant by attaching a relative clause to the sumti _re le mu prenu_? Suppose the relative clause is _poi ninmu_ (meaning “who are women”). Now the three possible attachment points discussed previously take on significance.
**Example 8.51. **
re |  | le | poi | ninmu | ku'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | of | the | such-that([they] | are-women | )  
mu | prenu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
five | persons |  | go-to | the | market.  
Two women out of the five persons go to the market.  
---  
  

**Example 8.52. **
re |  | le | mu | prenu | poi | ninmu | [ku] | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two | of | the | (five | persons | which-( | are-women) | ) |  | go-to | the | market.  
Two of the five women go to the market.  
---  
  

**Example 8.53. **
re |  | le | mu | prenu | ku | poi | ninmu | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(Two | of | the | five | persons | ) | which-( | are-women | ) | go-to | the | market.  
Two women out of the five persons go to the market.  
---  
  

As the parentheses show, Example 8.52 means that all five of the persons are women, whereas Example 8.53 means that the two who are going to the market are women. How do we remember which is which? If the relative clause comes after the explicit __ku__ , as in Example 8.53, then the sumti as a whole is qualified by the relative clause. If there is no __ku__ , or if the relative clause comes before an explicit __ku__ , then the relative clause is understood to apply to everything which the underlying selbri applies to.
What about Example 8.51? By convention, it means the same as Example 8.53, and it requires no __ku__ , but it does typically require a __ku'o__ instead. Note that the relative clause comes before the inner quantifier.
When __le__ is the descriptor being used, and the sumti has no explicit outer quantifier, then the outer quantifier is understood to be __ro__ (meaning “all”), as is explained in Section 6.7. Thus _le gerku_ is taken to mean “all of the things I refer to as dogs”, possibly all one of them. In that case, there is no difference between a relative clause after the __ku__ or before it. However, if the descriptor is __lo__ , the difference is quite important:
**Example 8.54. **
lo | prenu | ku | noi | blabi | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(Some | persons | ) | incidentally-which-( | are-white | ) | go-to | the | market.  
Some people, who are white, go to the market.  
---  
  

**Example 8.55. **
lo | prenu | noi | blabi | [ku] | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Some | (persons | incidentally-which | are-white | ) |  | go | to-the | market.  
Some of the people, who by the way are white, go to the market.  
---  
  

Both Example 8.54 and Example 8.55 tell us that one or more persons are going to the market. However, they make very different incidental claims. Now, what does _lo prenu noi blabi_ mean? Well, the default inner quantifier is __ro__ (meaning “all”), and the default outer quantifier is __su'o__ (meaning “at least one”). Therefore, we must first take all persons, then choose at least one of them. That one or more people will be going.
In Example 8.54, the relative clause described the sumti once the outer quantifier was applied: one or more people, who are white, are going. But in Example 8.55, the relative clause actually describes the sumti before the outer quantification is applied, so that it ends up meaning “First take all persons – by the way, they're all white”. But not all people are white, so the incidental claim being made here is false.
The safe strategy, therefore, is to always use __ku__ when attaching a __noi__ relative clause to a __lo__ descriptor. Otherwise we may end up claiming far too much.
When the descriptor is __la__ , indicating that what follows is a selbri used for naming, then the positioning of relative clauses has a different significance. A relative clause inside the __ku__ , whether before or after the selbri, is reckoned part of the name; a relative clause outside the __ku__ is not. Therefore,
**Example 8.56. **
mi | viska | la | nanmu | poi | terpa | le | ke'a | xirma | [ku]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | that-named-( | man | which | fears | the | of-IT | horse | ).  
I see Man Afraid Of His Horse.  
---  
  

says that the speaker sees a person with a particular name, who does not necessarily fear any horses, whereas
**Example 8.57. **
mi | viska | la | nanmu | ku | poi | terpa | le | ke'a | xirma.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | that-named-( | Man | ) | which | fears | the | of-IT | horse.  
I see the person named “Man” who is afraid of his horse.  
---  
  

refers to one (or more) of those named “Man”, namely the one(s) who are afraid of their horses.
Finally, so-called indefinite sumti like _re karce_ , which means almost the same as _re lo karce_ (which in turn means the same as _re lo ro karce_), can have relative clauses attached; these are taken to be of the outside-the- __ku__ variety. Here is an example:
**Example 8.58. **
mi | ponse | re | karce | [ku] | poi | xekri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | two | cars |  | which-are | black.  
  

The restrictive relative clause only affects the two cars being affected by the main bridi, not all cars that exist. It is ungrammatical to try to place a relative clause within an indefinite sumti (that is, before an explicitly expressed terminating __ku__.) Use an explicit __lo__ instead.

## 9.9. Modal selbri
Consider the example:
**Example 9.55. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban  
bai | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
with-compeller | some-act-by | that-named | Frank.  
I speak in Lojban, under compulsion by Frank.  
---  
  

Example 9.55 has two modal sumti, using the modals __bau__ and __bai__. Suppose we wanted to specify the language explicitly but be vague about who's doing the compelling. We can simplify Example 9.55 to:
**Example 9.56. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban. | bai | [ku].  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban | under-compulsion |   
  

In Example 9.56, the elidable terminator __ku__ has taken the place of the sumti which would normally follow __bai__. Alternatively, we could specify the one who compels but keep the language vague:
**Example 9.57. **
mi | tavla | bau | [ku]  
---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-some-language |   
bai | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
under-compulsion-by | some-act-by | that-named | Frank.  
  

We are also free to move the modal-plus- __ku__ around the bridi:
**Example 9.58. **
bau | [ku] | bai | ku | mi | tavla  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
In-some-language |  | under-compulsion |  | I | speak.  
  

An alternative to using __ku__ is to place the modal cmavo right before the selbri, following the __cu__ which often appears there. When a modal is present, the __cu__ is almost never necessary.
**Example 9.59. **
mi | bai | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | compelledly | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

In this use, the modal is like a tanru modifier semantically, although grammatically it is quite distinct. Example 9.59 is very similar in meaning to:
**Example 9.60. **
mi | se bapli | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | compelledly | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

The __se__ conversion is needed because _bapli tavla_ would be a “compeller type of speaker” rather than a “compelled (by someone) type of speaker”, which is what a _bai tavla_ is.
If the modal preceding a selbri is constructed using __fi'o__ , then __fe'u__ is required to prevent the main selbri and the modal selbri from colliding:
**Example 9.61. **
mi | fi'o | kanla | fe'u | viska | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | with | eye |  | see | you.  
I see you with my eye(s).  
---  
  

There are two other uses of modals. A modal can be attached to a pair of bridi-tails that have already been connected by a logical, non-logical, or modal connection (see Chapter 14 for more on logical and non-logical connections):
**Example 9.62. **
mi | bai | ke | ge | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | under-compulsion | ( | both | go | to-the | market  
gi | cadzu | le | bisli | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk | on-the | ice | ).  
Under compulsion, I both go to the market and walk on the ice.  
---  
  

Here the __bai__ is spread over both _klama le zarci_ and _cadzu le bisli_ , and the _ge ... gi_ represents the logical connection “both-and” between the two.
Similarly, a modal can be attached to multiple sentences that have been combined with __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ , which are explained in more detail in Section 19.2:
**Example 9.63. **
bai | tu'e | mi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Under-compulsion | [start] | I | go | to-the | market.  
.i | mi | cadzu | le | bisli | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| I | walk | on-the | ice | [end].  
  

means the same thing as Example 9.62.
Note: Either BAI modals or _fi'o-_ plus-selbri modals may correctly be used in any of the constructions discussed in this section.

{
    "answer": "Your final answer here",
