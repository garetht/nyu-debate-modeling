Answer:=== SYSTEM PROMPT ===
The following are rules from the game of Debate.
- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.
- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.
- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.
- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.
- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.
- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.
You are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. 
  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.
  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. 
  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.

## 10.5. Interval sizes: VEhA and ZEhA
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ve'i |  VEhA |  short space interval  
---|---|---  
ve'a |  VEhA |  medium space interval  
ve'u |  VEhA |  long space interval  
ze'i |  ZEhA |  short time interval  
ze'a |  ZEhA |  medium time interval  
ze'u |  ZEhA |  long time interval  
So far, we have considered only events that are usually thought of as happening at a particular point in space and time: a man biting a dog at a specified place and time. But Lojbanic events may be much more “spread out” than that: _mi vasxu_ (I breathe) is something which is true during the whole of my life from birth to death, and over the entire part of the earth where I spend my life. The cmavo of VEhA (for space) and ZEhA (for time) can be added to any of the tense constructs we have already studied to specify the size of the space or length of the time over which the bridi is claimed to be true.
**Example 10.23. **
le | verba | ve'i | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | child | [small-space-interval] | walks-on | the | ice.  
In a small space, the child walks on the ice.  
---  
The child walks about a small area of the ice.  
  

means that her walking was done in a small area. Like the distances, the interval sizes are classified only roughly as “small, medium, large”, and are relative to the context: a small part of a room might be a large part of a table in that room.
Here is an example using a time interval:
**Example 10.24. **
le | verba | ze'a | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | child | [medium-time-interval] | walks-on | the | ice.  
For a medium time, the child walks/walked/will walk on the ice.  
---  
  

Note that with no time direction word, Example 10.24 does not say when the walking happened: that would be determined by context. It is possible to specify both directions or distances and an interval, in which case the interval always comes afterward:
**Example 10.25. **
le | verba | pu | ze'a | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | child | [past] | [medium-time-interval] | walks-on | the | ice.  
For a medium time, the child walked on the ice.  
---  
The child walked on the ice for a while.  
  

In Example 10.25, the relationship of the interval to the specified point in time or space is indeterminate. Does the interval start at the point, end at the point, or is it centered on the point? By adding an additional direction cmavo after the interval, this question can be conclusively answered:
**Example 10.26. **
mi | ca | ze'ica | cusku | dei  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | [short-time-interval-present] | express | this-utterance.  
I am now saying this sentence.  
---  
  

means that for an interval starting a short time in the past and extending to a short time in the future, I am expressing the utterance which is Example 10.26. Of course, “short” is relative, as always in tenses. Even a long sentence takes up only a short part of a whole day; in a geological context, the era of _Homo sapiens_ would only be a __ze'i__ interval.
By contrast,
**Example 10.27. **
mi | ca | ze'ipu | cusku | dei  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | [short-time-interval-past] | express | this-utterance.  
I have just been saying this sentence.  
---  
  

means that for a short time interval extending from the past to the present I have been expressing Example 10.27. Here the imaginary journey starts at the present, lays down one end point of the interval, moves into the past, and lays down the other endpoint. Another example:
**Example 10.28. **
mi | pu | ze'aba | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [medium-time-interval-future] | eat | the | of-me | meal.  
For a medium time afterward, I ate my meal.  
---  
I ate my meal for a while.  
  

With __ca__ instead of __ba__ , Example 10.28 becomes Example 10.29,
**Example 10.29. **
mi | pu | ze'aca | citka | le | mi | sanmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | [medium-time-interval-present] | eat | the | of-me | meal.  
For a medium time before and afterward, I ate my meal.  
---  
I ate my meal for a while.  
  

because the interval would then be centered on the past moment rather than oriented toward the future of that moment. The colloquial English translations are the same – English is not well-suited to representing this distinction.
Here are some examples of the use of space intervals with and without specified directions:
**Example 10.30. **
ta | ri'u | ve'i | finpe  
---|---|---|---  
That-there | [right] | [short-space-interval] | is-a-fish.  
That thing on my right is a fish.  
---  
  

In Example 10.30, there is no equivalent in the colloquial English translation of the “small interval” which the fish occupies. Neither the Lojban nor the English expresses the orientation of the fish. Compare Example 10.31:
**Example 10.31. **
ta | ri'u | ve'ica'u | finpe  
---|---|---|---  
That-there | [right] | [short-space-interval-front] | is-a-fish.  
That thing on my right extending forwards is a fish.  
---  
  

Here the space interval occupied by the fish extends from a point on my right to another point in front of the first point.

## 2.16. Indicators
Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. “Aha!”, “Oh no!”, “Ouch!”, “Aahh!”, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.
Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left. For example:
**Example 2.79. **
.ie |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Agreement! |  I |  - |  go.  
Yep! I'll go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.80. **
.ei |  mi |  [cu] |  klama  
---|---|---|---  
Obligation! |  I |  - |  go.  
I should go.  
---  
  

**Example 2.81. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  le melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go |  to-the beautiful-thing  
.ui |  [ku]  
---|---  
and I am happy because it is the beautiful thing I'm going to |  -  
  

Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison, the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means “and”.
**Example 2.82. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  You |  - |  stay.  
  

**Example 2.83. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ji'a |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  In addition, |  you |  - |  stay. |  added weight  
  

**Example 2.84. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  .i |  ku'i |  do |  [cu] |  stali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  go. |  |  However, |  you |  - |  stay. |  contrast  
  

Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”. Evidentials show the speaker's relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include __za'a__ (I directly observe the relationship), __pe'i__ (I believe that the relationship holds), __ru'a__ (I postulate the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.
**Example 2.85. **
pe'i |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I opine! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.  
  

**Example 2.86. **
za'a |  do |  [cu] |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
I directly observe! |  You |  - |  are beautiful.

## 2.11. Examples of brivla
The simplest form of selbri is an individual word. A word which may by itself express a selbri relation is called a __brivla__. The three types of brivla are gismu (root words), lujvo (compounds), and fu'ivla (borrowings from other languages). All have identical grammatical uses. So far, most of our selbri have been gismu or tanru built from gismu.
gismu:
**Example 2.46. **
mi |  [cu] |  klama |  ti |  zo'e |  zo'e |  ta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go-er |  - |  goes |  destination |  origin |  route |  means.  
I go here (to this) using that means (from somewhere via some route).  
---  
  

lujvo:
**Example 2.47. **
ta |  [cu] |  blari'o  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  is-blue-green.  
  

fu'ivla:
**Example 2.48. **
ti |  [cu] |  djarspageti  
---|---|---  
This |  - |  is-spaghetti.  
  

Some cmavo may also serve as selbri, acting as variables that stand for another selbri. The most commonly used of these is __go'i__ , which represents the main bridi of the previous Lojban sentence, with any new sumti or other sentence features being expressed replacing the previously expressed ones. Thus, in this context:
**Example 2.49. **
ta |  [cu] |  go'i  
---|---|---  
That |  - |  too/same-as-last selbri.  
That (is spaghetti), too.  
---

## 7.10. Relativized pro-sumti: _ke'a_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ke'a |  KOhA |  relativized sumti  
---|---|---  
This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in Chapter 8) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
**Example 7.69. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi | [zo'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a |  | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---|---  
makes | the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | from | some-mass-of | plastic.  
I see a cat made of plastic.  
---  
  

If __ke'a__ were omitted from Example 7.69, it might be confused with:
**Example 7.70. **
mi | catlu | lo | mlatu | poi  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | a | cat | such-that  
[ke'a] | zbasu | lei | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
the-thing-being-relativized-[the-cat] | makes | a-mass-of | plastic  
I see a cat that makes plastic.  
---  
  

The anaphora cmavo __ri__ cannot be used in place of __ke'a__ in Example 7.69 and Example 7.70, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the __ke'a__ appears.
Note that __ke'a__ is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, __ke'a__ may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see Section 8.10).

## 14.10. Multiple compound bridi
Giheks can be combined with __bo__ in the same way as eks:
**Example 14.60. **
mi | nelci | la | djan. | gi'e | nelci | la | martas. | gi'abo | nelci | la | meris.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.39 and Example 14.40. Likewise, __ke__ … __ke'e__ grouping can be used after giheks:
**Example 14.61. **
mi | dzukla | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | walk-to | the | market  
gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | house,  
gi'a | ke | dzukla | le | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---  
or | ( | walk-to | the | school  
gi'e | dzukla | le | briju | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk-to | the | office. | )  
  

is the gihek version of Example 14.47. The same rule about using __ke__ … __ke'e__ bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in Example 14.61 cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
**Example 14.62. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | to-that-named | John,  
.inaja | mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | I | give | the | book | to-that-named | John  
.ijabo | mi | lebna | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | I | take | the | book | from-that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to:
**Example 14.63. **
| mi | dejni | lo | rupnu | nagi'a | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[If] | I | owe | some | currency-units | then | (give  
gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta | vau | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
or | take) |  | a | book |  | to/from-that-named | John.  
  

The literal English translation in Example 14.63 is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. __mi__ fills the x1 place of all three selbri; _lo rupnu_ is the x2 of __dejni__ , whereas _le cukta_ is a tail-term shared between __dunda__ and __lebna__ ; _la djan._ is a tail-term shared by __dejni__ and by _dunda gi'abo lebna_. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving _la djan._ to the beginning of the sentence, as in Example 14.53:
**Example 14.64. **
fi | la | djan. |  | fa | mi | dejni | lo | rupnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
To/from | that-named | John, | [if] |  | I | owe | some | currency-units  
nagi'a |  | dunda | gi'abo | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [I] | give | or | take |  | the | book.  
  

Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
**Example 14.65. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | go-to | the | market | and | like | that-named | John.  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 14.50.
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
**Example 14.66. **
mi | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi'e | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (go | to-the | market | and | walk | to-the | house)  
gi | nelci | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
and | like | that-named | John.  
  

The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing __na__ :
**Example 14.67. **
| mi | na | ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[False!] | I |  | both | go-to | the | market | and | walk-to | the | house.  
  

Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of Example 14.54 is:
**Example 14.68. **
mi | ge | dunda | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | both | (give | the | book)  
gi | lebna | lo | rupnu | vau | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | (take | some | currency-units | ) | to/from-you.  
  

Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of Example 14.57:
**Example 14.69. **
ge | klama | le | zarci | gi | dzukla | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Both | a-goer | to-the | market | and | a-walker | to-the | office.  
  

Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and unshared terms before their selbri:
**Example 14.70. **
mi | gonai | le | zarci | cu | klama | gi | le | bisli | cu | dansu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | either-but-not-both | to-the | office |  | go | or | on-the | ice |  | dance.  
I either go to the office or dance on the ice (but not both).

## 5.9. Other kinds of simple selbri
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
go'i |  GOhA |  repeats the previous bridi  
---|---|---  
du |  GOhA |  equality  
nu'a |  NUhA |  math operator to selbri  
moi |  MOI |  changes number to ordinal selbri  
mei |  MOI |  changes number to cardinal selbri  
nu |  NU |  event abstraction  
kei |  KEI |  terminator for NU  
So far we have only discussed brivla and tanru built up from brivla as possible selbri. In fact, there are a few other constructions in Lojban which are grammatically equivalent to brivla: they can be used either directly as selbri, or as components in tanru. Some of these types of simple selbri are discussed at length in Chapter 7, Chapter 11, and Chapter 18; but for completeness these types are mentioned here with a brief explanation and an example of their use in selbri.
The cmavo of selma'o GOhA (with one exception) serve as pro-bridi, providing a reference to the content of other bridi; none of them has a fixed meaning. The most commonly used member of GOhA is probably __go'i__ , which amounts to a repetition of the previous bridi, or part of it. If I say:
**Example 5.89. **
la | djan. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | goes-to | the | market.  
  

you may retort:
**Example 5.90. **
la | djan. | go'i | troci  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [repeat-last] | are-a-trier.  
John tries to.  
---  
  

Example 5.90 is short for:
**Example 5.91. **
la | djan. | klama | be | le | zarci | be'o |  | troci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | is-a-goer | ( | to-the | market | ) | type-of | trier.  
  

because the whole bridi of Example 5.89 has been packaged up into the single word __go'i__ and inserted into Example 5.90.
The exceptional member of GOhA is __du__ , which represents the relation of identity. Its place structure is:
> x1 is identical with x2, x3, ...
for as many places as are given. More information on selma'o GOhA is available in Chapter 7.
Lojban mathematical expressions (mekso) can be incorporated into selbri in two different ways. Mathematical operators such as __su'i__ , meaning “plus”, can be transformed into selbri by prefixing them with __nu'a__ (of selma'o NUhA). The resulting place structure is:
> x1 is the result of applying (the operator) to arguments x2, x3, etc.
for as many arguments as are required. (The result goes in the x1 place because the number of following places may be indefinite.) For example:
**Example 5.92. **
li | vo | nu'a su'i | li | re | li | re  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | 4 | is-the-sum-of | the-number | 2 | and-the-number | 2.  
  

A possible tanru example might be:
**Example 5.93. **
mi | jimpe | tu'a | loi | nu'a su'i | nabmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | understand | something-about | the-mass-of | is-the-sum-of | problems.  
I understand addition problems.  
---  
  

More usefully, it is possible to combine a mathematical expression with a cmavo of selma'o MOI to create one of various numerical selbri. Details are available in Section 18.11. Here are a few tanru:
**Example 5.94. **
la | prim. | palvr. | pamoi | cusku  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Preem | Palver | is-the-1-th | speaker.  
Preem Palver is the first speaker.  
---  
  

**Example 5.95. **
la | an,iis. | joi | la | .asun.  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Anyi | massed-with | that-named | Asun  
bruna | remei  
---|---  
are-a-brother | type-of-twosome.  
Anyi and Asun are two brothers.  
---  
  

Finally, an important type of simple selbri which is not a brivla is the abstraction. Grammatically, abstractions are simple: a cmavo of selma'o NU, followed by a bridi, followed by the elidable terminator __kei__ of selma'o KEI. Semantically, abstractions are an extremely subtle and powerful feature of Lojban whose full ramifications are documented in Chapter 11. A few examples:
**Example 5.96. **
ti | nu | zdile | kei | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-an-event-of | amusement |  | room.  
This is an amusement room.  
---  
  

Example 5.96 is quite distinct in meaning from:
**Example 5.97. **
ti | zdile | kumfa  
---|---|---  
This | is-an-amuser | room.  
  

which suggests the meaning “a room that amuses someone”.

## 11.10. Lojban sumti raising
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
tu'a |  LAhE |  an abstraction involving  
---|---|---  
jai |  JAI |  abstraction conversion  
It is sometimes inconvenient, in a situation where an abstract description is logically required, to express the abstraction. In English we can say:
**Example 11.64. **
I try to open the door.
  

which in Lojban is:
**Example 11.65. **
mi | troci | le | nu | [mi] | gasnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | try | the | event-of | (I | am-agent-in  
le | nu | le | vorme | cu | karbi'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | (the | door |  | open-becomes)).  
  

which has an abstract description within an abstract description, quite a complex structure. In English (but not in all other languages), we may also say:
**Example 11.66. **
I try the door.
  

where it is understood that what I try is actually not the door itself, but the act of opening it. The same simplification can be done in Lojban, but it must be marked explicitly using a cmavo. The relevant cmavo is __tu'a__ , which belongs to selma'o LAhE. The Lojban equivalent of Example 11.66 is:
**Example 11.67. **
mi | troci | tu'a | le | vorme  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | try | some-action-to-do-with | the | door.  
  

The term “sumti-raising”, as in the title of this section, signifies that a sumti which logically belongs within an abstraction (or even within an abstraction which is itself inside an intermediate abstraction) is “raised” to the main bridi level. This transformation from Example 11.65 to Example 11.67 loses information: nothing except convention tells us what the abstraction was.
Using __tu'a__ is a kind of laziness: it makes speaking easier at the possible expense of clarity for the listener. The speaker must be prepared for the listener to respond something like:
**Example 11.68. **
tu'a | le | vorme | lu'u | ki'a  
---|---|---|---|---  
something-to-do-with | the | door | [terminator] | [confusion!]  
  

which indicates that _tu'a le vorme_ cannot be understood. (The terminator for __tu'a__ is __lu'u__ , and is used in Example 11.68 to make clear just what is being questioned: the sumti-raising, rather than the word __vorme__ as such.) An example of a confusing raised sumti might be:
**Example 11.69. **
tu'a | la | djan. | cu | cafne  
---|---|---|---|---  
something-to-do-with | that-named | John |  | frequently-occurs  
  

This must mean that something which John does, or which happens to John, occurs frequently: but without more context there is no way to figure out what. Note that without the __tu'a__ , Example 11.69 would mean that John considered as an event frequently occurs – in other words, that John has some sort of on-and-off existence! Normally we do not think of people as events in English, but the x1 place of __cafne__ is an event, and if something that does not seem to be an event is put there, the Lojbanic listener will attempt to construe it as one. (Of course, this analysis assumes that _djan._ is the name of a person, and not the name of some event.)
Logically, a counterpart of some sort is needed to __tu'a__ which transposes an abstract sumti into a concrete one. This is achieved at the selbri level by the cmavo __jai__ (of selma'o JAI). This cmavo has more than one function, discussed in Section 9.12 and Section 10.22; for the purposes of this chapter, it operates as a conversion of selbri, similarly to the cmavo of selma'o SE. This conversion changes
**Example 11.70. **
tu'a | mi | rinka | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
something-to-do-with | me | causes | the | event-of | you | are-dead  
My action causes your death.  
---  
  

into
**Example 11.71. **
mi | jai | rinka | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-associated-with | causing | the | event-of | your | death.  
I cause your death.  
---  
  

In English, the subject of “cause” can either be the actual cause (an event), or else the agent of the cause (a person, typically); not so in Lojban, where the x1 of __rinka__ is always an event. Example 11.70 and Example 11.71 look equally convenient (or inconvenient), but in making descriptions, Example 11.71 can be altered to:
**Example 11.72. **
le | jai | rinka | be | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-which-is | associated-with | causing | ( | the | event-of | your | death | )  
the one who caused your death  
---  
  

because __jai__ modifies the selbri and can be incorporated into the description – not so for __tu'a__.
The weakness of __jai__ used in descriptions in this way is that it does not specify which argument of the implicit abstraction is being raised into the x1 place of the description selbri. One can be more specific by using the modal form of __jai__ explained in Section 9.12:
**Example 11.73. **
le | jai gau | rinka | be | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-which-is | agent-in | causing | ( | the | event-of | your | death | )

(B) ze'a lo nicte lo ckuliki cu nerkla troci

Exactly one of the answers above is correct. Please indicate the single letter corresponding to the correct answer (A or B).
Answer:

Debater_B will defend the position that the answer is "ze'a lo nicte lo ckuliki cu troci nerkla".
Debater_A will defend the position that the answer is "ze'a lo nicte lo ckuliki cu nerkla troci".


You are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. 
- You should defend your position that the answer is "ze'a lo nicte lo ckuliki cu nerkla troci" while attacking Debater_B's position. 


Exactly one of the answers above is correct. Please provide your response in JSON format, including an 'answer' (A or B) field for the final result and a 'cot' (chain of thought) field explaining your reasoning

**IMPORTANT:** All quotes used in your `cot` field MUST be enclosed within <quote></quote> tags.
