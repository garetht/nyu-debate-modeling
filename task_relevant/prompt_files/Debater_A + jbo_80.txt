Answer:=== SYSTEM PROMPT ===
The following are rules from the game of Debate.
- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.
- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.
- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.
- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.
- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.
- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.
You are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. 
  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.
  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. 
  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.

## 15.9. Affirmations
There is an explicit positive form for both selma'o NA (__ja'a__) and selma'o NAhE (__je'a__), each of which would supplant the corresponding negator in the grammatical position used, allowing one to assert the positive in response to a negative question or statement without confusion. Assuming the same context as in Section 15.8:
**Example 15.89. **
xu | na | go'i  
---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that | [false] | [repeat-previous]?  
  

or equivalently
**Example 15.90. **
xu | la | djan. | [cu] | na | pu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that: | that-named | John |  | [false] | previously  
klama | la | paris. | .e | la | rom.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
went-to | that-name | Paris | and | that-named | Rome.  
  

The obvious, but incorrect, positive response to this negative question is:
**Example 15.91. **
go'i  
---  
[repeat-previous]  
---  
  

A plain __go'i__ does not mean “Yes it is”; it merely abbreviates repeating the previous statement unmodified, including any negators present; and Example 15.91 actually states that it is false that John went to both Paris and Rome.
When considering:
**Example 15.92. **
na | go'i  
---|---  
[false] | [repeat-previous]  
  

as a response to a negative question like Example 15.90, Lojban designers had to choose between two equally plausible interpretations with opposite effects. Does Example 15.92 create a double negative in the sentence by adding a new __na__ to the one already there (forming a double negative and hence a positive statement), or does the __na__ replace the previous one, leaving the sentence unchanged?
It was decided that substitution, the latter alternative, is the preferable choice, since it is then clear whether we intend a positive or a negative sentence without performing any manipulations. This is the way English usually works, but not all languages work this way – Russian, Japanese, and Navajo all interpret a negative reply to a negative question as positive.
The positive assertion cmavo of selma'o NA, which is "ja'a", can also replace the __na__ in the context, giving:
**Example 15.93. **
ja'a | go'i  
---|---  
[true] | [repeat-previous]  
John did go to Paris and Rome.  
---  
  

__ja'a__ can replace __na__ in a similar manner wherever the latter is used:
**Example 15.94. **
mi | ja'a | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [true] | go-to | the | store  
I indeed go to the store.  
---  
  

__je'a__ can replace __na'e__ in exactly the same way, stating that scalar negation does not apply, and that the relation indeed holds as stated. In the absence of a negation context, it emphasizes the positive:
**Example 15.95. **
ta | je'a | melbi  
---|---|---  
that | is-indeed | beautiful.

## 8.2. Incidental relative clauses
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
noi |  NOI |  incidental relative clause introducer  
---|---|---  
There are two basic kinds of relative clauses: restrictive relative clauses introduced by __poi__ , and incidental (sometimes called simply “non-restrictive”) relative clauses introduced by __noi__. The difference between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide information that is essential to identifying the referent of the sumti to which they are attached, whereas incidental relative clauses provide additional information which is helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying the referent of the sumti. All of the examples in Section 8.1 are restrictive relative clauses: the information in the relative clause is essential to identification. (The title of this chapter, though, uses an incidental relative clause.)
Consider the following examples:
**Example 8.12. **
le | gerku | poi | blanu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which | is-blue |  | is-large.  
The dog which is blue is large.  
---  
  

**Example 8.13. **
le | gerku | noi | blanu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | incidentally-which | is-blue |  | is-large.  
The dog, which is blue, is large.  
---  
  

In Example 8.12, the information conveyed by _poi blanu_ is essential to identifying the dog in question: it restricts the possible referents from dogs in general to dogs that are blue. This is why __poi__ relative clauses are called restrictive. In Example 8.13, on the other hand, the dog which is referred to has presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative clause _noi blanu_ just provides additional information about it. (If in fact the dog hasn't been identified clearly, then the relative clause does not help identify it further.)
In English, the distinction between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is expressed in writing by surrounding incidental, but not restrictive, clauses with commas. These commas are functioning as parentheses, because incidental relative clauses are essentially parenthetical. This distinction in punctuation is represented in speech by a difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive relative clauses can be introduced by “that” as well as “which” and “who”, whereas incidental relative clauses cannot begin with “that”. Lojban, however, always uses the cmavo __poi__ and __noi__ rather than punctuation or intonation to make the distinction.
Here are more examples of incidental relative clauses:
**Example 8.14. **
mi | noi | pajni | cu | zvati  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | who-incidentally | am-a-judge |  | am-at | [some-place].  
I, a judge, am present.  
---  
  

In this example, __mi__ is already sufficiently restricted, and the additional information that I am a judge is being provided solely for the listener's edification.
**Example 8.15. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | karce | noi | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | car | incidentally-which | is-white.  
Do you see my car, which is white?  
---  
  

In Example 8.15, the speaker is presumed to have only one car, and is providing incidental information that it is white. (Alternatively, he or she might have more than one car, since _le karce_ can be plural, in which case the incidental information is that each of them is white.) Contrast Example 8.16 with a restrictive relative clause:
**Example 8.16. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | karce | poi | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | car | which | is-white.  
Do you see my car that is white?  
---  
Do you see my white car?  
  

Here the speaker probably has several cars, and is restricting the referent of the sumti _le mi karce_ (and thereby the listener's attention) to the white one only. Example 8.16 means much the same as Example 8.17, which does not use a relative clause:
**Example 8.17. **
xu | do | viska | le | mi | blabi | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True?] | You | see |  | my | white | car.  
Do you see my car, the white one?  
---  
  

So a restrictive relative clause attached to a description can often mean the same as a description involving a tanru. However, _blabi karce_ , like all tanru, is somewhat vague: in principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things, or even express some more complicated concept involving whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative clause of Example 8.16 can only refer to a car which is white, not to any more complex or extended concept.

## 18.9. Approximation and inexact numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ji'i |  PA |  approximately  
---|---|---  
su'e |  PA |  at most  
su'o |  PA |  at least  
me'i |  PA |  less than  
za'u |  PA |  more than  
The cmavo __ji'i__ (of selma'o PA) is used in several ways to indicate approximate or rounded numbers. If it appears at the beginning of a number, the whole number is approximate:
**Example 18.60. **
ji'i | vo | no  
---|---|---  
approximation | four | zero  
approximately 40  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears in the middle of a number, all the digits following it are approximate:
**Example 18.61. **
vo | no | ji'i | mu | no  
---|---|---|---|---  
four | zero | approximation | five | zero  
roughly 4050 (where the “four thousand” is exact, but the “fifty” is approximate)  
---  
  

If __ji'i__ appears at the end of a number, it indicates that the number has been rounded. In addition, it can then be followed by a sign cmavo (__ma'u__ or __ni'u__), which indicate truncation towards positive or negative infinity respectively.
**Example 18.62. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation  
2.72 (rounded)  
---  
  

**Example 18.63. **
re | pi | ze | re | ji'i | ma'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | two | approximation | positive-sign  
2.72 (rounded up)  
---  
  

**Example 18.64. **
re | pi | ze | pa | ji'i | ni'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
two | point | seven | one | approximation | negative-sign  
2.71 (rounded down)  
---  
  

Example 18.62 through Example 18.64 are all approximations to __te'o__ (exponential e). __ji'i__ can also appear by itself, in which case it means “approximately the typical value in this context”.
The four cmavo __su'e__ , __su'o__ , __me'i__ , and __za'u__ , also of selma'o PA, express inexact numbers with upper or lower bounds:
**Example 18.65. **
mi | catlu | su'e | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-most | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.66. **
mi | catlu | su'o | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.67. **
mi | catlu | me'i | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | less-than | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.68. **
mi | catlu | za'u | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | more-than | two | persons  
  

Each of these is a subtly different claim: Example 18.66 is true of two or any greater number, whereas Example 18.68 requires three persons or more. Likewise, Example 18.65 refers to zero, one, or two; Example 18.67 to zero or one. (Of course, when the context allows numbers other than non-negative integers, _me'i re_ can be any number less than 2, and likewise with the other cases.) The exact quantifier, “exactly 2, neither more nor less” is just __re__. Note that _su'ore_ is the exact Lojban equivalent of English plurals.
If no number follows one of these cmavo, __pa__ is understood: therefore,
**Example 18.69. **
mi | catlu | su'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | at-least-[one] | person  
  

is a meaningful claim.
Like the numbers in Section 18.8, all of these cmavo may be preceded by __pi__ to make the corresponding quantifiers for part of a whole. For example, __pisu'o__ means “at least some part of”. The quantifiers __ro__ , __su'o__ , __piro__ , and __pisu'o__ are particularly important in Lojban, as they are implicitly used in the descriptions introduced by the cmavo of selma'o LA and LE, as explained in Section 6.7. Descriptions in general are outside the scope of this chapter.

## 6.6. Quantified sumti
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ro |  PA |  all of/each of  
---|---|---  
su'o |  PA |  at least (one of)  
Quantifiers tell us how many: in the case of quantifiers with sumti, how many things we are talking about. In Lojban, quantifiers are expressed by numbers and mathematical expressions: a large topic discussed in some detail in Chapter 18. For the purposes of this chapter, a simplified treatment will suffice. Our examples will employ either the simple Lojban numbers __pa__ , __re__ , __ci__ , __vo__ , and __mu__ , meaning “one”, “two”, “three”, “four”, “five” respectively, or else one of four special quantifiers, two of which are discussed in this section and listed above. These four quantifiers are important because every Lojban sumti has either one or two of them implicitly present in it – which one or two depends on the particular kind of sumti. There is more explanation of implicit quantifiers later in this section. (The other two quantifiers, __piro__ and __pisu'o__ , are explained in Section 6.7.)
Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit quantifier. The purpose of this quantifier is to specify how many of the things referred to by the sumti are being talked about. Here are some simple examples contrasting sumti with and without explicit quantifiers:
**Example 6.30. **
do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---  
You | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

**Example 6.31. **
re | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
Two-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

The difference between Example 6.30 and Example 6.31 is the presence of the explicit quantifier __re__ in the latter example. Although __re__ by itself means “two”, when used as a quantifier it means “two-of”. Out of the group of listeners (the number of which isn't stated), two (we are not told which ones) are asserted to be “walkers on the ice”. Implicitly, the others (if any) are not walkers on the ice. In Lojban, you cannot say “I own three shoes” if in fact you own four shoes. Numbers need never be specified, but if they are specified they must be correct.
(This rule does not mean that there is no way to specify a number which is vague. The sentence
**Example 6.32. **
mi | ponse | su'o | ci | cutci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | at-least | three | shoes.  
  

is true if you own three shoes, or four, or indeed any larger number. More details on vague numbers appear in the discussion of mathematical expressions in Chapter 18.)
Now consider Example 6.30 again. How many of the listeners are claimed to walk on the ice? The answer turns out to be: all of them, however many that is. So Example 6.30 and Example 6.33:
**Example 6.33. **
ro | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
All-of | you | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

turn out to mean exactly the same thing. This is a safe strategy, because if one of my listeners doesn't turn out to be walking on the ice, I can safely claim that I didn't intend that person to be a listener! And in fact, all of the personal pro-sumti such as __mi__ and __mi'o__ and __ko__ obey the same rule. We say that personal pro-sumti have a so-called “implicit quantifier” of __ro__ (all). This just means that if no quantifier is given explicitly, the meaning is the same as if the implicit quantifier had been used.
Not all sumti have __ro__ as the implicit quantifier, however. Consider the quotation in:
**Example 6.34. **
mi | cusku | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say, “You walk on the ice.”  
---  
  

What is the implicit quantifier of the quotation _lu do cadzu le bisli li'u_? Surely not __ro__. If __ro__ were supplied explicitly, thus:
**Example 6.35. **
mi | cusku | ro | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | all-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

the meaning would be something like “I say every occurrence of the sentence 'You walk on the ice'”. Of course I don't say every occurrence of it, only some occurrences. One might suppose that Example 6.34 means that I express exactly one occurrence, but it is more Lojbanic to leave the number unspecified, as with other sumti. We can say definitely, however, that I say it at least once.
The Lojban cmavo meaning “at least” is __su'o__ , and if no ordinary number follows, __su'o__ means “at least once”. (See Example 6.32 for the use of __su'o__ with an ordinary number). Therefore, the explicitly quantified version of Example 6.34 is
**Example 6.36. **
mi | cusku | su'o | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | at-least-one-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
I say one or more instances of “You walk on the ice”.  
---  
I say “You walk on the ice”.  
  

If an explicit ordinary number such as __re__ were to appear, it would have to convey an exact expression, so
**Example 6.37. **
mi | cusku | re | lu | do | cadzu | le | bisli | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | two-of | [quote] | you | walk-on | the | ice | [unquote].  
  

means that I say the sentence exactly twice, neither more nor less.

# Chapter 20. A Catalogue of selma'o
## 20.1. A Catalogue Of selma'o
The following paragraphs list all the selma'o of Lojban, with a brief explanation of what each one is about, and reference to the chapter number where each is explained more fully. As usual, all selma'o names are given in capital letters (with “h” serving as the capital of “'”) and are the names of a representative cmavo, often the most important or the first in alphabetical order. One example is given of each selma'o: for selma'o which have several uses, the most common use is shown.
###  selma'o A (Section 14.6) 
Specifies a logical connection (e.g. “and”, “or”, “if”), usually between sumti.
la djan. | a | la djein. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
John | and/or | Jane | goes-to | the | store  
Also used to create vowel lerfu words when followed with “bu”.
###  selma'o BAI (Section 9.6) 
May be prefixed to a sumti to specify an additional place, not otherwise present in the place structure of the selbri, and derived from a single place of some other selbri.
mi | tavla | bau | la lojban.  
---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | Lojban.  
###  selma'o BAhE (Section 19.11) 
Emphasizes the next single word, or marks it as a nonce word (one invented for the occasion).
la ba'e .djordj. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
_George_ | goes-to | the | store.  
It is George who goes to the store.  
---  
###  selma'o BE (Section 5.7) 
Attaches sumti which fill the place structure of a single unit making up a tanru. Unless otherwise indicated, the sumti fill the x2, x3, and successive places in that order. BE is most useful in descriptions formed with LE. See BEI, BEhO.
mi |  | klama | be | ta |  | troci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-a | (goer | to | that) | type-of | trier.  
I try to go to that place.  
---  
###  selma'o BEI (Section 5.7) 
Separates multiple sumti attached by BE to a tanru unit.
mi |  | klama | be | le | zarci | bei | le | zdani | be'o |  | troci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-a | (goer | to | the | store | from | the | home | ) | type-of | trier.  
I try to go from the home to the market.  
---  
###  selma'o BEhO (Section 5.7) 
Elidable terminator for BE. Terminates sumti that are attached to a tanru unit.
mi |  | klama | be | le | zarci | be'o |  | troci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-a | (goer | to | the | market | ) | type-of | trier.  
I try to go to the market.  
---  
###  selma'o BIhE (Section 18.5) 
Prefixed to a mathematical operator to mark it as higher priority than other mathematical operators, binding its operands more closely.
li | ci | bi'e | pi'i | vo | su'i | mu | du | li | paze  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | 3 | [priority] | times | 4 | plus | 5 | equals | the-number | 17.  
3 × 4 + 5 = 17  
---  
###  selma'o BIhI (Section 14.16) 
Joins sumti or tanru units (as well as some other things) to form intervals. See GAhO.
mi | ca | sanli | la drezdn. | bi'i | la frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [present] | stand-on-surface | Dresden | [interval] | Frankfurt.  
I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt.  
---  
###  selma'o BO (Section 5.3, Section 15.6, Section 18.17) 
Joins tanru units, binding them together closely. Also used to bind logically or non-logically connected phrases, sentences, etc. BO is always high precedence and right-grouping.
ta | cmalu |  | nixli | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-small | type-of | (girl | type-of | school).  
That is a small school for girls.  
---  
###  selma'o BOI (Section 18.6) 
Elidable terminator for PA or BY. Used to terminate a number (string of numeric cmavo) or lerfu string (string of letter words) when another string immediately follows.
li | re | du | li | vu'u | vo boi |  | re  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

## 10.23. Tenses versus modals
Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in Chapter 9. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
**Example 10.171. **
mi | nelci | do | mu'i | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | with-motivation | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you because you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x1 place of the gismu __mukti__ (which underlies the modal __mu'i__), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
**Example 10.172. **
mi | nelci | do | ba | le | nu | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | after | the | event-of | you | like | me.  
I like you after you like me.  
---  
  

places the _le nu_ sumti in the x2 place of the gismu __balvi__ (which underlies the tense __ba__), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172, employing the brivla __mukti__ and __balvi__ explicitly, would be:
**Example 10.173. **
le | nu | do | nelci | mi | cu | mukti | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | you | like | me |  | motivates | the | event-of  
mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---  
I | like | you.  
Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.  
---  
  

and
**Example 10.174. **
le | nu | mi | nelci | do | cu | balvi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | I | like | you |  | is-after | the | event-of  
do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---  
you | like | me.  
My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.  
---  
  

(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; Example 10.173 and Example 10.174 claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of Example 10.171 and Example 10.172 are, respectively:
**Example 10.175. **
mi | nelci | do | .imu'ibo | do | nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | [That-is] Because | you | like | me.  
  

**Example 10.176. **
do | nelci | mi | .ibabo | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | like | me. | Afterward, | I | like | you.  
  

In Example 10.175, the order of the two bridi _mi nelci do_ and _do nelci mi_ is the same as in Example 10.171. In Example 10.176, however, the order is reversed: the origin point _do nelci mi_ physically appears before the future-time event _mi nelci do_. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of __mukti__ or __balvi__.
In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is not found. The forethought equivalents of Example 10.175 and Example 10.176 are
**Example 10.177. **
mu'igi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Because | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

and
**Example 10.178. **
bagi | do | nelci | mi | gi | mi | nelci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
After | you | like | me | , | I | like | you.  
  

respectively.
The following modal sentence schemata (where X and Y represent sentences) all have the same meaning:
X .i BAI bo Y   
---  
BAI gi Y gi X   
X BAI le nu Y   
whereas the following tensed sentence schemata also have the same meaning:
X .i TENSE bo Y   
---  
TENSE gi X gi Y   
Y TENSE le nu X   
neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1 place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple rule exists.

## 13.3. Propositional attitude indicators
As mentioned at the beginning of Section 13.2, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if ...”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with _a_ and those beginning with _e_ ; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the _a_ -series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the _e_ -series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the _a_ -series and the _e_ -series is similar to that between the _u_ -series and the _o_ -series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the _i_ -series as well.
In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes is itself a bit shaky: __u'u__ can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator meaning “I regret that ...”, and __a'e__ (discussed below) can be seen as a pure emotion meaning “I'm awake/aware”. The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with _a_ :
.a'a |  attentive |  inattentive |  avoiding  
---|---|---|---  
.a'e |  alertness |  |  exhaustion  
.ai |  intent |  indecision |  refusal  
.a'i |  effort |  no real effort |  repose  
.a'o |  hope |  |  despair  
.au |  desire |  indifference |  reluctance  
.a'u |  interest |  no interest |  repulsion  
Some examples (of a parental kind):
**Example 13.25. **
.a'a | do | zgana | le | veltivni  
---|---|---|---|---  
[attentive] | you | observe | the | television-receiver.  
I'm noticing that you are watching the TV.  
---  
  

**Example 13.26. **
.a'enai | do | ranji | bacru  
---|---|---|---

(In a real-life situation, Example 13.25 through Example 13.31 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including _.oicai_ , but probably also _.iucai_.)
Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _e_ , which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with _a_ as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with _o_ do to those beginning with _u_ \- they are more complex or difficult:
.e'a |  permission |  |  prohibition  
---|---|---|---  
.e'e |  competence |  |  incompetence  
.ei |  obligation |  |  freedom  
.e'i |  constraint |  independence |  resistance to constraint  
.e'o |  request |  |  negative request  
.e'u |  suggestion |  no suggestion |  warning  
More examples (after a good night's sleep):
**Example 13.32. **
.e'a | do | sazri | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
[permission] | you | drive | the | car.  
Sure, you can drive the car.  
---  
  

**Example 13.33. **
.e'e | mi | lifri | tu'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---  
[competence] | I | experience | something-related-to | you.  
I feel up to dealing with you.  
---  
  

**Example 13.34. **
.ei | mi | tisygau | le | karce | ctilyvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[obligation] | I | fill | the | car-type-of | petroleum-container.  
I should fill the car's gas tank.  
---  
  

**Example 13.35. **
.e'o | ko | ko | kurji  
---|---|---|---  
[request] | you-imperative | of-you-imperative | take-care.  
Please take care of yourself!  
---  
  

**Example 13.36. **
.e'u | do | klama | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[suggestion] | you | go | to-the | park.  
I suggest going to the park.  
---  
  

Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with _i_ , which are the overflow from the other sets:
.ia |  belief |  skepticism |  disbelief  
---|---|---|---  
.i'a |  acceptance |  |  blame  
.ie |  agreement |  |  disagreement  
.i'e |  approval |  non-approval |  disapproval  
Still more examples (much, much later):
**Example 13.37. **
.ianai | do | pu | pensi | le | nu | tcica | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[disbelief] | you | [past] | think | the | event-of | deceiving | me.  
I can't believe you thought you could fool me.  
---  
  

**Example 13.38. **
do | .i'anai | na | xruti | do | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | [blame] | did-not | return | you | to-the | house.  
I blame you for not coming home.  
---  
  

**Example 13.39. **
.ie | mi | na | cusku | lu'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
[agreement] | I | did-not | express | a-symbol-for  
le | tcika | be | le | nu | xruti  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | time-of-day | of | the | event-of | return.  
It's true I didn't tell you when to come back.  
---  
  

**Example 13.40. **
.i'enai | do | .i'e | zukte  
---|---|---|---  
[disapproval] | you | [approval] | act.  
I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.  
---  
  

Example 13.40 illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, __i'e__ , in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to __do__). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of Example 13.32 which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
**Example 13.41. **
do | sazri | le | karce | .i | .e'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | drive | the | car. |  | [Permission].  
You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.  
---

## 9.8. Other modal connections
Like many Lojban grammatical constructions, sentence modal connection has both forethought and afterthought forms. (See Chapter 14 for a more detailed discussion of Lojban connectives.) Section 9.7 exemplifies only afterthought modal connection, illustrated here by:
**Example 9.44. **
mi | jgari | lei | djacu  
---|---|---|---  
I | grasp | the-mass-of | water  
.iri'abo | mi | jgari | le | kabri  
---|---|---|---|---  
with-physical-cause | I | grasp | the | cup.  
Causing the mass of water to be grasped by me, I grasped the cup.  
---  
I grasp the water because I grasp the cup.  
  

An afterthought connection is one that is signaled only by a cmavo (or a compound cmavo, in this case) between the two constructs being connected. Forethought connection uses a signal both before the first construct and between the two: the use of “both” and “and” in the first half of this sentence represents a forethought connection (though not a modal one).
To make forethought modal sentence connections in Lojban, place the modal plus __gi__ before the first bridi, and __gi__ between the two. No __i__ is used within the construct. The forethought equivalent of Example 9.44 is:
**Example 9.45. **
ri'agi | mi | jgari | le | kabri | gi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
With-physical-cause | I | grasp | the | cup | ,  
mi | jgari | lei | djacu  
---|---|---|---  
I | grasp | the-mass-of | water.  
Because I grasp the cup, I grasp the water.  
---  
  

Note that the cause, the x1 of __rinka__ is now placed first. To keep the two bridi in the original order of Example 9.44, we could say:
**Example 9.46. **
seri'agi | mi | jgari | lei | djacu | gi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
With-physical-effect | I | grasp | the-mass-of | water | ,  
mi | jgari | le | kabri  
---|---|---|---  
I | grasp | the | cup.  
  

In English, the sentence “Therefore I grasp the water, I grasp the cup” is ungrammatical, because “therefore” is not grammatically equivalent to “because”. In Lojban, _seri'agi_ can be used just like _ri'agi_.
When the two bridi joined by a modal connection have one or more elements (selbri or sumti or both) in common, there are various condensed forms that can be used in place of full modal sentence connection with both bridi completely stated.
When the bridi are the same except for a single sumti, as in Example 9.44 through Example 9.46, then a sumti modal connection may be employed:
**Example 9.47. **
mi | jgari | ri'agi | le | kabri | gi | lei | djacu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | grasp | because | the | cup | , | the-mass-of | water.  
  

Example 9.47 means exactly the same as Example 9.44 through Example 9.46, but there is no idiomatic English translation that will distinguish it from them.
If the two connected bridi are different in more than one sumti, then a termset may be employed. Termsets are explained more fully in Section 14.11, but are essentially a mechanism for creating connections between multiple sumti simultaneously.
**Example 9.48. **
mi | dunda | le | cukta | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | gave | the | book | to-that-named | John.  
.imu'ibo | la | djan. | dunda | lei | jdini | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Motivated-by | that-named | John | gave | the-mass-of | money | to-me.  
I gave the book to John, because John gave money to me.  
---  
  

means the same as:
**Example 9.49. **
nu'i | mu'igi | la | djan. | lei | jdini | mi | gi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[start] | because | that-named | John, | the-mass-of | money, | me | ;  
mi | le | cukta | la | djan. | nu'u | dunda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I, | the | book, | that-named | John | [end] | gives.  
  

Here there are three sumti in each half of the termset, because the two bridi share only their selbri.
There is no modal connection between selbri as such: bridi which differ only in the selbri can be modally connected using bridi-tail modal connection. The bridi-tail construct is more fully explained in Section 14.9, but essentially it consists of a selbri with optional sumti following it. Example 9.37 is suitable for bridi-tail connection, and could be shortened to:
**Example 9.50. **
mi | mu'igi | viska | le | cukta | gi | lebna | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I, | because | saw | the | book, |  | took | the | book.  
  

Again, no straightforward English translation exists. It is even possible to shorten Example 9.50 further to:
**Example 9.51. **
mi | mu'igi | viska | gi | lebna | vau | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | because | saw, | therefore | took, |  | the | book.  
  

where _le cukta_ is set off by the non-elidable __vau__ and is made to belong to both bridi-tails – see Section 14.9 for more explanations.
Since this is a chapter on rearranging sumti, it is worth pointing out that Example 9.51 can be further rearranged to:
**Example 9.52. **
mi | le | cukta | mu'igi | viska | gi | lebna  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I, | the | book, | because | saw, | therefore | took.  
  

which doesn't require the extra __vau__ ; all sumti before a conjunction of bridi-tails are shared.
Finally, mathematical operands can be modally connected.
**Example 9.53. **
li | ny. | du | li | vo  
---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | n | = | the-number | 4.  
.ini'ibo | li | ny. | du | li | re | su'i | re  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Entailed-by | the-number | n | = | the-number | 2 | + | 2.  
n = 4 because n = 2 + 2.  
---  
  

can be reduced to:
**Example 9.54. **
li | ny. | du | li  
---|---|---|---  
the-number | n | = | the-number  
ni'igi | vei | re | su'i | re | [ve'o] | gi | vo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
because | ( | 2 | + | 2 | ) | therefore | 4.  
n is 2 + 2, and is thus 4.  
---  
  

The cmavo __vei__ and __ve'o__ represent mathematical parentheses, and are required so that _ni'igi_ affects more than just the immediately following operand, namely the first __re__. (The right parenthesis, __ve'o__ , is an elidable terminator.) As usual, no English translation does Example 9.54 justice.
Note: Due to restrictions on the Lojban parsing algorithm, it is not possible to form modal connectives using the _fi'o-_ plus-selbri form of modal. Only the predefined modals of selma'o BAI can be compounded as shown in Section 9.7 and Section 9.8.

## 8.3. Relative phrases
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
pe |  GOI |  restrictive association  
---|---|---  
po |  GOI |  restrictive possession  
po'e |  GOI |  restrictive intrinsic possession  
po'u |  GOI |  restrictive identification  
ne |  GOI |  incidental association  
no'u |  GOI |  incidental identification  
ge'u |  GEhU |  relative phrase terminator  
There are types of relative clauses (those which have a certain selbri) which are frequently wanted in Lojban, and can be expressed using a shortcut called a relative phrase. Relative phrases are introduced by cmavo of selma'o GOI, and consist of a GOI cmavo followed by a single sumti.
Here is an example of __pe__ , plus an equivalent sentence using a relative clause:
**Example 8.18. **
le | stizu | pe | mi | cu | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair | associated-with | me |  | is-blue.  
My chair is blue.  
---  
  

**Example 8.19. **
le | stizu | poi | ke'a | srana | mi | cu | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair | such-that-( | IT | is-associated-with | me | ) | is-blue.  
  

In Example 8.18 and Example 8.19, the link between the chair and the speaker is of the loosest kind.
Here is an example of __po__ :
**Example 8.20. **
le | stizu | po | mi | cu | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair | specific-to | me |  | is-red.  
  

**Example 8.21. **
le | stizu | poi | ke'a | se steci | srana | mi | cu | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair | such-that-( | IT | is-specifically | associated-with | me | ) | is-red.  
  

Example 8.20 and Example 8.21 contrast with Example 8.18 and Example 8.19: the chair is more permanently connected with the speaker. A plausible (though not the only possible) contrast between Example 8.18 and Example 8.20 is that _pe mi_ would be appropriate for a chair the speaker is currently sitting on (whether or not the speaker owned that chair), and _po mi_ for a chair owned by the speaker (whether or not he or she was currently occupying it).
As a result, the relationship expressed between two sumti by __po__ is usually called “possession”, although it does not necessarily imply ownership, legal or otherwise. The central concept is that of specificity (__steci__ in Lojban).
Here is an example of __po'e__ , as well as another example of __po__ :
**Example 8.22. **
le | birka | po'e | mi | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | arm | intrinsically-possessed-by | me |  | is-broken  
  

**Example 8.23. **
le | birka | poi | jinzi | ke | se steci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | arm | which | is-intrinsically | ( | specifically  
srana | mi | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---  
associated-with) | me |  | is-broken.  
  

**Example 8.24. **
le | botpi | po | mi | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | bottle | specific-to | me |  | is-broken  
  

Example 8.22 and Example 8.23 on the one hand, and Example 8.24 on the other, illustrate the contrast between two types of possession called “intrinsic” and “extrinsic”, or sometimes “inalienable” and “alienable”, respectively. Something is intrinsically (or inalienably) possessed by someone if the possession is part of the possessor, and cannot be changed without changing the possessor. In the case of Example 8.22, people are usually taken to intrinsically possess their arms: even if an arm is cut off, it remains the arm of that person. (If the arm is transplanted to another person, however, it becomes intrinsically possessed by the new user, though, so intrinsic possession is a matter of degree.)
By contrast, the bottle of Example 8.24 can be given away, or thrown away, or lost, or stolen, so it is possessed extrinsically (alienably). The exact line between intrinsic and extrinsic possession is culturally dependent. The U.S. Declaration of Independence speaks of the “inalienable rights” of men, but just what those rights are, and even whether the concept makes sense at all, varies from culture to culture.
Note that Example 8.22 can also be expressed without a relative clause:
**Example 8.25. **
le | birka | be | mi | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | arm | of-body | me |  | is-broken  
  

reflecting the fact that the gismu __birka__ has an x2 place representing the body to which the arm belongs. Many, but not all, cases of intrinsic possession can be thus covered without using __po'e__ by placing the possessor into the appropriate place of the description selbri.
Here is an example of __po'u__ :
**Example 8.26. **
le | gerku | po'u | le | mi | pendo | cu | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which-is |  | my | friend |  | kisses | me.  
  

**Example 8.27. **
le | gerku | poi | du | le | mi | pendo | cu | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which | = |  | my | friend |  | kisses | me.  
  

The cmavo __po'u__ does not represent possession at all, but rather identity. (Note that it means _poi du_ and its form was chosen to suggest the relationship.)
In Example 8.26, the use of __po'u__ tells us that _le gerku_ and _le mi pendo_ represent the same thing. Consider the contrast between Example 8.26 and:
**Example 8.28. **
le | mi | pendo | po'u | le | gerku | cu | cinba | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| My | friend | which-is | the | dog |  | kisses | me.  
  

The facts of the case are the same, but the listener's knowledge about the situation may not be. In Example 8.26, the listener is presumed not to understand which dog is meant by _le gerku_ , so the speaker adds a relative phrase clarifying that it is the particular dog which is the speaker's friend.
Example 8.28, however, assumes that the listener does not know which of the speaker's friends is referred to, and specifies that it is the friend that is the dog (which dog is taken to be obvious). Here is another example of the same contrast:
**Example 8.29. **
le | tcadu | po'u | la nu,iork  
---|---|---|---  
The city of New--York [not another city]  
---  
  

**Example 8.30. **
la nu,iork | po'u | le | tcadu  
---|---|---|---  
New--York -- the city (not the state or some other New York)  
---  
  

The principle that the possessor and the possessed may change places applies to all the GOI cmavo, and allows for the possibility of odd effects:
**Example 8.31. **
le | kabri | pe | le | mi | pendo | cu | cmalu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | cup | associated-with |  | my | friend |  | is-small.  
My friend's cup is small  
---  
  

**Example 8.32. **
le | mi | pendo | pe | le | kabri | cu | cmalu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| My | friend | associated-with | the | cup |  | is-small.  
My friend, the one with the cup, is small.  
---  
  

Example 8.31 is useful in a context which is about my friend, and states that his or her cup is small, whereas Example 8.32 is useful in a context that is primarily about a certain cup, and makes a claim about “my friend of the cup”, as opposed to some other friend of mine. Here the cup appears to “possess” the person! English can't even express this relationship with a possessive – “the cup's friend of mine” looks like nonsense – but Lojban has no trouble doing so.
Finally, the cmavo __ne__ and __no'u__ stand to __pe__ and __po'u__ , respectively, as __noi__ does to _poi-_ they provide incidental information:
**Example 8.33. **
le | blabi | gerku | ne | mi | cu | batci | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | white | dog, | incidentally-associated-with | me | , | bites | you.  
The white dog, which is mine, bites you.  
---  
  

In Example 8.33, the white dog is already fully identified (after all, presumably the listener knows which dog bit him or her!). The fact that it is yours is merely incidental to the main bridi claim.
Distinguishing between __po'u__ and __no'u__ can be a little tricky. Consider a room with several men in it, one of whom is named Jim. If you don't know their names, I might say:
**Example 8.34. **
le | nanmu | no'u | la | djim. | cu | terpemci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man, | incidentally-who-is | that-named | Jim | , | is-a-poet.  
The man, Jim, is a poet.  
---  
  

Here I am saying that one of the men is a poet, and incidentally telling you that he is Jim. But if you do know the names, then
**Example 8.35. **
le | nanmu | po'u | la | djim. | cu | terpemci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | who-is | that-named | Jim |  | is-a-poet.  
The man Jim is a poet.  
---  
  

is appropriate. Now I am using the fact that the man I am speaking of is Jim in order to pick out which man I mean.
It is worth mentioning that English sometimes over-specifies possession from the Lojban point of view (and the point of view of many other languages, including ones closely related to English). The idiomatic English sentence
**Example 8.36. **
The man put his hands in his pockets.
  

seems strange to a French- or German-speaking person: whose pockets would he put his hands into? and even odder, whose hands would he put into his pockets? In Lojban, the sentence
**Example 8.37. **
le | nanmu | cu | punji | le | xance |  | le | daski  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man |  | puts | the | hand | at-locus | the | pocket.  
  

is very natural. Of course, if the man is in fact putting his hands into another's pockets, or another's hands into his pockets, the fact can be specified.
Finally, the elidable terminator for GOI cmavo is __ge'u__ of selma'o GEhU; it is almost never required. However, if a logical connective immediately follows a sumti modified by a relative phrase, then an explicit __ge'u__ is needed to allow the connective to affect the relativized sumti rather than the sumti of the relative phrase. (What about the cmavo after which selma'o GOI is named? It is discussed in Section 7.5, as it is not semantically akin to the other kinds of relative phrases, although the syntax is the same.)
