## 7.4. Utterance pro-sumti: the di'u-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
di'u |  KOhA |  di'u-series |  the previous utterance   
---|---|---|---  
de'u |  KOhA |  di'u-series |  an earlier utterance  
da'u |  KOhA |  di'u-series |  a much earlier utterance  
di'e |  KOhA |  di'u-series |  the next utterance  
de'e |  KOhA |  di'u-series |  a later utterance  
da'e |  KOhA |  di'u-series |  a much later utterance  
dei |  KOhA |  di'u-series |  this very utterance  
do'i |  KOhA |  di'u-series |  some utterance  
The cmavo of the di'u-series enable us to talk about things that have been, are being, or will be said. In English, it is normal to use “this” and “that” for this (indeed, the immediately preceding “this” is an example of such a usage):
**Example 7.14. **
You don't like cats.
That is untrue.
  

Here “that” does not refer to something that can be pointed to, but to the preceding sentence “You don't like cats”. In Lojban, therefore, Example 7.14 is rendered:
**Example 7.15. **
do | na | nelci | loi | mlatu  
---|---|---|---|---  
You | (Not!) | like | the-mass-of | cats  
.i | di'u | jitfa | jufra  
---|---|---|---  
. | The-previous-utterance | is-a-false | sentence.  
  

Using __ta__ instead of __di'u__ would cause the listener to look around to see what the speaker of the second sentence was physically pointing to.
As with __ti__ , __ta__ , and __tu__ , the cmavo of the di'u-series come in threes: a close utterance, a medium-distance utterance, and a distant utterance, either in the past or in the future. It turned out to be impossible to use the _i_ / _a_ / _u_ vowel convention of the demonstratives in Section 7.3 without causing collisions with other cmavo, and so the di'u-series has a unique _i_ / _e_ / _a_ convention in the first vowel of the cmavo.
Most references in speech are to the past (what has already been said), so __di'e__ , __de'e__ , and __da'e__ are not very useful when speaking. In writing, they are frequently handy:
**Example 7.16. **
la | saimn. | cusku | di'e  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | Simon | expresses | the-following-utterance.  
Simon says:  
---  
  

Example 7.16 would typically be followed by a quotation. Note that although presumably the quotation is of something Simon has said in the past, the quotation utterance itself would appear after Example 7.16, and so __di'e__ is appropriate.
The remaining two cmavo, __dei__ and __do'i__ , refer respectively to the very utterance that the speaker is uttering, and to some vague or unspecified utterance uttered by someone at some time:
**Example 7.17. **
dei | jetnu | jufra  
---|---|---  
This-utterance | is-a-true | sentence.  
What I am saying (at this moment) is true.  
---  
  

**Example 7.18. **
do'i | jetnu | jufra  
---|---|---  
Some-utterance | is-a-true | sentence.  
That's true (where “that” is not necessarily what was just said).  
---  
  

The cmavo of the di'u-series have a meaning that is relative to the context. The referent of __dei__ in the current utterance is the same as the referent of __di'u__ in the next utterance. The term “utterance” is used rather than “sentence” because the amount of speech or written text referred to by any of these words is vague. Often, a single bridi is intended, but longer utterances may be thus referred to.
Note one very common construction with __di'u__ and the cmavo __la'e__ (of selma'o LAhE; see Section 6.10) which precedes a sumti and means “the thing referred to by (the sumti)”:
**Example 7.19. **
mi | prami | la | djein. | .i | mi | nelci | la'e | di'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | love | that-named | Jane. | And | I | like | the-referent-of | the-last-utterance.  
I love Jane, and I like that.  
---  
  

The effect of _la'e di'u_ in Example 7.19 is that the speaker likes, not the previous sentence, but rather the state of affairs referred to by the previous sentence, namely his loving Jane. This cmavo compound is often written as a single word: __la'edi'u__. It is important not to mix up __di'u__ and __la'edi'u__ , or the wrong meaning will generally result:
**Example 7.20. **
mi | prami | la | djein. | .i | mi | nelci | di'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | love | that-named | Jane. | And | I | like | the-last-utterance.  
  

says that the speaker likes one of his own sentences.
There are no pro-bridi corresponding to the di'u-series.
