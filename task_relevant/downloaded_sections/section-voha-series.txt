## 7.8. Reflexive and reciprocal pro-sumti: the vo'a-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
vo'a |  KOhA |  vo'a-series |  x1 of this bridi   
---|---|---|---  
vo'e |  KOhA |  vo'a-series |  x2 of this bridi  
vo'i |  KOhA |  vo'a-series |  x3 of this bridi  
vo'o |  KOhA |  vo'a-series |  x4 of this bridi  
vo'u |  KOhA |  vo'a-series |  x5 of this bridi  
soi |  SOI |  |  reciprocity  
se'u |  SEhU |  |  soi terminator  
The cmavo of the vo'a-series are pro-sumti anaphora, like those of the ri-series, but have a specific function. These cmavo refer to the other places of the same bridi; the five of them represent up to five places. The same vo'a-series cmavo mean different things in different bridi. Some examples:
**Example 7.57. **
mi lumci vo'a  
---  
I wash myself  
---  
  

**Example 7.58. **
mi klama le zarci vo'e  
---  
I go to the store from itself [by some route unspecified].  
---  
  

To refer to places of neighboring bridi, constructions like _le se go'i ku_ do the job: this refers to the 2nd place of the previous main bridi, as explained in Section 7.6.
The cmavo of the vo'a-series are also used with __soi__ (of selma'o SOI) to precisely express reciprocity, which in English is imprecisely expressed with a discursive phrase like “vice versa”:
**Example 7.59. **
mi | prami | do | soi | vo'a | vo'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | love | you | [reciprocity] | [x1 of this bridi] | [x2 of this bridi].  
I love you and vice versa (swapping “I” and “you”).  
---  
  

The significance of _soi vo'a vo'e_ is that the bridi is still true even if the x1 (specified by __vo'a__) and the x2 (specified by __vo'e__) places are interchanged. If only a single sumti follows __soi__ , then the sumti immediately preceding __soi__ is understood to be one of those involved:
**Example 7.60. **
mi | prami | do | soi | vo'a  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | love | you | [reciprocity] | [x1 of this bridi].  
  

again involves the x1 and x2 places.
Of course, other places can be involved, and other sumti may be used in place of vo'a-series cmavo, provided those other sumti can be reasonably understood as referring to the same things mentioned in the bridi proper. Here are several examples that mean the same thing:
**Example 7.61. **
mi bajykla ti ta soi vo'e -  
---  
mi bajykla ti ta soi vo'e vo'i  
soi vo'e vo'i mi bajykla ti ta  
I runningly-go to this from that and vice versa (to that from this).  
---  
  

The elidable terminator for __soi__ is __se'u__ (selma'o SEhU), which is normally needed only if there is just one sumti after the __soi__ , and the __soi__ construction is not at the end of the bridi. Constructions using __soi__ are free modifiers, and as such can go almost anywhere. Here is an example where __se'u__ is required:
**Example 7.62. **
mi | bajykla | ti | soi | vo'i | se'u |  | ta  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | runningly-go-to | this | [reciprocity] | [x3 of this bridi] |  | from | that  
I runningly-go to this from that and vice versa.  
---
