## 5.4. Complex tanru grouping
If one element of a tanru can be another tanru, why not both elements?
**Example 5.25. **
do | mutce | bo | barda | gerku | bo | kavbu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | are-a-(very | type-of | large) | (dog | type-of | capturer).  
You are a very large dog-catcher.  
---  
  

In Example 5.25, the selbri is a tanru with seltau _mutce bo barda_ and tertau _gerku bo kavbu_. It is worth emphasizing once again that this tanru has the same fundamental ambiguity as all other Lojban tanru: the sense in which the “dog type-of capturer” is said to be “very type-of large” is not precisely specified. Presumably it is his body which is large, but theoretically it could be one of his other properties.
We will now justify the title of this chapter by exploring the ramifications of the phrase “pretty little girls' school”, an expansion of the tanru used in Section 5.3 to four brivla. (Although this example has been used in the Loglan Project almost since the beginning – it first appeared in Quine's book _Word and Object_ (1960) – it is actually a mediocre example because of the ambiguity of English “pretty”; it can mean “beautiful”, the sense intended here, or it can mean “very”. Lojban __melbi__ is not subject to this ambiguity: it means only “beautiful”.)
Here are four ways to group this phrase:
**Example 5.26. **
ta | melbi |  | cmalu |  | nixli |  | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-((pretty | type-of | little) | type-of | girl) | type-of | school.  
That is a school for girls who are beautifully small.  
---  
  

**Example 5.27. **
ta | melbi |  | cmalu | nixli | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-(pretty | type-of | little) | (girl | type-of | school).  
That is a girls' school which is beautifully small.  
---  
  

**Example 5.28. **
ta | melbi |  | cmalu | bo | nixli |  | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-(pretty | type-of | (little | type-of | girl)) | type-of | school.  
That is a school for small girls who are beautiful.  
---  
  

**Example 5.29. **
ta | melbi |  | cmalu | bo | nixli | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-pretty | type-of | (little | type-of | (girl | type-of | school)).  
That is a small school for girls which is beautiful.  
---  
  

Example 5.29 uses a construction which has not been seen before: _cmalu bo nixli bo ckule_ , with two consecutive uses of __bo__ between brivla. The rule for multiple __bo__ constructions is the opposite of the rule when no __bo__ is present at all: the last two are grouped together. Not surprisingly, this is called the “right-grouping rule”, and it is associated with every use of __bo__ in the language. Therefore,
**Example 5.30. **
ta | cmalu | bo | nixli | bo | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-little | type-of | (girl | type-of | school).  
  

means the same as Example 5.19, not Example 5.20. This rule may seem peculiar at first, but one of its consequences is that __bo__ is never necessary between the first two elements of any of the complex tanru presented so far: all of Example 5.26 through Example 5.29 could have __bo__ inserted between __melbi__ and __cmalu__ with no change in meaning.
