## 11.6. Truth-value abstraction: _jei_
The “blueness of the picture” discussed in Section 11.5 refers to the measurable amount of blue pigment (or other source of blueness), not to the degree of truth of the claim that blueness is present. That abstraction is expressed in Lojban using __jei__ , which is closely related semantically to __ni__. In the simplest cases, _le jei_ produces not a number but a truth value:
**Example 11.39. **
le | jei | li | re | su'i | re | du | li | vo | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | truth-value-of | the-number | 2 | + | 2 | = | the-number | 4  
the truth of 2 + 2 being 4  
---  
  

is equivalent to “truth”, and
**Example 11.40. **
le | jei | li | re | su'i | re | du | li | mu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | truth-value-of | the-number | 2 | + | 2 | = | the-number | 5  
the truth of 2 + 2 being 5  
---  
  

is equivalent to “falsehood”.
However, not everything in life (or even in Lojban) is simply true or false. There are shades of gray even in truth value, and __jei__ is Lojban's mechanism for indicating the shade of grey intended:
**Example 11.41. **
mi | ba | jdice | le | jei | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | decide | the | (truth-value of | that-named | George  
cu | zekri | gasnu | [kei]  
---|---|---|---  
| being-a-(crime | doer) | ).  
I will decide whether George is a criminal.  
---  
  

Example 11.41 does not imply that George is, or is not, definitely a criminal. Depending on the legal system I am using, I may make some intermediate decision. As a result, __jei__ requires an x2 place analogous to that of __ni__ :
> _ _jei_ _ x1 is the truth value of (the bridi) under epistemology x2
Abstractions using __jei__ are the mechanism for fuzzy logic in Lojban; the __jei__ abstraction refers to a number between 0 and 1 inclusive (as distinct from __ni__ abstractions, which are often on open-ended scales). The detailed conventions for using __jei__ in fuzzy-logic contexts have not yet been established.
