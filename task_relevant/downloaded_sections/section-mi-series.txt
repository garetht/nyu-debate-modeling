## 7.2. Personal pro-sumti: the mi-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
mi |  KOhA |  mi-series |  I, me   
---|---|---|---  
do |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you  
mi'o |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and I  
mi'a |  KOhA |  mi-series |  I and others, we but not you  
ma'a |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and I and others  
do'o |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you and others  
ko |  KOhA |  mi-series |  you-imperative  
The mi-series of pro-sumti refer to the speaker, the listener, and others in various combinations. __mi__ refers to the speaker and perhaps others for whom the speaker speaks; it may be a Lojbanic mass. __do__ refers to the listener or listeners. Neither __mi__ nor __do__ is specific about the number of persons referred to; for example, the foreman of a jury may refer to the members of the jury as __mi__ , since in speaking officially he represents all of them.
The referents of __mi__ and __do__ are usually obvious from the context, but may be assigned by the vocative words of selma'o COI, explained in Section 13.14. The vocative __mi'e__ assigns __mi__ , whereas all of the other vocatives assign __do__.
**Example 7.5. **
mi'e | .djan. | doi | frank. | mi | cusku | lu | mi | bajra | li'u |  | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I-am | John, | O | Frank, | I | express | [quote] | I | run | [unquote] | to | you  
I am John, Frank; I tell you “I run”.  
---  
  

The cmavo __mi'o__ , __mi'a__ , __ma'a__ , and __do'o__ express various combinations of the speaker and/or the listener and/or other people:
  * __mi'o__ includes only the speaker and the listener but no one else;
  * __mi'a__ includes the speaker and others but excludes the listener;
  * __do'o__ includes the listener and others but excludes the speaker;
  * __ma'a__ includes all three: speaker, listener, others.


All of these pro-sumti represent masses. For example, __mi'o__ is the same as _mi joi do_ , the mass of me and you considered jointly.
In English, “we” can mean __mi__ or __mi'o__ or __mi'a__ or even __ma'a__ , and English-speakers often suffer because they cannot easily distinguish __mi'o__ from __mi'a__ :
**Example 7.6. **
We're going to the store.
  

Does this include the listener or not? There's no way to be sure.
Finally, the cmavo __ko__ is logically equivalent to __do__ ; its referent is the listener. However, its use alters an assertion about the listener into a command to the listener to make the assertion true:
**Example 7.7. **
do | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
You | go-to | the | store.  
  

becomes:
**Example 7.8. **
ko | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
You [imperative] | go-to | the | store.  
Make “you go to the store” true!  
---  
Go to the store!  
  

In English, the subject of a command is omitted, but in Lojban, the word __ko__ must be used. However, __ko__ does not have to appear in the x1 place:
**Example 7.9. **
mi | viska | ko  
---|---|---  
I | see | you-[imperative]  
Make “I see you” true!  
---  
Be seen by me!  
  

In Example 7.9, it is necessary to make the verb passive in English in order to convey the effect of __ko__ in the x2 place. Indeed, __ko__ does not even have to be a sumti of the main bridi:
**Example 7.10. **
mi | viska | le | prenu | poi | prami | ko  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | person | that | loves | you-[imperative]  
Make “I see the person that loves you” true!  
---  
Be such that the person who loves you is seen by me!  
Show me the person who loves you!  
  

As mentioned in Section 7.1, some pro-sumti series have corresponding pro-bridi series. However, there is no equivalent of the mi-series among pro-bridi, since a person isn't a relationship.
