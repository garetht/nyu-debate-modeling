## 9.7. Modal sentence connection: the causals
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ri'a |  BAI |  rinka modal: physical cause  
---|---|---  
ki'u |  BAI |  krinu modal: justification  
mu'i |  BAI |  mukti modal: motivation  
ni'i |  BAI |  nibli modal: logical entailment  
This section has two purposes. On the one hand, it explains the grammatical construct called “modal sentence connection”. On the other, it exemplifies some of the more useful BAI cmavo: the causals. (There are other BAI cmavo which have causal implications: __ja'e__ means “with result”, and so __seja'e__ means “with cause of unspecified nature”; likewise, __gau__ means “with agent” and __tezu'e__ means “with purpose”. These other modal cmavo will not be further discussed here, as my purpose is to explain modal sentence connection rather than Lojbanic views of causation.)
There are four causal gismu in Lojban, distinguishing different versions of the relationships lumped in English as “causal”:
_ _rinka_ _ |  event x1 physically causes event x2  
---|---  
_ _krinu_ _ |  event x1 is the justification for event x2  
_ _mukti_ _ |  event x1 is the (human) motive for event x2  
_ _nibli_ _ |  event x1 logically entails event x2  
Each of these gismu has a related modal: __ri'a__ , __ki'u__ , __mu'i__ , and __ni'i__ respectively. Using these gismu and these modals, we can create various causal sentences with different implications:
**Example 9.35. **
le | spati | cu | banro | ri'a | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | plant |  | grows | with-physical-cause | the | event-of  
do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
you | water | give | to | the | plant.  
The plant grows because you water it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.36. **
la | djan. | cpacu | le | pamoi | se jinga  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John | gets | the | first | prize  
ki'u | le | nu | la | djan. | jinga  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
with-justification | the | event-of | that-named | John | wins.  
John got the first prize because he won.  
---  
  

**Example 9.37. **
mi | lebna | le | cukta | mu'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | took | the | book | with-motivation  
le | nu | mi | viska | le | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | I | saw | the | book.  
I took the book because I saw it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.38. **
la | sokrates. | morsi | binxo | ni'i  
---|---|---|---|---  
| Socrates | dead | became | with-logical-justification  
le | nu | la | sokrates. | remna  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | that-named | Socrates | is-human.  
Socrates died because Socrates is human.  
---  
  

In Example 9.35 through Example 9.38, the same English word “because” is used to translate all four modals, but the types of cause being expressed are quite different. Let us now focus on Example 9.35, and explore some variations on it.
As written, Example 9.35 claims that the plant grows, but only refers to the event of watering it in an abstraction bridi (abstractions are explained in Chapter 11) without actually making a claim. If I express Example 9.35, I have said that the plant in fact grows, but I have not said that you actually water it, merely that there is a causal relationship between watering and growing. This is semantically asymmetrical. Suppose I wanted to claim that the plant was being watered, and only mention its growth as ancillary information? Then we could reverse the main bridi and the abstraction bridi, saying:
**Example 9.39. **
do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | water | give | to | the | plant  
seri'a | le | nu | ri | banro  
---|---|---|---|---  
with-physical-effect | the | event-of | it | grows.  
You water the plant; therefore, it grows.  
---  
  

with the __ri'a__ changed to __seri'a__. In addition, there are also symmetrical forms:
**Example 9.40. **
le | nu | do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati | cu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | event-of | (you | water | give | to | the | plant) |   
rinka | le | nu | le | spati | cu | banro  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
causes | the | event-of | (the | plant |  | grows).  
Your watering the plant causes its growth.  
---  
If you water the plant, then it grows.  
  

does not claim either event, but asserts only the causal relationship between them. So in Example 9.40, I am not saying that the plant grows nor that you have in fact watered it. The second colloquial translation shows a form of “if-then” in English quite distinct from the logical connective “if-then” explained in Chapter 14.
Suppose we wish to claim both events as well as their causal relationship? We can use one of two methods:
**Example 9.41. **
le | spati | cu | banro | .iri'abo | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | plant |  | grows. | Because | you  
djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---  
water | give | to | the | plant.  
The plant grows because you water it.  
---  
  

**Example 9.42. **
do | djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
You | water | give | to | the | plant.  
.iseri'abo | le | spati | cu | banro  
---|---|---|---|---  
Therefore | the | plant |  | grows.  
You water the plant; therefore, it grows.  
---  
  

The compound cmavo _.iri'abo_ and _.iseri'abo_ serve to connect two bridi, as the initial __i__ indicates. The final __bo__ is necessary to prevent the modal from “taking over” the following sumti. If the __bo__ were omitted from Example 9.41 we would have:
**Example 9.43. **
le | spati | cu | banro | .i | ri'a | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | plant |  | grows. |  | Because-of | you,  
| djacu | dunda | fi | le | spati  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[something] | water | gives | to | the | plant.  
The plant grows. Because of you, water is given to the plant.  
---  
  

Because _ri'a do_ is a modal sumti in Example 9.43, there is no longer an explicit sumti in the x1 place of _djacu dunda_ , and the translation must be changed.
The effect of sentences like Example 9.41 and Example 9.42 is that the modal, __ri'a__ in this example, no longer modifies an explicit sumti. Instead, the sumti is implicit, the event given by a full bridi. Furthermore, there is a second implication: that the first bridi fills the x2 place of the gismu __rinka__ ; it specifies an event which is the effect. I am therefore claiming three things: that the plant grows, that you have watered it, and that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the two.
In principle, any modal tag can appear in a sentence connective of the type exemplified by Example 9.41 and Example 9.42. However, it makes little sense to use any modals which do not expect events or other abstractions to fill the places of the corresponding gismu. The sentence connective _.ibaubo_ is perfectly grammatical, but it is hard to imagine any two sentences which could be connected by an “in-language” modal. This is because a sentence describes an event, and an event can be a cause or an effect, but not a language.
