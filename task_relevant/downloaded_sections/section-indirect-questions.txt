## 11.8. Indirect questions
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
kau |  UI |  indirect question marker  
---|---|---  
There is an alternative type of sentence involving __du'u__ and a selbri expressing a propositional attitude. In addition to sentences like
**Example 11.50. **
I know that John went to the store.
  

we can also say things like
**Example 11.51. **
I know who went to the store.
  

This form is called an “indirect question” in English because the embedded English sentence is a question: “Who went to the store?” A person who says Example 11.51 is claiming to know the answer to this question. Indirect questions can occur with many other English verbs as well: I can wonder, or doubt, or see, or hear, as well as know who went to the store.
To express indirect questions in Lojban, we use a _le du'u_ abstraction, but rather than using a question word like “who” (__ma__ in Lojban), we use any word that will fit grammatically and mark it with the suffix particle __kau__. This cmavo belongs to selma'o UI, so grammatically it can appear anywhere. The simplest Lojban translation of Example 11.51 is therefore:
**Example 11.52. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u  
---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of  
ma | kau | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
X | [indirect-question] | [past] | going-to | the | store.  
  

In Example 11.52, we have chosen to use __ma__ as the word marked by __kau__. In fact, any other sumti would have done as well: __zo'e__ or __da__ or even _la djan._. Using _la djan._ would suggest that it was John who I knew had gone to the store, however:
**Example 11.53. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u  
---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of/fact-that  
la | djan. | kau | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | John | [indirect-question] | [past] | going-to | the | store.  
I know who went to the store, namely John.  
---  
I know that it was John who went to the store.  
  

Using one of the indefinite pro-sumti such as __ma__ , __zo'e__ , or __da__ does not suggest any particular value.
Why does Lojban require the __kau__ marker, rather than using __ma__ as English and Chinese and many other languages do? Because __ma__ always signals a direct question, and so
**Example 11.54. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | ma | pu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | the | predication-of | [what sumti?] | [past] | goes-to | the | store  
  

means
**Example 11.55. **
Who is it that I know goes to the store?
  

It is actually not necessary to use _le du'u_ and __kau__ at all if the indirect question involves a sumti; there is generally a paraphrase of the type:
**Example 11.56. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | pu | klama | be | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the | [past] | goer | to | the | store.  
I know something about the one who went to the store (namely, his identity).  
---  
  

because the x3 place of __djuno__ is the subject of knowledge, as opposed to the fact that is known. But when the questioned point is not a sumti, but (say) a logical connection, then there is no good alternative to __kau__ :
**Example 11.57. **
mi | ba | zgana | le | du'u | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | observe | the | predication-of/fact-that | that-named | John  
jikau | la | djordj. | cu | zvati | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[connective-indirect-question] | that-named | George |  | is-at | the | park.  
I will see whether John or George (or both) is at the park.  
---  
  

In addition, Example 11.56 is only a loose paraphrase of Example 11.52, because it is left to the listener's insight to realize that what is known about the goer-to-the-store is his identity rather than some other of his attributes.
