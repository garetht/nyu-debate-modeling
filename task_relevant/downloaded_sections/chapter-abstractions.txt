# Chapter 11. Events, Qualities, Quantities, And Other Vague Words: On Lojban Abstraction
## 11.1. The syntax of abstraction
The purpose of the feature of Lojban known as “abstraction” is to provide a means for taking whole bridi and packaging them up, as it were, into simple selbri. Syntactically, abstractions are very simple and uniform; semantically, they are rich and complex, with few features in common between one variety of abstraction and another. We will begin by discussing syntax without regard to semantics; as a result, the notion of abstraction may seem unmotivated at first. Bear with this difficulty until Section 11.2.
An abstraction selbri is formed by taking a full bridi and preceding it by any cmavo of selma'o NU. There are twelve such cmavo; they are known as “abstractors”. The bridi is closed by the elidable terminator __kei__ , of selma'o KEI. Thus, to change the bridi
**Example 11.1. **
mi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store  
  

into an abstraction using __nu__ , one of the members of selma'o NU, we change it into
**Example 11.2. **
nu | mi | klama | le | zarci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
an-event-of | my | going-to | the | store  
  

The bridi may be a simple selbri, or it may have associated sumti, as here. It is important to beware of eliding __kei__ improperly, as many of the common uses of abstraction selbri involve following them with words that would appear to be part of the abstraction if __kei__ had been elided.
(Technically, __kei__ is never necessary, because the elidable terminator __vau__ that closes every bridi can substitute for it; however, __kei__ is specific to abstractions, and using it is almost always clearer.)
The grammatical uses of an abstraction selbri are exactly the same as those of a simple brivla. In particular, abstraction selbri may be used as observatives, as in Example 11.2, or used in tanru:
**Example 11.3. **
la | djan. |  | cu | nu | sonci | kei |  | djica  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | is-an |  | (event-of | being-a-soldier | ) | type-of | desirer.  
John wants to be a soldier.  
---  
  

Abstraction selbri may also be used in descriptions, preceded by __le__ (or any other member of selma'o LE):
**Example 11.4. **
la | djan. | cu | djica | le | nu | sonci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John |  | desires | the | event-of | being-a-soldier.  
  

We will most often use descriptions containing abstraction either at the end of a bridi, or just before the main selbri with its __cu__ ; in either of these circumstances, __kei__ can normally be elided.
The place structure of an abstraction selbri depends on the particular abstractor, and will be explained individually in the following sections.
Note: In glosses of bridi within abstractions, the grammatical form used in the English changes. Thus, in the gloss of Example 11.2 we see “my going-to the store” rather than “I go-to the store”; likewise, in the glosses of Example 11.3 and Example 11.4 we see “being-a-soldier” rather than “is-a-soldier”. This procedure reflects the desire for more understandable glosses, and does not indicate any change in the Lojban form. A bridi is a bridi, and undergoes no change when it is used as part of an abstraction selbri.
