## 14.22. Rules for making logical and non-logical connectives
The full set of rules for inserting __na__ , __se__ , and __nai__ into any connective is:
Afterthought logical connectives (eks, jeks, giheks, ijeks):
  * Negate first construct: Place __na__ before the connective cmavo (but after the __i__ of an ijek).
  * Negate second construct: Place __nai__ after the connective cmavo.
  * Exchange constructs: Place __se__ before the connective cmavo (after __na__ if any).


Forethought logical connectives (geks, guheks):
  * Negate first construct: Place __nai__ after the connective cmavo.
  * Negate second construct: Place __nai__ after the __gi__.
  * Exchange constructs: Place __se__ before the connective cmavo.


Non-logical connectives (joiks, joigiks):
  * Negate connection: Place __nai__ after the connective cmavo (but before the __gi__ of a joigik).
  * Exchange constructs: Place __se__ before the connective cmavo.
