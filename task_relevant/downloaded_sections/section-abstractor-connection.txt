## 11.12. Abstractor connection
An abstractor may be replaced by two or more abstractors joined by logical or non-logical connectives. Connectives are explained in detail in Chapter 14. The connection can be expanded to one between two bridi which differ only in abstraction marker. Example 11.74 and Example 11.75 are equivalent in meaning:
**Example 11.74. **
le | ka | la | frank. | ciska | cu | xlali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | quality-of | that-named | Frank | writing |  | is-bad,  
.ije | le | ni | la | frank. | ciska | cu | xlali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
and | the | quantity-of | that-named | Frank | writing |  | is-bad.  
  

**Example 11.75. **
le | ka | je | ni | la | frank. | ciska | cu | xlali  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The quality and quantity of Frank's writing is bad.  
---  
  

This feature of Lojban has hardly ever been used, and nobody knows what uses it may eventually have.
