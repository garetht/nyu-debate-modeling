## 17.11. Mathematical uses of lerfu strings
This chapter is not about Lojban mathematics, which is explained in Chapter 18, so the mathematical uses of lerfu strings will be listed and exemplified but not explained.
  * A lerfu string as mathematical variable:


**Example 17.34. **
li | .abu | du | li | by. | su'i | cy.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | a | equals | the-number | b | plus | c  
a = b + c  
---  
  

  * A lerfu string as function name (preceded by __ma'o__ of selma'o MAhO):


**Example 17.35. **
li | .y.bu | du | li | ma'o | fy. | boi | xy.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | y | equals | the-number | the-function | f | of | x  
y = f(x)  
  

Note the __boi__ here to separate the lerfu strings __fy__ and __xy__.
  * A lerfu string as selbri (followed by a cmavo of selma'o MOI):


**Example 17.36. **
le | vi | ratcu | ny.moi | le'i | mi | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | here | rat | is-nth-of | the-set-of | my | rats  
This rat is my Nth rat.  
---  
  

  * A lerfu string as utterance ordinal (followed by a cmavo of selma'o MAI):


**Example 17.37. **
ny.mai  
---  
Nthly  
---  
  

  * A lerfu string as subscript (preceded by __xi__ of selma'o XI):


**Example 17.38. **
xy. | xi | ky.  
---|---|---  
x | sub | k  
  

  * A lerfu string as quantifier (enclosed in __vei__ … __ve'o__ parentheses):


**Example 17.39. **
vei | ny. | [ve'o] | lo prenu  
---|---|---|---  
( |  “n” | ) | persons  
  

The parentheses are required because _ny. lo prenu_ would be two separate sumti, __ny.__ and _lo prenu_. In general, any mathematical expression other than a simple number must be in parentheses when used as a quantifier; the right parenthesis mark, the cmavo __ve'o__ , can usually be elided.
All the examples above have exhibited single lerfu words rather than lerfu strings, in accordance with the conventions of ordinary mathematics. A longer lerfu string would still be treated as a single variable or function name: in Lojban, _.abu by. cy._ is not the multiplication “a × b × c” but is the variable `abc`. (Of course, a local convention could be employed that made the value of a variable like `abc`, with a multi-lerfu-word name, equal to the values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` multiplied together.)
There is a special rule about shift words in mathematical text: shifts within mathematical expressions do not affect lerfu words appearing outside mathematical expressions, and vice versa.
