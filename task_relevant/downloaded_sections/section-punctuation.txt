## 17.7. Punctuation marks
Lojban does not have punctuation marks as such: the denpa bu and the slaka bu are really a part of the alphabet. Other languages, however, use punctuation marks extensively. As yet, Lojban does not have any words for these punctuation marks, but a mechanism exists for devising them: the cmavo __lau__ of selma'o LAU. __lau__ must always be followed by a BY word; the interpretation of the BY word is changed from a lerfu to a punctuation mark. Typically, this BY word would be a name or brivla with a __bu__ suffix.
Why is __lau__ necessary at all? Why not just use a __bu__ -marked word and announce that it is always to be interpreted as a punctuation mark? Primarily to avoid ambiguity. The __bu__ mechanism is extremely open-ended, and it is easy for Lojban users to make up __bu__ words without bothering to explain what they mean. Using the __lau__ cmavo flags at least the most important of such nonce lerfu words as having a special function: punctuation. (Exactly the same argument applies to the use of __zai__ to signal an alphabet shift or __ce'a__ to signal a font shift.)
Since different alphabets require different punctuation marks, the interpretation of a __lau__ -marked lerfu word is affected by the current alphabet shift and the current font shift.
