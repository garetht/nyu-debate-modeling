## 2.17. Tenses
In English, every verb is tagged for the grammatical category called tense: past, present, or future. The sentence
**Example 2.87. **
John went to the store
  

necessarily happens at some time in the past, whereas
**Example 2.88. **
John is going to the store
  

is necessarily happening right now.
The Lojban sentence
**Example 2.89. **
la djan. |  [cu] |  klama |  le zarci  
---|---|---|---  
John |  - |  goes/went/will-go |  to-the store  
  

serves as a translation of either Example 2.87 or Example 2.88, and of many other possible English sentences as well. It is not marked for tense, and can refer to an event in the past, the present or the future. This rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of representing the time of an event. A close translation of Example 2.87 would be:
**Example 2.90. **
la djan. |  pu |  klama |  le zarci  
---|---|---|---  
John |  [past] |  goes |  to-the store  
  

where the tag __pu__ forces the sentence to refer to a time in the past. Similarly,
**Example 2.91. **
la djan. |  ca |  klama |  le zarci  
---|---|---|---  
John |  [present] |  goes |  to-the store  
  

necessarily refers to the present, because of the tag __ca__. Tags used in this way always appear at the very beginning of the selbri, just after the __cu__ , and they may make a __cu__ unnecessary, since tags cannot be absorbed into tanru. Such tags serve as an equivalent to English tenses and adverbs. In Lojban, tense information is completely optional. If unspecified, the appropriate tense is picked up from context.
Lojban also extends the notion of “tense” to refer not only to time but to space. The following example uses the tag __vu__ to specify that the event it describes happens far away from the speaker:
**Example 2.92. **
do |  vu vecnu |  zo'e  
---|---|---  
You |  yonder sell |  something-unspecified.  
  

In addition, tense tags (either for time or space) can be prefixed to the selbri of a description, producing a tensed sumti:
**Example 2.93. **
le pu bajra |  [ku] |  cu |  tavla  
---|---|---|---  
The earlier/former/past runner |  - |  - |  talked/talks.  
  

(Since Lojban tense is optional, we don't know when he or she talks.)
Tensed sumti with space tags correspond roughly to the English use of “this” or “that” as adjectives, as in the following example, which uses the tag __vi__ meaning “nearby”:
**Example 2.94. **
le vi bajra  |  [ku] |  cu |  tavla  
---|---|---|---  
The nearby runner |  - |  - |  talks.  
This runner talks.  
---  
  

Do not confuse the use of __vi__ in Example 2.94 with the cmavo __ti__ , which also means “this”, but in the sense of “this thing”.
Furthermore, a tense tag can appear both on the selbri and within a description, as in the following example (where __ba__ is the tag for future time):
**Example 2.95. **
le vi tavla  |  [ku] |  cu |  ba klama  
---|---|---|---  
The here talker |  - |  - |  [future] goes.  
The talker who is here will go.  
---  
This talker will go.
