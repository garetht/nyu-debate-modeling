## 9.11. Mixed modal connection
It is possible to mix logical connection (explained in Chapter 14) with modal connection, in a way that simultaneously asserts the logical connection and the modal relationship. Consider the sentences:
**Example 9.74. **
mi | nelci | do | .ije | mi | nelci | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | And | I | like | that-named | Jane.  
  

which is a logical connection, and
**Example 9.75. **
mi | nelci | do | .iki'ubo | mi | nelci | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | Justified-by | I | like | that-named | Jane.  
  

The meanings of Example 9.74 and Example 9.75 can be simultaneously expressed by combining the two compound cmavo, thus:
**Example 9.76. **
mi | nelci | do | .ijeki'ubo | mi | nelci | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you. | And-justified-by | I | like | that-named | Jane.  
  

Here the two sentences _mi nelci do_ and _mi nelci la djein._ are simultaneously asserted, their logical connection is asserted, and their causal relationship is asserted. The logical connective __je__ comes before the modal __ki'u__ in all such mixed connections.
Since _mi nelci do_ and _mi nelci la djein._ differ only in the final sumti, we can transform Example 9.76 into a mixed sumti connection:
**Example 9.77. **
mi | nelci | do | .eki'ubo | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | and/because | that-named | Jane.  
  

Note that this connection is an afterthought one. Mixed connectives are always afterthought; forethought connectives must be either logical or modal.
There are numerous other afterthought logical and non-logical connectives that can have modal information planted within them. For example, a bridi-tail connected version of Example 9.77 would be:
**Example 9.78. **
mi | nelci | do | gi'eki'ubo | nelci | la | djein.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | like | you | and/because | like | that-named | Jane.  
  

The following three complex examples all mean the same thing.
**Example 9.79. **
mi | bevri | le | dakli  
---|---|---|---  
I | carry | the | sack.  
.ijeseri'abo | tu'e | mi | bevri | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
And-[effect] | ( | I | carry | the | dog.  
.ijadu'ibo | mi | bevri | le | mlatu | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
And/or-[equal] | I | carry | the | cat. | )  
I carry the sack. As a result I carry the dog or I carry the cat, equally.  
---  
  

**Example 9.80. **
mi | bevri | le | dakli  
---|---|---|---  
I | carry | the | sack  
gi'eseri'ake | bevri | le | gerku  
---|---|---|---  
and-[effect] | (carry | the | dog  
gi'adu'ibo | bevri | le | mlatu | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and/or-[equal] | carry | the | cat) |   
I carry the sack and as a result carry the dog or carry the cat equally.  
---  
  

**Example 9.81. **
mi | bevri | le | dakli  
---|---|---|---  
I | carry | the | sack  
.eseri'ake | le | gerku  
---|---|---  
and-[effect] | (the | dog  
.adu'ibo | le | mlatu | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---  
and/or-[equal] | the | cat) |   
I carry the sack, and as a result the cat or the dog equally.  
---  
  

In Example 9.79, the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ brackets are the equivalent of the __ke__ … __ke'e__ brackets in Example 9.80 and Example 9.81, because __ke__ … __ke'e__ cannot extend across more than one sentence. It would also be possible to change the _.ijeseri'abo_ to _.ije seri'a_ , which would show that the __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ portion was an effect, but would not pin down the _mi bevri le dakli_ portion as the cause. It is legal for a modal (or a tense; see Chapter 10) to modify the whole of a __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ construct.
Note: The uses of modals discussed in this section are applicable both to BAI modals and to _fi'o-_ plus-selbri modals.
