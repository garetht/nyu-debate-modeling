## 12.10. Eliding SE rafsi from tertau
Eliding SE rafsi from tertau gets us into much more trouble. To understand why, recall that lujvo, following their veljvo, describe some type of whatever their tertau describe. Thus, _posydji_ describes a type of __djica__ , __gerzda__ describes a type of __zdani__ , and so on. What is certain is that __gerzda__ does not describe a _se zdani_ \- it is not a word that could be used to describe an inhabitant such as a dog.
Now consider how we would translate the word “blue-eyed”. Let's tentatively translate this word as __blakanla__ (from _blanu kanla_ , meaning “blue eye”). But immediately we are in trouble: we cannot say
**Example 12.46. **
la | djak. | cu blakanla  
---|---|---  
That-named | Jack | is-a-blue-eye  
  

because Jack is not an eye, __kanla__ , but someone with an eye, _se kanla_. At best we can say
**Example 12.47. **
la | djak. | cu | se blakanla  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | Jack |  | is-the-bearer-of-blue-eyes  
  

But look now at the place structure of __blakanla__ : it is a symmetrical lujvo, so the place structure is:
**Example 12.48. **
> bl1=k1 is a blue eye of bl2=k2
  

We end up being most interested in talking about the second place, not the first (we talk much more of people than of their eyes), so __se__ would almost always be required.
What is happening here is that we are translating the tertau wrongly, under the influence of English. The English suffix “-eyed” does not mean “eye”, but someone with an eye, which is _selkanla_.
Because we've got the wrong tertau (eliding a __se__ that really should be there), any attempt to accommodate the resulting lujvo into our guidelines for place structure is fitting a square peg in a round hole. Since they can be so misleading, lujvo with SE rafsi elided from the tertau should be avoided in favor of their more explicit counterparts: in this case, __blaselkanla__.
