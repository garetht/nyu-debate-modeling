## 3.7. Initial Consonant Pairs
The set of consonant pairs that may appear at the beginning of a word (excluding Lojbanized names) is far more restricted than the fairly large group of permissible consonant pairs described in Section 3.6. Even so, it is more than English allows, although hopefully not more than English-speakers (and others) can learn to pronounce.
There are just 48 such permissible initial consonant pairs, as follows:
_bl_ |  _br_ |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
_cf_ |  _ck_ |  _cl_ |  _cm_ |  _cn_ |  _cp_ |  _cr_ |  _ct_  
_dj_ |  _dr_ |  _dz_  
_fl_ |  _fr_  
_gl_ |  _gr_  
_jb_ |  _jd_ |  _jg_ |  _jm_ |  _jv_  
_kl_ |  _kr_  
_ml_ |  _mr_  
_pl_ |  _pr_  
_sf_ |  _sk_ |  _sl_ |  _sm_ |  _sn_ |  _sp_ |  _sr_ |  _st_  
_tc_ |  _tr_ |  _ts_  
_vl_ |  _vr_  
_xl_ |  _xr_  
_zb_ |  _zd_ |  _zg_ |  _zm_ |  _zv_  
Lest this list seem almost random, a pairing of voiced and unvoiced equivalent vowels will show significant patterns which may help in learning:
_pl_ |  _pr_ |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  _fl_ |  _fr_  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
_bl_ |  _br_ |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  _vl_ |  _vr_  
_cp_ |  _cf_ |  |  |  _ct_ |  _ck_ |  _cm_ |  _cn_ |  |  |  _cl_ |  _cr_  
_jb_ |  _jv_ |  |  |  _jd_ |  _jg_ |  _jm_  
_sp_ |  _sf_ |  |  |  _st_ |  _sk_ |  _sm_ |  _sn_ |  |  |  _sl_ |  _sr_  
_zb_ |  _zv_ |  |  |  _zd_ |  _zg_ |  _zm_  
_tc_ |  _tr_ |  |  |  _ts_ |  |  |  |  |  |  _kl_ |  _kr_  
_dj_ |  _dr_ |  |  |  _dz_ |  |  |  |  |  |  _gl_ |  _gr_  
_ml_ |  _mr_ |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  _xl_ |  _xr_  
Note that if both consonants of an initial pair are voiced, the unvoiced equivalent is also permissible, and the voiced pair can be pronounced simply by voicing the unvoiced pair. (The converse is not true: _cn_ is a permissible initial pair, but _jn_ is not.)
Consonant triples can occur medially in Lojban words. They are subject to the following rules:
  1. The first two consonants must constitute a permissible consonant pair;
  2. The last two consonants must constitute a permissible initial consonant pair;
  3. The triples _ndj_ , _ndz_ , _ntc_ , and _nts_ are forbidden.


Lojbanized names can begin or end with any permissible consonant pair, not just the 48 initial consonant pairs listed above, and can have consonant triples in any location, as long as the pairs making up those triples are permissible. In addition, names can contain consonant clusters with more than three consonants, again requiring that each pair within the cluster is valid.
