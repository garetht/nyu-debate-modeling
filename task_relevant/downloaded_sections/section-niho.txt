## 19.3. Paragraphs: NIhO
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ni'o |  NIhO |  new topic  
---|---|---  
no'i |  NIhO |  old topic  
da'o |  DAhO |  cancel cmavo assignments  
The paragraph is a concept used in writing systems for two purposes: to indicate changes of topic, and to break up the hard-to-read appearance of large blocks of text on the page. The former function is represented in both spoken and written Lojban by the cmavo __ni'o__ and __no'i__ , both of selma'o NIhO. Of these two, __ni'o__ is the more common. By convention, written Lojban is broken into paragraphs just before any __ni'o__ or __no'i__ , but a very long passage on a single topic might be paragraphed before an __i__. On the other hand, it is conventional in English to start a new paragraph in dialogue when a new speaker starts, but this convention is not commonly observed in Lojban dialogues. Of course, none of these conventions affect meaning in any way.
A __ni'o__ can take the place of an __i__ as a sentence separator, and in addition signals a new topic or paragraph. Grammatically, any number of __ni'o__ cmavo can appear consecutively and are equivalent to a single one; semantically, a greater number of __ni'o__ cmavo indicates a larger-scale change of topic. This feature allows complexly structured text, with topics, subtopics, and sub-subtopics, to be represented clearly and unambiguously in both spoken and written Lojban. However, some conventional differences do exist between __ni'o__ in writing and in conversation.
In written text, a single __ni'o__ is a mere discursive indicator of a new subject, whereas _ni'oni'o_ marks a change in the context. In this situation, _ni'oni'o_ implicitly cancels the definitions of all pro-sumti of selma'o KOhA as well as pro-bridi of selma'o GOhA. (Explicit cancelling is expressed by the cmavo __da'o__ of selma'o DAhO, which has the free grammar of an indicator – it can appear almost anywhere.) The use of _ni'oni'o_ does not affect indicators (of selma'o UI) or tense references, but _ni'oni'oni'o_ , indicating a drastic change of topic, would serve to reset both indicators and tenses. (See Section 19.8 for a discussion of indicator scope.)
In spoken text, which is inherently less structured, these levels are reduced by one, with __ni'o__ indicating a change in context sufficient to cancel pro-sumti and pro-bridi assignment. On the other hand, in a book, or in stories within stories such as “The Arabian Nights”, further levels may be expressed by extending the __ni'o__ string as needed. Normally, a written text will begin with the number of __ni'o__ cmavo needed to signal the largest scale division which the text contains. __ni'o__ strings may be subscripted to label each context of discourse: see Section 19.6.
__no'i__ is similar in effect to __ni'o__ , but indicates the resumption of a previous topic. In speech, it is analogous to (but much shorter than) such English discursive phrases as “But getting back to the point ...”. By default, the topic resumed is that in effect before the last __ni'o__. When subtopics are nested within topics, then __no'i__ would resume the previous subtopic and _no'ino'i_ the previous topic. Note that __no'i__ also resumes tense and pro-sumti assignments dropped at the previous __ni'o__.
If a __ni'o__ is subscripted, then a __no'i__ with the same subscript is assumed to be a continuation of it. A __no'i__ may also have a negative subscript, which would specify counting backwards a number of paragraphs and resuming the topic found thereby.
