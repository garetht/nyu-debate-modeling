## 2.14. Vocatives and commands
You may call someone's attention to the fact that you are addressing them by using __doi__ followed by their name. The sentence
**Example 2.55. **
doi djan.
  

means “Oh, John, I'm talking to you”. It also has the effect of setting the value of __do__ ; __do__ now refers to “John” until it is changed in some way in the conversation. Note that Example 2.55 is not a bridi, but it is a legitimate Lojban sentence nevertheless; it is known as a “vocative phrase”.
Other cmavo can be used instead of __doi__ in a vocative phrase, with a different significance. For example, the cmavo __coi__ means “hello” and __co'o__ means “good-bye”. Either word may stand alone, they may follow one another, or either may be followed by a pause and a name. (Vocative phrases with __doi__ do not need a pause before the name.)
**Example 2.56. **
coi. | djan.  
---|---  
Hello, | John.  
  

**Example 2.57. **
co'o. | djan.  
---|---  
Good-bye, | John.  
  

Commands are expressed in Lojban by a simple variation of the main bridi structure. If you say
**Example 2.58. **
do |  tavla  
---|---  
You |  are-talking.  
  

you are simply making a statement of fact. In order to issue a command in Lojban, substitute the word __ko__ for __do__. The bridi
**Example 2.59. **
ko |  tavla  
---|---  
  

instructs the listener to do whatever is necessary to make Example 2.58 true; it means “Talk!” Other examples:
**Example 2.60. **
ko |  sutra  
---|---  
Be fast!  
---  
  

The __ko__ need not be in the x1 place, but rather can occur anywhere a sumti is allowed, leading to possible Lojban commands that are very unlike English commands:
**Example 2.61. **
mi |  tavla |  ko  
---|---|---  
Be talked to by me.  
---  
Let me talk to you.  
  

The cmavo __ko__ can fill any appropriate sumti place, and can be used as often as is appropriate for the selbri:
**Example 2.62. **
ko |  kurji |  ko  
---|---|---  
  

and
**Example 2.63. **
ko |  ko |  kurji  
---|---|---  
  

both mean “You take care of you” and “Be taken care of by you”, or to put it colloquially, “Take care of yourself”.
