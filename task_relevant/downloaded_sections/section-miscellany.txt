## 18.21. Miscellany
A few other points:
__se__ can be used to convert an operator as if it were a selbri, so that its arguments are exchanged. For example:
**Example 18.139. **
li | ci | se | vu'u | vo | du | li | pa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | three | (inverse) | minus | four | equals | the-number | one.  
3 subtracted from 4 equals 1.  
---  
  

The other converters of selma'o SE can also be used on operators with more than two operands, and they can be compounded to create (probably unintelligible) operators as needed.
Members of selma'o NAhE are also legal on an operator to produce a scalar negation of it. The implication is that some other operator would apply to make the bridi true:
**Example 18.140. **
li | ci | na'e | su'i | vo | du | li | pare  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | 3 | non- | plus | 4 | equals | the-number | 12.  
  

**Example 18.141. **
li | ci | to'e | vu'u | re | du | li | mu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | 3 | opposite-of- | minus | 2 | equals | the-number | 5.  
  

The sense in which “plus” is the opposite of “minus” is not a mathematical but rather a linguistic one; negated operators are defined only loosely.
__la'e__ and __lu'e__ can be used on operands with the usual semantics to get the referent of or a symbol for an operand. Likewise, a member of selma'o NAhE followed by __bo__ serves to scalar-negate an operand, implying that some other operand would make the bridi true:
**Example 18.142. **
li | re | su'i | re | du | li | na'ebo | mu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | 2 | plus | 2 | equals | the-number | non- | 5.  
2 + 2 = something other than 5.  
---  
  

The digits 0-9 have rafsi, and therefore can be used in making lujvo. Additionally, all the rafsi have CVC form and can stand alone or together as names:
**Example 18.143. **
la | zel. | poi | gunta | la | tebes. | pu | nanmu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Those-named |  “Seven” | who | attack | that-named |  “Thebes” | [past] | are-men.  
The Seven Against Thebes were men.  
---  
  

Of course, there is no guarantee that the name _zel._ is connected with the number rafsi: an alternative which cannot be misconstrued is:
**Example 18.144. **
la | zemei | poi | gunta  
---|---|---|---  
Those-named-the | Sevensome | who | attack  
la | tebes. | pu | nanmu  
---|---|---|---  
that-named | Thebes | [past] | are-men.  
  

Certain other members of PA also have assigned rafsi: __so'a__ , __so'e__ , __so'i__ , __so'o__ , __so'u__ , __da'a__ , __ro__ , __su'e__ , __su'o__ , __pi__ , and __ce'i__. Furthermore, although the cmavo __fi'u__ does not have a rafsi as such, it is closely related to the gismu __frinu__ , meaning “fraction”; therefore, in a context of numeric rafsi, you can use any of the rafsi for __frinu__ to indicate a fraction slash.
A similar convention is used for the cmavo __cu'o__ of selma'o MOI, which is closely related to __cunso__ (probability); use a rafsi for __cunso__ in order to create lujvo based on __cu'o__. The cmavo __mei__ and __moi__ of MOI have their own rafsi, two each in fact: _mem_ / _mei_ and _mom_ / _moi_ respectively.
The grammar of mekso as described so far imposes a rigid distinction between operators and operands. Some flavors of mathematics (lambda calculus, algebra of functions) blur this distinction, and Lojban must have a method of doing the same. An operator can be changed into an operand with _ni'enu'a_ , which transforms the operator into a matching selbri and then the selbri into an operand.
To change an operand into an operator, we use the cmavo __ma'o__ , already introduced as a means of changing a lerfu string such as __fy.__ into an operator. In fact, __ma'o__ can be followed by any mekso operand, using the elidable terminator __te'u__ if necessary.
There is a potential semantic ambiguity in _ma'o fy. [te'u]_ if __fy.__ is already in use as a variable: it comes to mean “the function whose value is always `f`”. However, mathematicians do not normally use the same lerfu words or strings as both functions and variables, so this case should not arise in practice.
