## 7.6. Anaphoric pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the ri-series and the go'i-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ri |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats last sumti)   
---|---|---|---  
ra |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats previous sumti)  
ru |  KOhA |  ri-series |  (repeats long-ago sumti)  
go'i |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last bridi)  
go'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats previous bridi)  
go'u |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats long-ago bridi)  
go'e |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats last-but-one bridi)  
go'o |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats future bridi)  
nei |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats current bridi)  
no'a |  GOhA |  go'i-series |  (repeats outer bridi)  
ra'o |  RAhO |  |  pro-cmavo update  
The term “anaphora” literally means “repetition”, but is used in linguistics to refer to pronouns whose significance is the repetition of earlier words, namely their antecedents. Lojban provides three pro-sumti anaphora, __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ ; and three corresponding pro-bridi anaphora, __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__. These cmavo reveal the same vowel pattern as the ti-series, but the “distances” referred to are not physical distances, but distances from the anaphoric cmavo to its antecedent.
The cmavo __ri__ is the simplest of these; it has the same referent as the last complete sumti appearing before the __ri__ :
**Example 7.30. **
la | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | ri | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | [repeat-last-sumti] | room.  
Alice sleeps in her room.  
---  
  

The __ri__ in Example 7.30 is equivalent to repeating the last sumti, which is _la .alis._ , so Example 7.30 is equivalent to:
**Example 7.31. **
la | .alis. | sipna | ne'i | le |  | la | .alis. | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | sleeps | in | the | of- | that-named | Alice | room.  
Alice sleeps in Alice's room.  
---  
  

Note that __ri__ does not repeat _le ri kumfa_ , because that sumti is not yet complete when __ri__ appears. This prevents __ri__ from getting entangled in paradoxes of self-reference. (There are plenty of other ways to do that!) Note also that sumti within other sumti, as in quotations, abstractions, and the like, are counted in the order of their beginnings; thus a lower level sumti like _la alis._ in Example 7.31 is considered to be more recent than a higher level sumti that contains it.
Certain sumti are ignored by __ri__ ; specifically, most of the other cmavo of KOhA, and the almost-grammatically-equivalent lerfu words of selma'o BY. It is simpler just to repeat these directly:
**Example 7.32. **
mi | prami | mi  
---|---|---  
I | love | me.  
I love myself.  
---  
  

However, the cmavo of the ti-series can be picked up by __ri__ , because you might have changed what you are pointing at, so repeating __ti__ may not be effective. Likewise, __ri__ itself (or rather its antecedent) can be repeated by a later __ri__ ; in fact, a string of __ri__ cmavo with no other intervening sumti always all repeat the same sumti:
**Example 7.33. **
la | djan. | viska | le | tricu | .i  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | sees | the | tree. |   
ri | se jadni | le |  | ri | jimca  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[repeat-last] | is-adorned-by | the | of- | [repeat-last] | branch.  
John sees the tree. It is adorned by its branches.  
---  
  

Here the second __ri__ has as antecedent the first __ri__ , which has as antecedent _le tricu_. All three refer to the same thing: a tree.
To refer to the next-to-last sumti, the third-from-last sumti, and so on, __ri__ may be subscripted (subscripts are explained in Section 19.6):
**Example 7.34. **
lo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | rixire  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [repeat-next-to-last].  
.i | la | .alis. | pilno | riximu  
---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | uses | [repeat-fifth-from-last].  
  

Here _rixire_ , or “ri-sub-2”, skips _la rik._ to reach _lo forca_. In the same way, _riximu_ , or “ri-sub-5”, skips _la .alis._ , _rixire_ , _la rik._ , and _lo forca_ to reach _lo smuci_. As can clearly be seen, this procedure is barely practicable in writing, and would break down totally in speech.
Therefore, the vaguer __ra__ and __ru__ are also provided. The cmavo __ra__ repeats a recently used sumti, and __ru__ one that was further back in the speech or text. The use of __ra__ and __ru__ forces the listener to guess at the referent, but makes life easier for the speaker. Can __ra__ refer to the last sumti, like __ri__? The answer is no if __ri__ has also been used. If __ri__ has not been used, then __ra__ might be the last sumti. Likewise, if __ra__ has been used, then any use of __ru__ would repeat a sumti earlier than the one __ra__ is repeating. A more reasonable version of Example 7.34, but one that depends more on context, is:
**Example 7.35. **
lo | smuci | .i | lo | forca | .i | la | rik. | pilno | ra  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | spoon. |  | A | fork. |  | That-named | Rick | uses | [some-previous-thing].  
.i | la | .alis. | pilno | ru  
---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | uses | [some-more-remote-thing].  
  

In Example 7.35, the use of __ra__ tells us that something other than _la rik._ is the antecedent; _lo forca_ is the nearest sumti, so it is probably the antecedent. Similarly, the antecedent of __ru__ must be something even further back in the utterance than _lo forca_ , and _lo smuci_ is the obvious candidate.
The meaning of __ri__ must be determined every time it is used. Since __ra__ and __ru__ are more vaguely defined, they may well retain the same meaning for a while, but the listener cannot count on this behavior. To make a permanent reference to something repeated by __ri__ , __ra__ , or __ru__ , use __goi__ and a ko'a-series cmavo:
**Example 7.36. **
la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | goes-to | the | store  
.i | ri | goi | ko'a | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---  
. | It-last-mentioned | also-known-as | it-1 | is-blue.  
  

allows the store to be referred to henceforth as __ko'a__ without ambiguity. Example 7.36 is equivalent to Example 7.21 and eliminates any possibility of __ko'a__ being interpreted by the listener as referring to Alice.
The cmavo __go'i__ , __go'a__ , and __go'u__ follow exactly the same rules as __ri__ , __ra__ , and __ru__ , except that they are pro-bridi, and therefore repeat bridi, not sumti – specifically, main sentence bridi. Any bridi that are embedded within other bridi, such as relative clauses or abstractions, are not counted. Like the cmavo of the broda-series, the cmavo of the go'i-series copy all sumti with them. This makes __go'i__ by itself convenient for answering a question affirmatively, or for repeating the last bridi, possibly with new sumti:
**Example 7.37. **
xu | zo | .djan. | cmene | do | .i | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[True-false?] | The-word |  “John” | is-the-name-of | you? |  | [repeat last bridi].  
Is John your name? Yes.  
---  
  

**Example 7.38. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | .i | do | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store | . | You | [repeat last bridi].  
I go to the store . You, too.  
---  
  

Note that Example 7.38 means the same as Example 7.26, but without the bother of assigning an actual broda-series word to the first bridi. For long-term reference, use _go'i cei broda_ or the like, analogously to _ri goi ko'a_ in Example 7.36.
The remaining four cmavo of the go'i-series are provided for convenience or for achieving special effects. The cmavo __go'e__ means the same as _go'ixire_ : it repeats the last bridi but one. This is useful in conversation:
**Example 7.39. **
A: | mi | ba | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
A: | I | [future] | go-to | the | store.  
A: I am going to the store.  
---  
B: | mi | nelci | le | si'o | mi | go'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
B: | I | like | the | concept-of | I | [repeat-last-bridi].  
B: I like the idea of my going.  
---  
A: | do | go'e  
---|---|---  
A: | You | [repeat-last-bridi-but-one].  
A: You'll go, too.  
---  
  

Here B's sentence repeats A's within an abstraction (explained in Chapter 11): _le si'o mi go'i_ means _le si'o mi klama le zarci_. Why must B use the word __mi__ explicitly to replace the x1 of _mi klama le zarci_ , even though it looks like __mi__ is replacing __mi__? Because B's __mi__ refers to B, whereas A's __mi__ refers to A. If B said:
**Example 7.40. **
mi nelci le si'o go'i
  

that would mean:
> I like the idea of your going to the store.
The repetition signalled by __go'i__ is not literally of words, but of concepts. Finally, A repeats her own sentence, but with the x1 changed to __do__ , meaning B. Note that in Example 7.39, the tense __ba__ (future time) is carried along by both __go'i__ and __go'e__.
Descriptions based on go'i-series cmavo can be very useful for repeating specific sumti of previous bridi:
**Example 7.41. **
le | xekri | mlatu | cu | klama | le | zarci | .i | le  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | black | cat |  | goes-to | the | store. |  | That-described-as-the-x1-place-of  
go'i | cu | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---  
[repeat-last-bridi] |  | walks-on | the | ice.  
The black cat goes to the store. It walks on the ice.  
---  
  

Here the __go'i__ repeats _le xekri mlatu cu klama le zarci_ , and since __le__ makes the x1 place into a description, and the x1 place of this bridi is _le xekri mlatu_ , _le go'i_ means _le xekri mlatu_.
The cmavo __go'o__ , __nei__ , and __no'a__ have been little used so far. They repeat respectively some future bridi, the current bridi, and the bridi that encloses the current bridi (__no'a__ , unlike the other members of the go'i- series, can repeat non-sentence bridi). Here are a few examples:
**Example 7.42. **
mi | nupre | le | nu | mi | go'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | promise | the | event-of | I | [repeat-future-bridi].  
.i | ba | dunda | le | djini |  | le | bersa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [Future] | give | the | money | to | the | son  
.i | ba | dunda | le | zdani |  | le | tixnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| [Future] | give | the | house | to | the | daughter  
I promise to do the following: Give the money to my son. Give the house to my daughter.  
---  
  

(Note: The Lojban does not contain an equivalent of the __my__ in the colloquial English; it leaves the fact that it is the speaker's son and daughter that are referred to implicit. To make the fact explicit, use _le bersa_ /_tixnu be mi_.)
For good examples of __nei__ and __no'a__ , we need nested bridi contexts:
**Example 7.43. **
mi | se | pluka | le | nu | do | pensi | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | am-pleased-by | the | event-of | (you | think-about | the | (event-of  
nei | kei | pu | le | nu | do | zukte  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[main-bridi] | ) | before | the | (event-of | your | acting).  
I am pleased that you thought about whether I would be pleased (about ...) before you acted.  
---  
  

**Example 7.44. **
mi | ba | klama | ca | le | nu | do | no'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | go | [present] | the | event-of | you | [repeats outer bridi]  
I will go when you do.  
---  
  

Finally, __ra'o__ is a cmavo that can be appended to any go'i-series cmavo, or indeed any cmavo of selma'o GOhA, to signal that pro-sumti or pro-bridi cmavo in the antecedent are to be repeated literally and reinterpreted in their new context. Normally, any pro-sumti used within the antecedent of the pro-bridi keep their meanings intact. In the presence of __ra'o__ , however, their meanings must be reinterpreted with reference to the new environment. If someone says to you:
**Example 7.45. **
mi ba lumci le mi karce  
---  
I will wash my car.  
---  
  

you might reply either:
**Example 7.46. **
mi go'i  
---  
I will wash your car.  
---  
  

or:
**Example 7.47. **
mi go'i ra'o  
---  
I will wash my car.  
---  
  

The __ra'o__ forces the second __mi__ from the original bridi to mean the new speaker rather than the former speaker. This means that _go'e ra'o_ would be an acceptable alternative to _do go'e_ in B's statement in Example 7.39.
The anaphoric pro-sumti of this section can be used in quotations, but never refer to any of the supporting text outside the quotation, since speakers presumably do not know that they may be quoted by someone else.
However, a _ri-_ series or _go'a-_ series reference within a quotation can refer to something mentioned in an earlier quotation if the two quotations are closely related in time and context. This allows a quotation to be broken up by narrative material without interfering with the pro-sumti within it. Here's an example:
**Example 7.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | lu | mi | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | says | [quote] | I | go-to | the | store | [unquote].  
.i | la | .alis. | cusku | lu | mi | go'i | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| That-named | Alice | says | [quote] | I | [repeat] | [unquote].  
John says, “I am going to the store.” Alice says, “Me too.”  
---  
  

Of course, there is no problem with narrative material referring to something within a quotation: people who quote, unlike people who are quoted, are aware of what they are doing.
