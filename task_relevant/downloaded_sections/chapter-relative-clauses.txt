# Chapter 8. Relative Clauses, Which Make sumti Even More Complicated
## 8.1. What are you pointing at?
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
poi |  NOI |  restrictive relative clause introducer  
---|---|---  
ke'a |  GOhA |  relative pro-sumti  
ku'o |  KUhO |  relative clause terminator  
Let us think about the problem of communicating what it is that we are pointing at when we are pointing at something. In Lojban, we can refer to what we are pointing at by using the pro-sumti __ti__ if it is nearby, or __ta__ if it is somewhat further away, or __tu__ if it is distant. (Pro-sumti are explained in full in Chapter 7.)
However, even with the assistance of a pointing finger, or pointing lips, or whatever may be appropriate in the local culture, it is often hard for a listener to tell just what is being pointed at. Suppose one is pointing at a person (in particular, in the direction of his or her face), and says:
**Example 8.1. **
ti | cu | barda  
---|---|---  
This-one |  | is-big.  
  

What is the referent of __ti__? Is it the person? Or perhaps it is the person's nose? Or even (for __ti__ can be plural as well as singular, and mean “these ones” as well as “this one”) the pores on the person's nose?
To help solve this problem, Lojban uses a construction called a “relative clause”. Relative clauses are usually attached to the end of sumti, but there are other places where they can go as well, as explained later in this chapter. A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable terminator __ku'o__ (of selma'o KUhO). As you might suppose, __noi__ is a cmavo of selma'o NOI; however, first we will discuss the cmavo __poi__ , which also belongs to selma'o NOI.
In between the __poi__ and the __ku'o__ appears a full bridi, with the same syntax as any other bridi. Anywhere within the bridi of a relative clause, the pro-sumti __ke'a__ (of selma'o KOhA) may be used, and it stands for the sumti to which the relative clause is attached (called the “relativized sumti”). Here are some examples before we go any further:
**Example 8.2. **
ti | poi | ke'a | prenu | ku'o | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | such-that-( | IT | is-a-person | ) |  | is-large.  
This thing which is a person is big.  
---  
This person is big.  
  

**Example 8.3. **
ti | poi | ke'a | nazbi | ku'o | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | such-that-( | IT | is-a-nose | ) |  | is-large.  
This thing which is a nose is big.  
---  
This nose is big.  
  

**Example 8.4. **
ti | poi | ke'a | nazbi |  | kapkevna | ku'o | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | such-that-( | IT | is-a-nose | type-of | skin-hole | ) |  | is-big.  
These things which are nose-pores are big.  
---  
These nose-pores are big.  
  

In the literal translations throughout this chapter, the word “IT”, capitalized, is used to represent the cmavo __ke'a__. In each case, it serves to represent the sumti (in Example 8.2 through Example 8.4, the cmavo __ti__) to which the relative clause is attached.
Of course, there is no reason why __ke'a__ needs to appear in the x1 place of a relative clause bridi; it can appear in any place, or indeed even in a sub-bridi within the relative clause bridi. Here are two more examples:
**Example 8.5. **
tu | poi | le | mlatu | pu | lacpu | ke'a | ku'o | cu | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-distant-thing | such-that-( | the | cat | [past] | drags | IT | ) |  | is-a-rat.  
That thing which the cat dragged is a rat.  
---  
What the cat dragged is a rat.  
  

**Example 8.6. **
ta | poi | mi | djica | le | nu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-thing | such-that-( | I | desire | the | event-of(  
mi | ponse | ke'a | [kei] | ku'o | cu | bloti  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | own | IT | ) | ) |  | is-a-boat.  
That thing that I want to own is a boat.  
---  
  

In Example 8.6, __ke'a__ appears in an abstraction clause (abstractions are explained in Chapter 11) within a relative clause.
Like any sumti, __ke'a__ can be omitted. The usual presumption in that case is that it then falls into the x1 place:
**Example 8.7. **
ti | poi | nazbi | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | which | is-a-nose |  | is-big.  
  

almost certainly means the same thing as Example 8.3. However, __ke'a__ can be omitted if it is clear to the listener that it belongs in some place other than x1:
**Example 8.8. **
tu | poi | le | mlatu | pu | lacpu | cu | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-distant-thing | which | the | cat | [past] | drags |  | is-a-rat  
  

is equivalent to Example 8.4.
As stated before, __ku'o__ is an elidable terminator, and in fact it is almost always elidable. Throughout the rest of this chapter, __ku'o__ will not be written in any of the examples unless it is absolutely required: thus, Example 8.2 can be written:
**Example 8.9. **
ti | poi | prenu | cu | barda  
---|---|---|---|---  
That | which | is-a-person |  | is-big.  
That person is big.  
---  
  

without any change in meaning. Note that __poi__ is translated “which” rather than “such-that” when __ke'a__ has been omitted from the x1 place of the relative clause bridi. The word “which” is used in English to introduce English relative clauses: other words that can be used are “who” and “that”, as in:
**Example 8.10. **
I saw a man who was going to the store.
  

and
**Example 8.11. **
The building that the school was located in is large.
  

In Example 8.10 the relative clause is “who was going to the store”, and in Example 8.11 it is “that the school was located in”. Sometimes “who”, “which”, and “that” are used in literal translations in this chapter in order to make them read more smoothly.
