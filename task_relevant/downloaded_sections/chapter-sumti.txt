# Chapter 6. To Speak Of Many Things: The Lojban sumti
## 6.1. The five kinds of simple sumti
If you understand anything about Lojban, you know what a sumti is by now, right? An argument, one of those things that fills the places of simple Lojban sentences like:
**Example 6.1. **
mi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | market  
  

In Example 6.1, __mi__ and _le zarci_ are the sumti. It is easy to see that these two sumti are not of the same kind: __mi__ is a pro-sumti (the Lojban analogue of a pronoun) referring to the speaker, whereas _le zarci_ is a description which refers to something described as being a market.
There are five kinds of simple sumti provided by Lojban:
  1. descriptions like _le zarci_ , which usually begin with a descriptor (called a __gadri__ in Lojban) such as __le__ ;
  2. pro-sumti, such as __mi__ ;
  3. names, such as _la lojban._ , which usually begin with __la__ ;
  4. quotations, which begin with __lu__ , __le'u__ , __zo__ , or __zoi__ ;
  5. pure numbers, which usually begin with __li__.


Here are a few examples of each kind of sumti:
**Example 6.2. **
e'osai | ko | sarji | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---  
[request] [!] | You [imperative] | support | that-named | Lojban.  
Please support Lojban!  
---  
  

Example 6.2 exhibits __ko__ , a pro-sumti; and _la lojban._ , a name.
**Example 6.3. **
mi | cusku | lu | e'osai | li'u | le | tcidu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | [quote] | [request] [!] | [unquote] | to-the | reader.  
I express “Please!” to the reader.  
---  
  

Example 6.3 exhibits __mi__ , a pro-sumti; _lu e'osai li'u_ , a quotation; and _le tcidu_ , a description.
**Example 6.4. **
ti | mitre | li | ci  
---|---|---|---  
This | measures-in-meters | the-number | three.  
This is three meters long.  
---  
  

Example 6.4 exhibits __ti__ , a pro-sumti; and _li ci_ , a number.
Most of this chapter is about descriptions, as they have the most complicated syntax and usage. Some attention is also given to names, which are closely interwoven with descriptions. Pro-sumti, numbers, and quotations are described in more detail in Chapter 7, Chapter 18, and Chapter 19 respectively, so this chapter only gives summaries of their forms and uses. See Section 6.13 through Section 6.15 for these summaries.
