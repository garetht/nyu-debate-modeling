## 6.5. Descriptors for typical objects
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
lo'e |  LE |  the typical  
---|---|---  
le'e |  LE |  the stereotypical  
As promised in Section 6.3, Lojban has a method for discriminating between “the lion” who lives in Africa and “the Englishman” who, generally speaking, doesn't live in Africa even though some Englishmen do. The descriptor __lo'e__ means “the typical”, as in
**Example 6.26. **
lo'e | cinfo | cu | xabju | le | fi'ortu'a  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-typical | lion |  | dwells-in | the | African-land.  
The lion dwells in Africa.  
---  
  

What is this “typical lion”? Surely it is not any particular lion, because no lion has all of the “typical” characteristics, and (worse yet) some characteristics that all real lions have can't be viewed as typical. For example, all real lions are either male or female, but it would be bizarre to suppose that the typical lion is either one. So the typical lion has no particular sex, but does have a color (golden brown), a residence (Africa), a diet (game), and so on. Likewise we can say that
**Example 6.27. **
lo'e | glipre | cu | xabju  
---|---|---|---  
The-typical | English-person |  | dwells-in  
le | fi'ortu'a | na.e | le | gligugde  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | African-land | (Not!) and | the | English-country.  
The typical English person dwells not in Africa but in England.  
---  
  

The relationship between _lo'e cinfo_ and _lo'i cinfo_ may be explained thus: the typical lion is an imaginary lion-abstraction which best exemplifies the set of lions. There is a similar relationship between __le'e__ and __le'i__ :
**Example 6.28. **
le'e | xelso | merko | cu | gusta | ponse  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-stereotypical | Greek-type-of | American |  | is-a-restaurant-type-of | owner.  
Lots of Greek-Americans own restaurants.  
---  
  

Here we are concerned not with the actual set of Greek-Americans, but with the set of those the speaker has in mind, which is typified by one (real or imaginary) who owns a restaurant. The word “stereotypical” is often derogatory in English, but __le'e__ need not be derogatory in Lojban: it simply suggests that the example is typical in the speaker's imagination rather than in some objectively agreed-upon way. Of course, different speakers may disagree about what the features of “the typical lion” are (some would include having a short intestine, whereas others would know nothing of lions' intestines), so the distinction between _lo'e cinfo_ and _le'e cinfo_ may be very fine.
Furthermore,
**Example 6.29. **
le'e | skina | cu | se finti | ne'i | la | xali,uyd.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-stereotypical | movie |  | is-invented | in | that-named | Hollywood.  
  

is probably true to an American, but might be false (not the stereotype) to someone living in India or Russia.
Note that there is no naming equivalent of __lo'e__ and __le'e__ , because there is no need, as a rule, for a “typical George” or a “typical Smith”. People or things who share a common name do not, in general, have any other common attributes worth mentioning.
