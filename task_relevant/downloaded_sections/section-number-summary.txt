## 6.15. Number summary
The sumti which refer to numbers consist of the cmavo __li__ (of selma'o LI) followed by an arbitrary Lojban mekso, or mathematical expression. This can be anything from a simple number up to the most complicated combination of numbers, variables, operators, and so on. Much more information on numbers is given in Chapter 18. Here are a few examples of increasing complexity:
**Example 6.95. **
li | vo  
---|---  
the-number | four  
4  
  

**Example 6.96. **
li | re | su'i | re  
---|---|---|---  
the-number | two | plus | two  
2 + 2  
  

**Example 6.97. **
li | .abu | bi'epi'i | xy. | bi'ete'a | re | su'i | by. | bi'epi'i | xy. | su'i | cy.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | a | times | x | to-power | 2 | plus | b | times | x | plus | c  
ax2 \+ bx + c  
  

An alternative to __li__ is __me'o__ , also of selma'o LI. Number expressions beginning with __me'o__ refer to the actual expression, rather than its value. Thus Example 6.95 and Example 6.96 above have the same meaning, the number four, whereas
**Example 6.98. **
me'o | vo  
---|---  
the-expression | four  
“4”  
---  
  

and
**Example 6.99. **
me'o | re | su'i | re  
---|---|---|---  
the-expression | two | plus | two  
“2+2”  
---  
  

refer to different pieces of text.
The implicit quantifier for numbers and mathematical expressions is __su'o__ , because these sumti are analogous to __lo__ descriptions: they refer to things which actually are numbers or pieces of text. In the case of numbers (with __li__), this is a distinction without a difference, as there is only one number which is 4; but there are many texts “4”, as many as there are documents in which that numeral appears.
