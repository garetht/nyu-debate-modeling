## 17.9. lerfu words as pro-sumti
So far, lerfu words have only appeared in Lojban text when spelling out words. There are several other grammatical uses of lerfu words within Lojban. In each case, a single lerfu word or more than one may be used. Therefore, the term “lerfu string” is introduced: it is short for “sequence of one or more lerfu words”.
A lerfu string may be used as a pro-sumti (a sumti which refers to some previous sumti), just like the pro-sumti __ko'a__ , __ko'e__ , and so on:
**Example 17.21. **
.abu prami by.  
---  
A loves B  
---  
  

In Example 17.21, __.abu__ and __by.__ represent specific sumti, but which sumti they represent must be inferred from context.
Alternatively, lerfu strings may be assigned by __goi__ , the regular pro-sumti assignment cmavo:
**Example 17.22. **
le gerku goi gy. cu xekri .i gy. klama le zdani  
---  
The dog, or G, is black. G goes to the house.  
---  
  

There is a special rule that sometimes makes lerfu strings more advantageous than the regular pro-sumti cmavo. If no assignment can be found for a lerfu string (especially a single lerfu word), it can be assumed to refer to the most recent sumti whose name or description begins in Lojban with that lerfu. So Example 17.22 can be rephrased:
**Example 17.23. **
le gerku cu xekri. .i gy. klama le zdani  
---  
The dog is black. G goes to the house.  
---  
  

(A less literal English translation would use “D” for “dog” instead.)
Here is an example using two names and longer lerfu strings:
**Example 17.24. **
la | stivn. | mark. | djonz. | merko  
---|---|---|---|---  
| Steven | Mark | Jones | is-American.  
.i | la | .aleksandr. | paliitc. | kuzNIETsyf. | rusko  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
|  | Alexander | Pavlovitch | Kuznetsov | is-Russian.  
.i | symyjy. | tavla | .abupyky. | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| SMJ | talks-to | APK | in |  | Lojban.  
  

Perhaps Alexander's name should be given as _ru'o.abupyky_ instead.
What about
**Example 17.25. **
.abu | dunda | by. | cy.  
---|---|---|---  
A | gives | B | C  
  

Does this mean that A gives B to C? No. _by. cy._ is a single lerfu string, although written as two words, and represents a single pro-sumti. The true interpretation is that A gives BC to someone unspecified. To solve this problem, we need to introduce the elidable terminator __boi__ (of selma'o BOI). This cmavo is used to terminate lerfu strings and also strings of numerals; it is required when two of these appear in a row, as here. (The other reason to use __boi__ is to attach a free modifier – subscript, parenthesis, or what have you – to a lerfu string.) The correct version is:
**Example 17.26. **
.abu [boi] dunda by. boi cy. [boi]  
---  
A gives B to C  
---  
  

where the two occurrences of __boi__ in brackets are elidable, but the remaining occurrence is not. Likewise:
**Example 17.27. **
xy. | boi | ro | [boi] | prenu | cu | prami  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
X |  | all |  | persons |  | loves.  
X loves everybody.  
---  
  

requires the first __boi__ to separate the lerfu string __xy.__ from the digit string __ro__.
