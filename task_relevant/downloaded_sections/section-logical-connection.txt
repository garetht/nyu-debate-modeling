## 5.6. Logical connection within tanru
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
je |  JA |  tanru logical “and”  
---|---|---  
ja |  JA |  tanru logical “or”  
joi |  JOI |  mixed mass “and”  
gu'e |  GUhA |  tanru forethought logical “and”  
gi |  GI |  forethought connection separator  
Consider the English phrase “big red dog”. How shall this be rendered as a Lojban tanru? The naive attempt:
**Example 5.39. **
barda |  | xunre |  | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
(big | type-of | red) | type-of | dog  
  

will not do, as it means a dog whose redness is big, in whatever way redness might be described as “big”. Nor is
**Example 5.40. **
barda |  | xunre | bo | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
big | type-of | (red | type-of | dog)  
  

much better. After all, the straightforward understanding of the English phrase is that the dog is big as compared with other dogs, not merely as compared with other red dogs. In fact, the bigness and redness are independent properties of the dog, and only obscure rules of English adjective ordering prevent us from saying “red big dog”.
The Lojban approach to this problem is to introduce the cmavo __je__ , which is one of the many equivalents of English “and”. A big red dog is one that is both big and red, and we can say:
**Example 5.41. **
barda | je | xunre |  | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
(big | and | red) | type-of | dog  
  

Of course,
**Example 5.42. **
xunre | je | barda |  | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
(red | and | big) | type-of | dog  
  

is equally satisfactory and means the same thing. As these examples indicate, joining two brivla with __je__ makes them a unit for tanru purposes. However, explicit grouping with __bo__ or __ke__ … __ke'e__ associates brivla more closely than __je__ does:
**Example 5.43. **
barda | je | pelxu | bo | xunre | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
(big | and | (yellow | type-of | red)) | dog  
barda | je | ke | pelxu |  | xunre | ke'e | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(big | and | ( | yellow | type-of | red) | ) | dog  
big yellowish-red dog  
---  
  

With no grouping indicators, we get:
**Example 5.44. **
barda | je | pelxu |  | xunre |  | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
((big | and | yellow) | type-of | red) | type-of | dog  
biggish- and yellowish-red dog  
---  
  

which again raises the question of Example 5.39: what does “biggish-red” mean?
Unlike __bo__ and __ke__ … __ke'e__ , __je__ is useful as well as merely legal within simple tanru. It may be used to partly resolve the ambiguity of simple tanru:
**Example 5.45. **
ta | blanu | je | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
that | is-blue | and | is-a-house  
  

definitely refers to something which is both blue and is a house, and not to any of the other possible interpretations of simple _blanu zdani_. Furthermore, _blanu zdani_ refers to something which is blue in the way that houses are blue; _blanu je zdani_ has no such implication – the blueness of a _blanu je zdani_ is independent of its houseness.
With the addition of __je__ , many more versions of “pretty little girls' school” are made possible: see Section 5.16 for a complete list.
A subtle point in the semantics of tanru like Example 5.41 needs special elucidation. There are at least two possible interpretations of:
**Example 5.46. **
ta | melbi | je | nixli |  | ckule  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-(beautiful | and | girl) | type-of | school.  
  

It can be understood as:
**Example 5.47. **
That is a girls' school and a beautiful school.
  

or as:
**Example 5.48. **
That is a school for things which are both girls and beautiful.
  

The interpretation specified by Example 5.47 treats the tanru as a sort of abbreviation for:
**Example 5.49. **
ta | ke | melbi |  | ckule | ke'e | je | ke | nixli |  | ckule | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-( | beautiful | type-of | school | ) | and | ( | girl | type-of | school | )  
  

whereas the interpretation specified by Example 5.48 does not. This is a kind of semantic ambiguity for which Lojban does not compel a firm resolution. The way in which the school is said to be of type “beautiful and girl” may entail that it is separately a beautiful school and a girls' school; but the alternative interpretation, that the members of the school are beautiful and girls, is also possible. Still another interpretation is:
**Example 5.50. **
That is a school for beautiful things and also for girls.
  

so while the logical connectives help to resolve the meaning of tanru, they by no means compel a single meaning in and of themselves.
In general, logical connectives within tanru cannot undergo the formal manipulations that are possible with the related logical connectives that exist outside tanru; see Section 14.12 for further details.
The logical connective __je__ is only one of the fourteen logical connectives that Lojban provides. Here are a few examples of some of the others:
**Example 5.51. **
le | bajra | cu | jinga | ja | te | jinga  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the runner(s) is/are winner(s) or loser(s).  
---  
  

**Example 5.52. **
blanu | naja | lenku | skapi  
---|---|---|---  
(blue | only-if | cold) | skin  
skin which is blue only if it is cold  
---  
  

**Example 5.53. **
xamgu | jo | tordu | nuntavla  
---|---|---|---  
(good | if-and-only-if | short) | speech  
speech which is good if (and only if) it is short  
---  
  

**Example 5.54. **
vajni | ju | pluka | nuntavla  
---|---|---|---  
(important | whether-or-not | pleasing) | event-of-talking  
speech which is important, whether or not it is pleasing  
---  
  

In Example 5.51, __ja__ is grammatically equivalent to __je__ but means “or” (more precisely, “and/or”). Likewise, __naja__ means “only if” in Example 5.52, __jo__ means “if and only if” in Example 5.53, and __ju__ means “whether or not” in Example 5.54.
Now consider the following example:
**Example 5.55. **
ricfu | je | blanu | jabo | crino  
---|---|---|---|---  
rich | and | (blue | or | green)  
  

which illustrates a new grammatical feature: the use of both __ja__ and __bo__ between tanru components. The two cmavo combine to form a compound whose meaning is that of __ja__ but which groups more closely; __ja__ __bo__ is to __ja__ as plain __bo__ is to no cmavo at all. However, both __ja__ and __ja__ __bo__ group less closely than __bo__ does:
**Example 5.56. **
ricfu | je | blanu | jabo | crino | bo | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
rich | and | (blue | or | green | - | blue)  
rich and (blue or greenish-blue)  
---  
  

An alternative form of Example 5.55 is:
**Example 5.57. **
ricfu | je | ke | blanu | ja | crino | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
rich | and | ( | blue | or | green | )  
  

In addition to the logical connectives, there are also a variety of non-logical connectives, grammatically equivalent to the logical ones. The only one with a well-understood meaning in tanru contexts is __joi__ , which is the kind of “and” that denotes a mixture:
**Example 5.58. **
ti | blanu | joi | xunre | bolci  
---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-(blue | and | red) | ball.  
  

The ball described is neither solely red nor solely blue, but probably striped or in some other way exhibiting a combination of the two colors. Example 5.58 is distinct from:
**Example 5.59. **
ti | blanu | xunre | bolci  
---|---|---|---  
This is a bluish-red ball  
---  
  

which would be a ball whose color is some sort of purple tending toward red, since __xunre__ is the more important of the two components. On the other hand,
**Example 5.60. **
ti | blanu | je | xunre | bolci  
---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-a-(blue | and | red) | ball  
  

is probably self-contradictory, seeming to claim that the ball is independently both blue and red at the same time, although some sensible interpretation may exist.
Finally, just as English “and” has the variant form “both ... and”, so __je__ between tanru components has the variant form __gu'e__ … __gi__ , where __gu'e__ is placed before the components and __gi__ between them:
**Example 5.61. **
gu'e | barda | gi | xunre |  | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
(both | big | and | red) | type-of | dog  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 5.41. For each logical connective related to __je__ , there is a corresponding connective related to __gu'e__ … __gi__ in a systematic way.
The portion of a __gu'e__ … __gi__ construction before the __gi__ is a full selbri, and may use any of the selbri resources including __je__ logical connections. After the __gi__ , logical connections are taken to be wider in scope than the __gu'e__ … __gi__ , which has in effect the same scope as __bo__ :
**Example 5.62. **
gu'e | barda | je | xunre | gi | gerku | ja | mlatu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(both | (big | and | red) | and | dog) | or | cat  
something which is either big, red, and a dog, or else a cat  
---  
  

leaves __mlatu__ outside the __gu'e__ … __gi__ construction. The scope of the __gi__ arm extends only to a single brivla or to two or more brivla connected with __bo__ or __ke__ … __ke'e__.
