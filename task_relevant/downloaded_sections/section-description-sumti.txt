## 2.10. Description sumti
Often we wish to talk about things other than the speaker, the listener and things we can point to. Let's say I want to talk about a talker other than __mi__. What I want to talk about would naturally fit into the first place of __tavla__. Lojban, it turns out, has an operator that pulls this first place out of a selbri and converts it to a sumti called a “description sumti”. The description sumti _le tavla ku_ means “the talker”, and may be used wherever any sumti may be used.
For example,
**Example 2.38. **
mi |  tavla |  do |  le tavla |  [ku]  
---|---|---|---|---  
  

means the same as
**Example 2.39. **
I talk to you about the talker
  

where “the talker” is presumably someone other than me, though not necessarily.
Similarly _le sutra tavla ku_ is “the fast talker”, and _le sutra te tavla ku_ is “the fast subject of talk” or “the subject of fast talk”. Which of these related meanings is understood will depend on the context in which the expression is used. The most plausible interpretation within the context will generally be assumed by a listener to be the intended one.
In many cases the word __ku__ may be omitted. In particular, it is never necessary in a description at the end of a sentence, so:
**Example 2.40. **
mi |  tavla |  do |  le tavla  
---|---|---|---  
I |  talk-to |  you |  about-the talker  
  

means exactly the same thing as Example 2.38.
There is a problem when we want to say “The fast one is talking.” The “obvious” translation _le sutra tavla_ turns out to mean “the fast talker”, and has no selbri at all. To solve this problem we can use the word __cu__ , which so far has always been optional, in front of the selbri.
The word __cu__ has no meaning, and exists only to mark the beginning of the selbri within the bridi, separating it from a previous sumti. It comes before any other part of the selbri, including other cmavo like __se__ or __te__. Thus:
**Example 2.41. **
le sutra tavla  
---  
The fast talker  
  

**Example 2.42. **
le sutra |  cu |  tavla  
---|---|---  
The fast one |  - |  is talking.  
  

**Example 2.43. **
le sutra se tavla  
---  
The fast talked-to one  
  

**Example 2.44. **
le sutra |  cu |  se tavla  
---|---|---  
The fast one |  - |  is talked to.  
  

Consider the following more complex example, with two description sumti.
**Example 2.45. **
mi |  [cu] |  tavla |  le vecnu |  [ku] |  le blari'o |  [ku]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I |  - |  talk-to |  the seller |  - |  about the blue-green-thing. |  -  
  

The sumti _le vecnu_ contains the selbri __vecnu__ , which has the “seller” in the x1 place, and uses it in this sentence to describe a particular “seller” that the speaker has in mind (one that he or she probably expects the listener will also know about). Similarly, the speaker has a particular blue-green thing in mind, which is described using __le__ to mark __blari'o__ , a selbri whose first sumti is something blue-green.
It is safe to omit both occurrences of __ku__ in Example 2.45, and it is also safe to omit the __cu__.
