## 9.10. Modal relative phrases; Comparison
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
pe |  GOI |  restrictive relative phrase  
---|---|---  
ne |  GOI |  incidental relative phrase  
mau |  BAI |  zmadu modal  
me'a |  BAI |  mleca modal  
Relative phrases and clauses are explained in much more detail in Chapter 8. However, there is a construction which combines a modal with a relative phrase which is relevant to this chapter. Consider the following examples of relative clauses:
**Example 9.64. **
la | .apasionatas. | poi | se cusku  
---|---|---|---  
The | Appassionata | which | is-expressed-by  
la | .artr. | rubnstain. | cu | se nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Arthur | Rubinstein |  | is-liked-by | me.  
  

**Example 9.65. **
la | .apasionatas. | noi | se finti  
---|---|---|---  
The | Appassionata, | which | is-created-by  
la | betovn. | cu | se nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Beethoven, |  | is-liked-by | me.  
  

In Example 9.64, _la .apasionatas._ refers to a particular performance of the sonata, namely the one performed by Rubinstein. Therefore, the relative clause _poi se cusku_ uses the cmavo __poi__ (of selma'o NOI) to restrict the meaning of _la .apasionatas_ to the performance in question.
In Example 9.65, however, _la .apasionatas._ refers to the sonata as a whole, and the information that it was composed by Beethoven is merely incidental. The cmavo __noi__ (also of selma'o NOI) expresses the incidental nature of this relationship.
The cmavo __pe__ and __ne__ (of selma'o GOI) are roughly equivalent to __poi__ and __noi__ respectively, but are followed by sumti rather than full bridi. We can abbreviate Example 9.64 and Example 9.65 to:
**Example 9.66. **
la | .apasionatas. | pe | la | .artr. | rubnstain. | se nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | Appassionata | of | that-named | Arthur | Rubinstein | is-liked-by | me.  
  

**Example 9.67. **
la | .apasionatas. | ne | la | betovn. | se nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | Appassionata, | which-is-of | that-named | Beethoven, | is-liked-by | me.  
  

Here the precise selbri of the relative clauses is lost: all we can tell is that the Appassionata is connected in some way with Rubinstein (in Example 9.66) and Beethoven (in Example 9.67), and that the relationships are respectively restrictive and incidental.
It happens that both __cusku__ and __finti__ have BAI cmavo, namely __cu'u__ and __fi'e__. We can recast Example 9.66 and Example 9.67 as:
**Example 9.68. **
la | .apasionatas | pe cu'u  
---|---|---  
The | Appassionata | expressed-by  
la | .artr. | rubnstain. | cu | se nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Arthur | Rubinstein |  | is-liked-by | me.  
  

**Example 9.69. **
la | .apasionatas | ne fi'e  
---|---|---  
The | Appassionata, | invented-by  
la | betovn. | cu | se nelci | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | Beethoven, |  | is-liked-by | me.  
  

Example 9.68 and Example 9.69 have the full semantic content of Example 9.64 and Example 9.65 respectively.
Modal relative phrases are often used with the BAI cmavo __mau__ and __me'a__ , which are based on the comparative gismu __zmadu__ (more than) and __mleca__ (less than) respectively. The place structures are:
_ _zmadu_ _ |  x1 is more than x2 in property/quantity x3 by amount x4  
---|---  
_ _mleca_ _ |  x1 is less than x2 in property/quantity x3 by amount x4  
Here are some examples:
**Example 9.70. **
la | frank. | nelci | la | betis.  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | likes | that-named | Betty,  
ne | semau | la | meiris.  
---|---|---|---  
which-is | more-than | that-named | Mary.  
Frank likes Betty more than (he likes) Mary.  
---  
  

Example 9.70 requires that Frank likes Betty, but adds the information that his liking for Betty exceeds his liking for Mary. The modal appears in the form __semau__ because the x2 place of __zmadu__ is the basis for comparison: in this case, Frank's liking for Mary.
**Example 9.71. **
la | frank. | nelci | la | meiris.  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | likes | that-named | Mary,  
ne | seme'a | la | betis.  
---|---|---|---  
which-is | less-than | that-named | Betty.  
Frank likes Mary less than (he likes) Betty.  
---  
  

Here we are told that Frank likes Mary less than he likes Betty; the information about the comparison is the same. It would be possible to rephrase Example 9.70 using __me'a__ rather than __semau__ , and Example 9.71 using __mau__ rather than __seme'a__ , but such usage would be unnecessarily confusing. Like many BAI cmavo, __mau__ and __me'a__ are more useful when converted with __se__.
If the __ne__ were omitted in Example 9.70 and Example 9.71, the modal sumti (_la meiris._ and _la betis._ respectively) would become attached to the bridi as a whole, producing a very different translation. Example 9.71 would become:
**Example 9.72. **
la | frank. | nelci | la | meiris. | seme'a | la | betis.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | likes | that-named | Mary | is-less-than | that-named | Betty.  
Frank's liking Mary is less than Betty.  
---  
  

which compares a liking with a person, and is therefore nonsense.
Pure comparison, which states only the comparative information but says nothing about whether Frank actually likes either Mary or Betty (he may like neither, but dislike Betty less), would be expressed differently, as:
**Example 9.73. **
le | ni | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
The | quantity-of | that-named | Frank's  
nelci | la | betis. | cu  
---|---|---|---  
liking | that-named | Betty |   
zmadu | le | ni | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---|---  
is-more-than | the | quantity-of | that-named | Frank's  
nelci | la | meiris.  
---|---|---  
liking | that-named | Mary.  
  

The mechanisms explained in this section are appropriate to many modals other than __semau__ and __seme'a__. Some other modals that are often associated with relative phrases are: __seba'i__ (“instead of”), __ci'u__ (“on scale”), __de'i__ (“dated”), __du'i__ (“as much as”). Some BAI tags can be used equally well in relative phrases or attached to bridi; others seem useful only attached to bridi. But it is also possible that the usefulness of particular BAI modals is an English-speaker bias, and that speakers of other languages may find other BAIs useful in divergent ways.
Note: The uses of modals discussed in this section are applicable both to BAI modals and to _fi'o-_ plus-selbri modals.
