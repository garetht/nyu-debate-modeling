## 19.10. More on quotations: ZO, ZOI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
zo |  ZO |  quote single word  
---|---|---  
zoi |  ZOI |  non-Lojban quotation  
la'o |  ZOI |  non-Lojban name  
The cmavo __zo__ (of selma'o ZO) is a strong quotation mark for the single following word, which can be any Lojban word whatsoever. Among other uses, __zo__ allows a metalinguistic word to be referenced without having it act on the surrounding text. The word must be a morphologically legal (but not necessarily meaningful) single Lojban word; compound cmavo are not permitted. For example:
**Example 19.48. **
zo si cu lojbo valsi  
---  
__si__ is a Lojbanic word.  
---  
  

Since __zo__ acts on a single word only, there is no corresponding terminator. Brevity, then, is a great advantage of __zo__ , since the terminators for other kinds of quotation are rarely or never elidable.
The cmavo __zoi__ (of selma'o ZOI) is a quotation mark for quoting non-Lojban text. Its syntax is _zoi X. text .X_ , where X is a Lojban word (called the delimiting word) which is separated from the quoted text by pauses, and which is not found in the written text or spoken phoneme stream. It is common, but not required, to use the lerfu word (of selma'o BY) which corresponds to the Lojban name of the language being quoted:
**Example 19.49. **
zoi gy. John is a man .gy. cu glico jufra  
---  
“John is a man” is an English sentence.  
---  
  

where __gy__ stands for __glico__. Other popular choices of delimiting words are _.kuot._ , a Lojban name which sounds like the English word “quote”, and the word __zoi__ itself. Another possibility is a Lojban word suggesting the topic of the quotation.
Within written text, the Lojban written word used as a delimiting word may not appear, whereas within spoken text, the sound of the delimiting word may not be uttered. This leads to occasional breakdowns of audio-visual isomorphism: Example 19.50 is fine in speech but ungrammatical as written, whereas Example 19.51 is correct when written but ungrammatical in speech.
**Example 19.50. **
mi djuno fi le valsi po'u zoi gy. gyrations .gy.  
---  
I know about the word which-is “gyrations”.  
---  
  

**Example 19.51. **
mi djuno fi le valsi po'u zoi jai. gyrations .jai  
---  
I know about the word which-is “gyrations”.  
---  
  

The text __gy__ appears in the written word “gyrations”, whereas the sound represented in Lojban by __jai__ appears in the spoken word “gyrations”. Such borderline cases should be avoided as a matter of good style.
It should be noted particularly that __zoi__ quotation is the only way to quote rafsi, specifically CCV rafsi, because they are not Lojban words, and __zoi__ quotation is the only way to quote things which are not Lojban words. (CVC and CVV rafsi look like names and cmavo respectively, and so can be quoted using other methods.) For example:
**Example 19.52. **
zoi ry. sku .ry. cu rafsi zo cusku  
---  
“ _sku_ ” is a rafsi of “ __cusku__ ”.  
---  
  

(A minor note on interaction between _lo'u ... le'u_ and __zoi__ : The text between __lo'u__ and __le'u__ should consist of Lojban words only. In fact, non-Lojban material in the form of a __zoi__ quotation may also appear. However, if the word __le'u__ is used either as the delimiting word for the __zoi__ quotation, or within the quotation itself, the outer __lo'u__ quotation will be prematurely terminated. Therefore, __le'u__ should be avoided as the delimiting word in any __zoi__ quotation.)
Lojban strictly avoids any confusion between things and the names of things:
**Example 19.53. **
zo | .bab. | cmene | la | bab.  
---|---|---|---|---  
The-word |  “Bob” | is-the-name-of | the-one-named | Bob.  
  

In Example 19.53, _zo .bab._ is the word, whereas _la bab._ is the thing named by the word. The cmavo __la'e__ and __lu'e__ (of selma'o LAhE) convert back and forth between references and their referents:
**Example 19.54. **
zo | .bab. | cmene | la'e | zo | .bab.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-word |  “Bob” | is-the-name-of | the-referent-of | the-word |  “Bob” | .  
  

**Example 19.55. **
lu'e | la | bab. | cmene | la | bab.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
A-symbol-for |  | Bob | is-the-name-of |  | Bob.  
  

Example 19.53 through Example 19.55 all mean approximately the same thing, except for differences in emphasis. Example 19.56 is different:
**Example 19.56. **
la bab. cmene la bab.  
---  
Bob is the name of Bob.  
---  
  

and says that Bob is both the name and the thing named, an unlikely situation. People are not names.
(In Example 19.53 through Example 19.54, the name _bab._ was separated from a preceding __zo__ by a pause, thus: _zo .bab._. The reason for this extra pause is that all Lojban names must be separated by pause from any preceding word other than __la__ , __lai__ , __la'i__ (all of selma'o LA) and __doi__ (of selma'o DOI). There are numerous other cmavo that may precede a name: of these, __zo__ is one of the most common.)
The cmavo __la'o__ also belongs to selma'o ZOI, and is mentioned here for completeness, although it does not signal the beginning of a quotation. Instead, __la'o__ serves to mark non-Lojban names, especially the Linnaean binomial names (such as “Homo sapiens”) which are the internationally standardized names for species of animals and plants. Internationally known names which can more easily be recognized by spelling rather than pronunciation, such as “Goethe”, can also appear in Lojban text with __la'o__ :
**Example 19.57. **
la'o dy. Goethe .dy. cu me la'o ly. Homo sapiens .ly.  
---  
Goethe is a Homo sapiens.  
---  
  

Using __la'o__ for all names rather than Lojbanizing, however, makes for very cumbersome text. A rough equivalent of __la'o__ might be _la me zoi_.
