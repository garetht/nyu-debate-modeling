## 11.7. Predication/sentence abstraction
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
du'u |  NU |  predication abstraction  
---|---|---  
There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:
**Example 11.42. **
I know that Frank is a fool.
  

How's that in Lojban? Let us try:
**Example 11.43. **
mi | djuno | le | nu | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the event of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can't be contained inside one's mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; Example 11.43 comes close to claiming that Frank's being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, Example 11.43 is an instance of improperly marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in Section 11.10).
Try again:
**Example 11.44. **
mi | djuno | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.  
---  
  

Closer. Example 11.44 says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn't say that he is one, as Example 11.42 does. To catch that nuance, we must say:
**Example 11.45. **
mi | djuno | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I know the predication that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a fool” is not a property of _le du'u_ abstraction, but of __djuno__ ; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, __djuno__ like __jei__ has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) Example 11.46 has no such implied assertion:
**Example 11.46. **
mi | kucli | le | du'u | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

and here __du'u__ could probably be replaced by __jei__ without much change in meaning:
**Example 11.47. **
mi | kucli | le | jei | la | frank. | cu | bebna | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I am curious about how true it is that Frank is a fool.  
---  
  

As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, __du'u__ has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:
> _ _du'u_ _ x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2
and _le se du'u ..._ is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:
**Example 11.48. **
la | djan. | cusku | le | se du'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses | the | (sentence-expressing-that  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | [kei]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes-to | the | store | )  
John says that George goes to the store.  
---  
  

Example 11.48 differs from
**Example 11.49. **
la | djan | cusku | lu  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | expresses, | quote,  
la | djordj. | klama | le | zarci | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | George | goes | to-the | store, | unquote.  
John says “George goes to the store”.  
---  
  

because Example 11.49 claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas Example 11.48 claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.
_le se du'u_ is much the same as _lu'e le du'u_ , a symbol for the predication, but _se du'u_ can be used as a selbri, whereas __lu'e__ is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See Section 6.10 for a discussion of __lu'e__.)
