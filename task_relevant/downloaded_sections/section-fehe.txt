## 10.11. Space interval modifiers: FEhE
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
fe'e |  FEhE |  space interval modifier flag  
---|---|---  
Like time intervals, space intervals can also be continuous, discontinuous, or repetitive. Rather than having a whole separate set of selma'o for space interval properties, we instead prefix the flag __fe'e__ to the cmavo used for time interval properties. A space interval property would be placed just after the space interval size and/or dimensionality cmavo:
**Example 10.65. **
ko | vi'i | fe'e | di'i | sombo | le | gurni  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You-imperative | [1-dimensional] | [space:] | [regularly] | sow | the | grain.  
Sow the grain in a line and evenly!  
---  
  

**Example 10.66. **
mi | fe'e | ciroi | tervecnu | lo | selsalta  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [space:] | [three-places] | buy | those-which-are | salad-ingredients.  
I buy salad ingredients in three locations.  
---  
  

**Example 10.67. **
ze'e | roroi | ve'e | fe'e | roroi | ku  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[whole-time] | [all-times] | [whole-space] | [space:] | [all-places] |   
li | re | su'i | re | du | li | vo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | 2 | + | 2 | = | the-number | 4.  
Always and everywhere, two plus two is four.  
---  
  

As shown in Example 10.67, when a tense comes first in a bridi, rather than in its normal position before the selbri (in this case __du__), it is emphasized.
The __fe'e__ marker can also be used for the same purpose before members of ZAhO. (The cmavo __be'a__ belongs to selma'o FAhA; it is the space direction meaning “north of”.)
**Example 10.68. **
tu | ve'abe'a | fe'e | co'a | rokci  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-yonder | [medium-space-interval-north] | [space] | [initiative] | is-a-rock.  
That is the beginning of a rock extending to my north.  
---  
That is the south face of a rock.  
  

Here the notion of a “beginning point” represented by the cmavo __co'a__ is transferred from “beginning in time” to “beginning in space” under the influence of the __fe'e__ flag. Space is not inherently oriented, unlike time, which flows from past to future: therefore, some indication of orientation is necessary, and the _ve'abe'a_ provides an orientation in which the south face is the “beginning” and the north face is the “end”, since the rock extends from south (near me) to north (away from me).
Many natural languages represent time by a space-based metaphor: in English, what is past is said to be “behind us”. In other languages, the metaphor is reversed. Here, Lojban is representing space (or space interval modifiers) by a time-based metaphor: the choice of a FAhA cmavo following a VEhA cmavo indicates which direction is mapped onto the future. (The choice of future rather than past is arbitrary, but convenient for English-speakers.)
If both a TAhE (or ROI) and a ZAhO are present as space interval modifiers, the __fe'e__ flag must be prefixed to each.
