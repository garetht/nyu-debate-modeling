## 18.2. Lojban numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
|  pa |  PA |  1  
---|---|---  
re |  PA |  2  
ci |  PA |  3  
vo |  PA |  4  
mu |  PA |  5  
|  xa |  PA |  6  
---|---|---  
ze |  PA |  7  
bi |  PA |  8  
so |  PA |  9  
no |  PA |  0  
The simplest kind of mekso are numbers, which are cmavo or compound cmavo. There are cmavo for each of the 10 decimal digits, and numbers greater than 9 are made by stringing together the cmavo. Some examples:
**Example 18.2. **
pa | re | ci  
---|---|---  
one | two | three  
123  
one hundred and twenty three  
---  
  

**Example 18.3. **
pa | no  
---|---  
one | zero  
10  
ten  
---  
  

**Example 18.4. **
pa | re | ci | vo | mu | xa | ze | bi | so | no  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
one | two | three | four | five | six | seven | eight | nine | zero  
1234567890  
one billion, two hundred and thirty-four million, five hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and ninety.  
---  
  

Therefore, there are no separate cmavo for “ten”, “hundred”, etc.
There is a pattern to the digit cmavo (except for __no__ , 0) which is worth explaining. The cmavo from 1 to 5 end in the vowels _a_ , _e_ , _i_ , _o_ , _u_ respectively; and the cmavo from 6 to 9 likewise end in the vowels _a_ , _e_ , _i_ , and _o_ respectively. None of the digit cmavo begin with the same consonant, to make them easy to tell apart in noisy environments.
