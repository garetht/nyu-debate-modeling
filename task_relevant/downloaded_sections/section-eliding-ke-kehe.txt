## 12.11. Eliding KE and KEhE rafsi from lujvo
People constructing lujvo usually want them to be as short as possible. To that end, they will discard any cmavo they regard as niceties. The first such cmavo to get thrown out are usually __ke__ and __ke'e__ , the cmavo used to structure and group tanru. We can usually get away with this, because the interpretation of the tertau with __ke__ and __ke'e__ missing is less plausible than that with the cmavo inserted, or because the distinction isn't really important.
For example, in __bakrecpa'o__ , meaning “beefsteak”, the veljvo is
**Example 12.49. **
[ke] | bakni | rectu | [ke'e] | panlo  
---|---|---|---|---  
( | bovine | meat | ) | slice  
  

because of the usual Lojban left-grouping rule. But there doesn't seem to be much difference between that veljvo and
**Example 12.50. **
bakni | ke | rectu | panlo | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
bovine | ( | meat | slice | )  
  

On the other hand, the lujvo __zernerkla__ , meaning “to sneak in”, almost certainly was formed from the veljvo
**Example 12.51. **
zekri | ke | nenri | klama | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
crime | ( | inside | go | )  
to go within, criminally  
---  
  

because the alternative,
**Example 12.52. **
[ke] | zekri | nenri | [ke'e] | klama  
---|---|---|---|---  
( | crime | inside | ) | go  
  

doesn't make much sense. (To go to the inside of a crime? To go into a place where it is criminal to be inside – an interpretation almost identical with Example 12.51 anyway?)
There are cases, however, where omitting a KE or KEhE rafsi can produce another lujvo, equally useful. For example, _xaskemcakcurnu_ means “oceanic shellfish”, and has the veljvo
**Example 12.53. **
xamsi |  | ke | calku | curnu  
---|---|---|---|---  
ocean | type-of | ( | shell | worm | )  
  

(“worm” in Lojban refers to any invertebrate), but _xasycakcurnu_ has the veljvo
**Example 12.54. **
[ke] | xamsi | calku | [ke'e] |  | curnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
( | ocean | shell | ) | type-of | worm  
  

and might refer to the parasitic worms that infest clamshells.
Such misinterpretation is more likely than not in a lujvo starting with _sel-_ (from __se__), _nal-_ (from __na'e__) or _tol-_ (from __to'e__): the scope of the rafsi will likeliest be presumed to be as narrow as possible, since all of these cmavo normally bind only to the following brivla or __ke__ … __ke'e__ group. For that reason, if we want to modify an entire lujvo by putting __se__ , __na'e__ or __to'e__ before it, it's better to leave the result as two words, or else to insert __ke__ , than to just stick the SE or NAhE rafsi on.
It is all right to replace the phrase _se klama_ with __selkla__ , and the places of __selkla__ are exactly those of _se klama_. But consider the related lujvo __dzukla__ , meaning “to walk to somewhere”. It is a symmmetrical lujvo, derived from the veljvo _cadzu klama_ as follows:
**Example 12.55. **
__cadzu__ : c1 walks on surface c2 using limbs c3
__klama__ : k1 goes to k2 from k3 via route k4 using k5
__dzukla__ : c1=k1 walks to k2 from k3 via route k4 using limbs k5=c3 on surface c2
  

We can swap the k1 and k2 places using _se dzukla_ , but we cannot directly make _se dzukla_ into _seldzukla_ , which would represent the veljvo _selcadzu klama_ and plausibly mean something like “to go to a walking surface”. Instead, we would need _selkemdzukla_ , with an explicit rafsi for __ke__. Similarly, _nalbrablo_ (from _na'e barda bloti_) means “non-big boat”, whereas _na'e brablo_ means “other than a big boat”.
If the lujvo we want to modify with SE has a seltau already starting with a SE rafsi, we can take a shortcut. For instance, __gekmau__ means “happier than”, while _selgekmau_ means “making people happier than, more enjoyable than, more of a 'se gleki' than”. If something is less enjoyable than something else, we can say it is _se selgekmau_.
But we can also say it is _selselgekmau_. Two __se__ cmavo in a row cancel each other (_se se gleki_ means the same as just __gleki__), so there would be no good reason to have _selsel_ in a lujvo with that meaning. Instead, we can feel free to interpret _selsel-_ as _selkemsel-_. The rafsi combinations _terter-_ , _velvel-_ and _xelxel-_ work in the same way.
Other SE combinations like _selter-_ , although they might conceivably mean _se te_ , more than likely should be interpreted in the same way, namely as _se ke te_ , since there is no need to re-order places in the way that _se te_ provides. (See Section 9.4.)
