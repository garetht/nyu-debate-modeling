## 13.7. Attitudinal modifiers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ga'i |  [galtu] |  hauteur; rank |  equal rank |  meekness; lack of rank  
---|---|---|---|---  
le'o |  |  aggressive |  passive |  defensive  
vu'e |  [vrude] |  virtue (__zabna__) |  |  sin (__mabla__)  
se'i |  [sevzi] |  self-orientation |  |  other-orientation  
ri'e |  [zifre] |  release |  restraint |  control  
fu'i |  [frili] |  with help; easily |  without help |  with opposition; with difficulty  
be'u |  |  lack/need |  presence/satisfaction |  satiation  
se'a |  [sevzi] |  self-sufficiency |  |  dependency  
It turned out that, once we had devised the six emotion categories, we also recognized some other commonalities among emotions. These tended to fit nicely on scales of their own, but generally tend not to be thought of as separate emotions. Some of these are self-explanatory, some need to be placed in context. Some of these tend to go well with only a few of the attitudinals, others go with nearly all of them. To really understand these modifiers, try to use them in combination with one or two of the attitudinals found in Section 13.2 and Section 13.3, and see what emotional pictures you can build:
The cmavo __ga'i__ expresses the scale used to indicate condescension or polite deference; it is not respect in general, which is __.io__. Whatever it is attached to is marked as being below (for __ga'i__) or above (for __ga'inai__) the speaker's rank or social position. Note that it is always the referent, not the speaker or listener, who is so marked: in order to mark the listener, the listener must appear in the sentence, as with _doi ga'inai_ , which can be appended to a statement addressed to a social superior.
**Example 13.48. **
ko | ga'inai | nenri | klama | le | mi | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You-imperative | [low-rank!] | enter-type-of | come-to | the | of-me | house.  
I would be honored if you would enter my residence.  
---  
  

Note that imperatives in Lojban need not be imperious! Corresponding examples with __ga'icu'i__ and __ga'i__ :
**Example 13.49. **
ko | ga'icu'i | nenri | klama | le | mi | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You-imperative | [equal-rank!] | enter-type-of | come-to | the | of-me | house.  
Come on in to my place.  
---  
  

**Example 13.50. **
ko | ga'i | nenri | klama | le | mi | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
You-imperative | [high-rank!] | enter-type-of | come-to | the | of-me | house.  
You! Get inside!  
---  
  

Since __ga'i__ expresses the relative rank of the speaker and the referent, it does not make much sense to attach it to __mi__ , unless the speaker is using __mi__ to refer to a group (as in English “we”), or a past or future version of himself with a different rank.
It is also possible to attach __ga'i__ to a whole bridi, in which case it expresses the speaker's superiority to the event the bridi refers to:
**Example 13.51. **
ga'i | le | xarju | pu | citka  
---|---|---|---|---  
[High-rank!] | the | pig | [past] | eats.  
The pig ate (which is an event beneath my notice).  
---  
  

When used without being attached to any bridi, __ga'i__ expresses the speaker's superiority to things in general, which may represent an absolute social rank: _ga'icai_ is an appropriate opening word for an emperor's address from the throne.
The cmavo __le'o__ represents the scale of aggressiveness. We seldom overtly recognize that we are feeling aggressive or defensive, but perhaps in counseling sessions, a psychologist might encourage someone to express these feelings on this scale. And football teams could be urged on by their coach using _ro'ole'o_. __le'o__ is also useful in threats as an alternative to _o'onai_ , which expresses anger.
The cmavo __vu'e__ represents ethical virtue or its absence. An excess of almost any emotion is usually somewhat “sinful” in the eyes of most ethical systems. On the other hand, we often feel virtuous about our feelings – what we call righteous indignation might be _o'onaivu'e_. Note that this is distinct from lack of guilt: __.u'unai__.
The cmavo __se'i__ expresses the difference between selfishness and generosity, for example (in combination with __.au__):
**Example 13.52. **
.ause'i  
---  
[desire-self]  
I want it!  
---  
  

**Example 13.53. **
.ause'inai  
---  
[desire-other]  
I want you to have it!  
---  
  

In both cases, the English “it” is vague, reflecting the absence of a bridi. Example 13.52 and Example 13.53 are pure expressions of attitude. Analogously, _.uuse'i_ is self-pity, whereas _.uuse'inai_ is pity for someone else.
The modifier __ri'e__ indicates emotional release versus emotional control. “I will not let him know how angry I am”, you say to yourself before entering the room. The Lojban is much shorter:
**Example 13.54. **
.o'onai | ri'enai  
---|---  
[anger] | [control]  
  

On the other hand, __ri'e__ can be used by itself to signal an emotional outburst.
The cmavo __fu'i__ may express a reason for feeling the way we do, as opposed to a feeling in itself; but it is a reason that is more emotionally determined than most. For example, it could show the difference between the mental discomfort mentioned in Section 13.6 when it is felt on an easy test, as opposed to on a hard test. When someone gives you a back massage, you could use _.o'ufu'i_ to show appreciation for the assistance in your comfort.
The cmavo __be'u__ expresses, roughly speaking, whether the emotion it modifies is in response to something you don't have enough of, something you have enough of, or something you have too much of. It is more or less the attitudinal equivalent of the subjective quantifier cmavo __mo'a__ , __rau__ , and __du'e__ (these belong to selma'o PA, and are discussed in Section 18.8). For example,
**Example 13.55. **
.uiro'obe'unai  
---  
[Yay-physical-enough!]  
  

might be something you say after a large meal which you enjoyed.
Like all modifiers, __be'u__ can be used alone:
**Example 13.56. **
le | cukta | be'u | cu | zvati | ma  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | book | [Needed!] |  | is-at-location | [what-sumti?]  
Where's the book? I need it!  
---  
  

Lastly, the modifier __se'a__ shows whether the feeling is associated with self-sufficiency or with dependence on others.
**Example 13.57. **
.e'ese'a  
---  
[I-can-self-sufficient!]  
I can do it all by myself!  
---  
  

is something a Lojban-speaking child might say. On the other hand,
**Example 13.58. **
.e'ese'anai  
---  
[I-can-dependent]  
I can do it if you help me.  
---  
  

from the same child would indicate a (hopefully temporary) loss of self-confidence. It is also possible to negate the __e'e__ in Example 13.54 and Example 13.55, leading to:
**Example 13.59. **
.e'enaise'a  
---  
[I-can't-self-sufficient]  
I can't do it if you insist on “helping” me!  
---  
  

and
**Example 13.60. **
.e'enaise'anai  
---  
[I-can't-dependent]  
I can't do it by myself!  
---  
  

Some of the emotional expressions may seem too complicated to use. They might be for most circumstances. It is likely that most combinations will never get used. But if one person uses one of these expressions, another person can understand (as unambiguously as the expresser intends) what emotion is being expressed. Most probably as the system becomes well-known and internalized by Lojban-speakers, particular attitudinal combinations will come to be standard expressions (if not cliches) of emotion.
