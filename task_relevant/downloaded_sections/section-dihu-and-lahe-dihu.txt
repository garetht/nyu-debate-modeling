## 2.12. The sumti _di'u_ and _la'e di'u_
In English, I might say “The dog is beautiful”, and you might reply “This pleases me.” How do you know what “this” refers to? Lojban uses different expressions to convey the possible meanings of the English:
**Example 2.50. **
le gerku |  [ku] |  cu |  melbi  
---|---|---|---  
The dog is beautiful.  
---  
  

The following three sentences all might translate as “This pleases me.”
**Example 2.51. **
ti |  [cu] |  pluka |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This (the dog) pleases me.  
---  
  

**Example 2.52. **
di'u |  [cu] |  pluka |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This (the last sentence) pleases me (perhaps because it is grammatical or sounds nice).  
---  
  

**Example 2.53. **
la'e di'u |  [cu] |  pluka |  mi  
---|---|---|---  
This (the meaning of the last sentence; i.e. that the dog is beautiful) pleases me.  
---  
  

Example 2.53 uses one sumti to point to or refer to another by inference. It is common to write __la'edi'u__ as a single word; it is used more often than __di'u__ by itself.
