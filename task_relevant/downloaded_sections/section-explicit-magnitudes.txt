## 10.25. Explicit magnitudes
It is a limitation of the VA and ZI system of specifying magnitudes that they can only prescribe vague magnitudes: small, medium, or large. In order to express both an origin point and an exact distance, the Lojban construction called a “termset” is employed. (Termsets are explained further in Section 14.11 and Section 16.7.) It is grammatical for a termset to be placed after a tense or modal tag rather than a sumti, which allows both the origin of the imaginary journey and its distance to be specified. Here is an example:
**Example 10.189. **
la | frank. | sanli | zu'a | nu'i | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | stands | [left] | [start-termset] |  | George  
la'u | lo | mitre | be | li | mu | [nu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[quantity] | a | thing-measuring-in-meters |  | the-number | 5 | [end-termset].  
Frank is standing five meters to the left of George.  
---  
  

Here the termset extends from the __nu'i__ to the implicit __nu'u__ at the end of the sentence, and includes the terms _la djordj._ , which is the unmarked origin point, and the tagged sumti _lo mitre be li mu_ , which the cmavo __la'u__ (of selma'o BAI, and meaning “with quantity”; see Section 9.6) marks as a quantity. Both terms are governed by the tag __zu'a__
It is not necessary to have both an origin point and an explicit magnitude: a termset may have only a single term in it. A less precise version of Example 10.189 is:
**Example 10.190. **
la | frank. | sanli | zu'a | nu'i | la'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | stands | [left] | [termset] | [quantity]  
lo | mitre | be | li | mu  
---|---|---|---|---  
a | thing-measuring-in-meters |  | the-number | 5.  
Frank stands five meters to the left.
