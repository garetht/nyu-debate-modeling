## 6.8. Indefinite descriptions
By a quirk of Lojban syntax, it is possible to omit the descriptor __lo__ , but never any other descriptor, from a description like that of Example 6.42; namely, one which has an explicit outer quantifier but no explicit inner quantifier. The following example:
**Example 6.44. **
ci | gerku | [ku] | cu | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---  
Three-of-those-which-are | dogs |  |  | are-white.  
Three dogs are white.  
---  
  

is equivalent in meaning to Example 6.42. Even though the descriptor is not present, the elidable terminator __ku__ may still be used. The name “indefinite description” for this syntactic form is historically based: of course, it is no more and no less indefinite than its counterpart with an explicit __lo__. Indefinite descriptions were introduced into the language in order to imitate the syntax of English and other natural languages.
Indefinite descriptions must fit this mold exactly: there is no way to make one which does not have an explicit outer quantifier (thus _*gerku cu blabi_ is ungrammatical), or which has an explicit inner quantifier (thus _*reboi ci gerku cu blabi_ is also ungrammatical – _re ci gerku cu blabi_ is fine, but means “23 dogs are white”).
Note: Example 6.32 also contains an indefinite description, namely _su'o ci cutci_ ; another version of that example using an explicit __lo__ would be:
**Example 6.45. **
mi | ponse | su'o | ci | lo | cutci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | possess | at-least | three | things-which-really-are | shoes  
I own three (or more) shoes.
