## 2.5. Some simple Lojban bridi
Let's look at a simple Lojban bridi. The place structure of the gismu __tavla__ is
**Example 2.7. **
x1 talks to x2 about x3 in language x4
  

where the “x” es with following numbers represent the various arguments that could be inserted at the given positions in the English sentence. For example:
**Example 2.8. **
John talks to Sam about engineering in Lojban.
  

has “John” in the x1 place, “Sam” in the x2 place, “engineering” in the x3 place, and “Lojban” in the x4 place, and could be paraphrased:
**Example 2.9. **
Talking is going on, with speaker John and listener Sam and subject matter engineering and language Lojban.
  

The Lojban bridi corresponding to Example 2.7 will have the form
**Example 2.10. **
x1 |  [cu] |  tavla |  x2 |  x3 |  x4  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
  

The word __cu__ serves as a separator between any preceding sumti and the selbri. It can often be omitted, as in the following examples.
**Example 2.11. **
mi |  tavla |  do |  zo'e |  zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
I talk to you about something in some language.  
---  
  

**Example 2.12. **
do |  tavla |  mi |  ta |  zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---  
You talk to me about that thing in a language.  
---  
  

**Example 2.13. **
mi |  tavla |  zo'e |  tu |  ti  
---|---|---|---|---  
I talk to someone about that thing yonder in this language.  
---  
  

(Example 2.13 is a bit unusual, as there is no easy way to point to a language; one might point to a copy of this book, and hope the meaning gets across!)
When there are one or more occurrences of the cmavo __zo'e__ at the end of a bridi, they may be omitted, a process called “ellipsis”. Example 2.11 and Example 2.12 may be expressed thus:
**Example 2.14. **
mi |  tavla |  do  
---|---|---  
I talk to you (about something in some language).  
---  
  

**Example 2.15. **
do |  tavla |  mi |  ta  
---|---|---|---  
You talk to me about that thing (in some language).  
---  
  

Note that Example 2.13 is not subject to ellipsis by this direct method, as the __zo'e__ in it is not at the end of the bridi.
