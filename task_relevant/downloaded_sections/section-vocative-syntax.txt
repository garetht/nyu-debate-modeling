## 6.11. The syntax of vocative phrases
Vocative phrases are not sumti, but are explained in this chapter because their syntax is very similar to that of sumti. Grammatically, a vocative phrase is one of the so-called “free modifiers” of Lojban, along with subscripts, parentheses, and various other constructs explained in Chapter 19. They can be placed after many, but not all, constructions of the grammar: in general, after any elidable terminator (which, however, must not then be elided!), at the beginnings and ends of sentences, and in many other places.
The purpose of a vocative phrase is to indicate who is being addressed, or to indicate to that person that he or she ought to be listening. A vocative phrase begins with a cmavo of selma'o COI or DOI, all of which are explained in more detail in Section 13.14. Sometimes that is all there is to the phrase:
**Example 6.62. **
coi  
---  
[greetings]  
Hello.  
---  
  

**Example 6.63. **
je'e  
---  
[acknowledgement]  
Uh-huh.  
---  
Roger!  
  

In these cases, the person being addressed is obvious from the context. However, a vocative word (more precisely, one or more cmavo of COI, possibly followed by __doi__ , or else just __doi__ by itself) can be followed by one of several kinds of phrases, all of which are intended to indicate the addressee. The most common case is a name:
**Example 6.64. **
coi. | djan.  
---|---  
[greetings] | John.  
Hello, John.  
---  
  

A pause is required (for morphological reasons) between a member of COI and a name. You can use __doi__ instead of a pause:
**Example 6.65. **
coi | doi | djan.  
---|---|---  
[greetings] | O | John.  
Hello, John.  
---  
  

means exactly the same thing and does not require a pause. Using __doi__ by itself is like just saying someone's name to attract his or her attention:
**Example 6.66. **
doi | djan.  
---|---  
O | John.  
John!  
---  
  

In place of a name, a description may appear, lacking its descriptor, which is understood to be __le__ :
**Example 6.67. **
coi | xunre | pastu | nixli  
---|---|---|---  
Hello, | (red-type-of | dress)-type-of | girl.  
Hello, girl with the red dress!  
---  
  

The listener need not really be a _xunre pastu nixli_ , as long as she understands herself correctly from the description. (Actually, only a bare selbri can appear; explicit quantifiers are forbidden in this form of vocative, so the implicit quantifiers _su'o le ro_ are in effect.)
Finally, a complete sumti may be used, the most general case.
**Example 6.68. **
co'o | la | bab. | .e | la | noras.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[partings] | that-named | Bob | and | that-named | Nora.  
Goodbye, Bob and Nora.  
---  
  

Example 6.67 is thus the same as:
**Example 6.69. **
coi | le | xunre | pastu | nixli  
---|---|---|---|---  
Hello, | the-one-described-as | (red-type-of | dress)-type-of | girl!  
  

and Example 6.66 is the same as:
**Example 6.70. **
doi | la | djan.  
---|---|---  
O | that-named | John!  
  

Finally, the elidable terminator for vocative phrases is __do'u__ (of selma'o DOhU), which is rarely needed except when a simple vocative word is being placed somewhere within a bridi. It may also be required when a vocative is placed between a sumti and its relative clause, or when there are a sequence of so-called “free modifiers” (vocatives, subscripts, utterance ordinals – see Chapter 18 – metalinguistic comments – see Section 19.12 – or reciprocals – see Chapter 19) which must be properly separated.
The meaning of a vocative phrase that is within a sentence is not affected by its position in the sentence: thus Example 6.70 and Example 6.71 mean the same thing:
**Example 6.71. **
doi | djan. | ko | klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
O | John | you [imperative] | go-to | me.  
John, come to me!  
---  
  

**Example 6.72. **
ko | klama | mi | doi | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---  
You [imperative] | go-to | me | O | John.  
Come to me, John!  
---  
  

As usual for this chapter, the full syntax of vocative phrases has not been explained: relative clauses, discussed in Chapter 8, make for more possibilities.
