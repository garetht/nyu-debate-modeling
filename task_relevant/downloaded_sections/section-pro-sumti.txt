## 6.13. Pro-sumti summary
The Lojban pro-sumti are the cmavo of selma'o KOhA. They fall into several classes: personal, definable, quantificational, reflexive, back-counting, indefinite, demonstrative, metalinguistic, relative, question. More details are given in Chapter 7; this section mostly duplicates information found there, but adds material on the implicit quantifier of each pro-sumti.
The following examples illustrate each of the classes. Unless otherwise noted below, the implicit quantification for pro-sumti is __ro__ (all). In the case of pro-sumti which refer to other sumti, the __ro__ signifies “all of those referred to by the other sumti”: thus it is possible to restrict, but not to extend, the quantification of the other sumti.
Personal pro-sumti (__mi__ , __do__ , __mi'o__ , __mi'a__ , __ma'a__ , __do'o__ , __ko__) refer to the speaker or the listener or both, with or without third parties:
**Example 6.81. **
mi | prami | do  
---|---|---  
I | love | you.  
  

The personal pro-sumti may be interpreted in context as either representing individuals or masses, so the implicit quantifier may be __pisu'o__ rather than __ro__ : in particular, __mi'o__ , __mi'a__ , __ma'a__ , and __do'o__ specifically represent mass combinations of the individuals (you and I, I and others, you and I and others, you and others) that make them up.
Definable pro-sumti (__ko'a__ , __ko'e__ , __ko'i__ , __ko'o__ , __ko'u__ , __fo'a__ , __fo'e__ , __fo'i__ , __fo'o__ , __fo'u__) refer to whatever the speaker has explicitly made them refer to. This reference is accomplished with __goi__ (of selma'o GOI), which means “defined-as”.
**Example 6.82. **
le | cribe | goi | ko'a | cu | xekri | .i | ko'a | citka | le | smacu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | bear | defined-as | it-1 |  | is-black. |  | It-1 | eats | the | mouse.  
  

Quantificational pro-sumti (__da__ , __de__ , __di__) are used as variables in bridi involving predicate logic:
**Example 6.83. **
ro | da | poi | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
All | somethings-1 | which | are-persons  
cu | prami | pa | de | poi | finpe  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| love | one | something-2 | which | is-a-fish.  
All persons love a fish (each his/her own).  
---  
  

(This is not the same as “All persons love a certain fish”; the difference between the two is one of quantifier order.) The implicit quantification rules for quantificational pro-sumti are particular to them, and are discussed in detail in Chapter 16. Roughly speaking, the quantifier is __su'o__ (at least one) when the pro-sumti is first used, and __ro__ (all) thereafter.
Reflexive pro-sumti (__vo'a__ , __vo'e__ , __vo'i__ , __vo'o__ , __vo'u__) refer to the same referents as sumti filling other places in the same bridi, with the effect that the same thing is referred to twice:
**Example 6.84. **
le | cribe | cu | batci | vo'a  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | bear |  | bites | what-is-in-the-x1-place.  
The bear bites itself.  
---  
  

Back-counting pro-sumti (__ri__ , __ra__ , __ru__) refer to the referents of previous sumti counted backwards from the pro-sumti:
**Example 6.85. **
mi | klama | la | frankfurt. | ri  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | that-named | Frankfurt | from-the-referent-of-the-last-sumti  
I go from Frankfurt to Frankfurt (by some unstated route).  
---  
  

Indefinite pro-sumti (__zo'e__ , __zu'i__ , __zi'o__) refer to something which is unspecified:
**Example 6.86. **
mi | klama | la | frankfurt.  
---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | that-named | Frankfurt  
zo'e | zo'e | zo'e  
---|---|---  
from-unspecified | via-unspecified | by-means-unspecified.  
  

The implicit quantifier for indefinite pro-sumti is, well, indefinite. It might be __ro__ (all) or __su'o__ (at least one) or conceivably even __no__ (none), though __no__ would require a very odd context indeed.
Demonstrative pro-sumti (__ti__ , __ta__ , __tu__) refer to things pointed at by the speaker, or when pointing is not possible, to things near or far from the speaker:
**Example 6.87. **
ko | muvgau  
---|---  
You [imperative] | move  
ti | ta | tu  
---|---|---  
this-thing | from-that-nearby-place | to-that-further-away-place.  
Move this from there to over there!  
---  
  

Metalinguistic pro-sumti (__di'u__ , __de'u__ , __da'u__ , __di'e__ , __de'e__ , __da'e__ , __dei__ , __do'i__) refer to spoken or written utterances, either preceding, following, or the same as the current utterance.
**Example 6.88. **
li | re | su'i | re | du | li | vo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | two | plus | two | equals | the-number | four.  
.i | la'e | di'u | jetnu  
---|---|---|---  
| The-referent-of | the-previous-utterance | is-true.  
  

The implicit quantifier for metalinguistic pro-sumti is __su'o__ (at least one), because they are considered analogous to __lo__ descriptions: they refer to things which really are previous, current, or following utterances.
The relative pro-sumti (__ke'a__) is used within relative clauses (see Chapter 8 for a discussion of relative clauses) to refer to whatever sumti the relative clause is attached to.
**Example 6.89. **
mi | viska | le | mlatu | ku | poi | zo'e  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | cat(s) |  | such-that | something-unspecified  
zbasu | ke'a | loi | slasi  
---|---|---|---  
makes | it/them-(the-cats) | from-a-mass-of | plastic.  
I see the cat(s) made of plastic.  
---  
  

The question pro-sumti (__ma__) is used to ask questions which request the listener to supply a sumti which will make the question into a truth:
**Example 6.90. **
do | klama | ma  
---|---|---  
You | go-to | what-sumti?  
Where are you going?  
---  
  

The implicit quantifier for the question pro-sumti is __su'o__ (at least one), because the listener is only being asked to supply a single answer, not all correct answers.
In addition, sequences of lerfu words (of selma'o BY and related selma'o) can also be used as definable pro-sumti.
