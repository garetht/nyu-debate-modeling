## 6.14. Quotation summary
There are four kinds of quotation in Lojban: text quotation, words quotation, single-word quotation, non-Lojban quotation. More information is provided in Chapter 19.
Text quotations are preceded by __lu__ and followed by __li'u__ , and are an essential part of the surrounding text: they must be grammatical Lojban texts.
**Example 6.91. **
mi | cusku | lu | mi'e | .djan. | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | say | the-text [quote] | I-am | John | [unquote].  
I say “I'm John”.  
---  
  

Words quotations are quotations of one or more Lojban words. The words need not mean anything, but they must be morphologically valid so that the end of the quotation can be discerned.
**Example 6.92. **
mi | cusku | lo'u | li mi | le'u  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | say | the-words [quote] |  _li mi_ | [unquote].  
I say “ _li mi_ ”.  
---  
  

Note that the translation of Example 6.92 does not translate the Lojban words, because they are not presumed to have any meaning (in fact, they are ungrammatical).
Single-word quotation quotes a single Lojban word. Compound cmavo are not allowed.
**Example 6.93. **
mi | cusku | zo | .ai  
---|---|---|---  
I | say | the-word |  _ _ai._ _  
  

Non-Lojban quotation can quote anything, Lojban or not, even non-speech such as drum talk, whistle words, music, or belching. A Lojban word which does not appear within the quotation is used before and after it to set it off from the surrounding Lojban text.
**Example 6.94. **
mi | cusku | zoi | kuot. | I'm John | .kuot  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | express | [non-Lojban] | < | I'm John | >.  
I say “I'm John”.  
---  
  

The implicit quantifier for all types of quotation is __su'o__ (at least one), because quotations are analogous to __lo__ descriptions: they refer to things which actually are words or sequences of words.
