## 5.2. Simple tanru
Beyond the single brivla, a selbri may consist of two brivla placed together. When a selbri is built in this way from more than one brivla, it is called a tanru, a word with no single English equivalent. The nearest analogue to tanru in English are combinations of two nouns such as “lemon tree”. There is no way to tell just by looking at the phrase “lemon tree” exactly what it refers to, even if you know the meanings of “lemon” and “tree” by themselves. As English-speakers, we must simply know that it refers to “a tree which bears lemons as fruits”. A person who didn't know English very well might think of it as analogous to “brown tree” and wonder, “What kind of tree is lemon-colored?”
In Lojban, tanru are also used for the same purposes as English adjective-noun combinations like “big boy” and adverb-verb combinations like “quickly run”. This is a consequence of Lojban not having any such categories as “noun”, “verb”, “adjective”, or “adverb”. English words belonging to any of these categories are translated by simple brivla in Lojban. Here are some examples of tanru:
**Example 5.6. **
tu | pelnimre | tricu  
---|---|---  
That-yonder | is-a-lemon | tree.  
That is a lemon tree.  
---  
  

**Example 5.7. **
la | djan. | barda | nanla  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | is-a-big | boy.  
John is a big boy.  
---  
  

**Example 5.8. **
mi | sutra | bajra  
---|---|---  
I | quick | run  
I quickly run./I run quickly.  
---  
  

Note that __pelnimre__ is a lujvo for “lemon”; it is derived from the gismu __pelxu__ , yellow, and __nimre__ , citrus. Note also that __sutra__ can mean “fast/quick” or “quickly” depending on its use:
**Example 5.9. **
mi | sutra  
---|---  
I | am-fast/quick  
  

shows __sutra__ used to translate an adjective, whereas in Example 5.8 it is translating an adverb. (Another correct translation of Example 5.8, however, would be “I am a quick runner”.)
There are special Lojban terms for the two components of a tanru, derived from the place structure of the word __tanru__. The first component is called the __seltau__ , and the second component is called the __tertau__.
The most important rule for use in interpreting tanru is that the tertau carries the primary meaning. A _pelnimre tricu_ is primarily a tree, and only secondarily is it connected with lemons in some way. For this reason, an alternative translation of Example 5.6 would be:
**Example 5.10. **
That is a lemon type of tree.
  

This “type of” relationship between the components of a tanru is fundamental to the tanru concept.
We may also say that the seltau modifies the meaning of the tertau:
**Example 5.11. **
That is a tree which is lemon-ish (in the way appropriate to trees)
  

would be another possible translation of Example 5.6. In the same way, a more explicit translation of Example 5.7 might be:
**Example 5.12. **
John is a boy who is big in the way that boys are big.
  

This “way that boys are big” would be quite different from the way in which elephants are big; big-for-a-boy is small-for-an-elephant.
All tanru are ambiguous semantically. Possible translations of:
**Example 5.13. **
ta | klama | jubme  
---|---|---  
That | is-a-goer | type-of-table.  
  

include:
  * That is a table which goes (a wheeled table, perhaps).
  * That is a table owned by one who goes.
  * That is a table used by those who go (a sports doctor's table?).
  * That is a table when it goes (otherwise it is a chair?).


In each case the object referred to is a “goer type of table”, but the ambiguous “type of” relationship can mean one of many things. A speaker who uses tanru (and pragmatically all speakers must) takes the risk of being misunderstood. Using tanru is convenient because they are short and expressive; the circumlocution required to squeeze out all ambiguity can require too much effort.
No general theory covering the meaning of all possible tanru exists; probably no such theory can exist. However, some regularities obviously do exist:
**Example 5.14. **
do | barda | prenu  
---|---|---  
You | are-a-large | person.  
  

**Example 5.15. **
do | cmalu | prenu  
---|---|---  
You | are-a-small | person.  
  

are parallel tanru, in the sense that the relationship between __barda__ and __prenu__ is the same as that between __cmalu__ and __prenu__. Section 5.14 and Section 5.15 contain a partial listing of some types of tanru, with examples.
