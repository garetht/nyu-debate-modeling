## 7.7. Indefinite pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the zo'e-series and the co'e-series
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
zo'e |  KOhA |  zo'e-series |  the obvious value  
---|---|---|---  
zu'i |  KOhA |  zo'e-series |  the typical value  
zi'o |  KOhA |  zo'e-series |  the nonexistent value  
co'e |  GOhA |  co'e-series |  has the obvious relationship  
The cmavo of the zo'e-series represent indefinite, unspecified sumti. The cmavo __zo'e__ represents an elliptical value for this sumti place; it is the optional spoken place holder when a sumti is skipped without being specified. Note that the elliptical value is not always the typical value. The properties of ellipsis lead to an elliptical sumti being defined as “whatever I want it to mean but haven't bothered to figure out, or figure out how to express”.
The cmavo __zu'i__ , on the other hand, represents the typical value for this place of this bridi:
**Example 7.49. **
mi | klama | le | bartu | be | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | outside | of | the | house | from  
le | nenri | be | le | zdani | zu'i | zu'i  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | inside | of | the | house | [by-typical-route] | [by-typical-means]  
  

In Example 7.49, the first __zu'i__ probably means something like “by the door”, and the second __zu'i__ probably means something like “on foot”, those being the typical route and means for leaving a house. On the other hand, if you are at the top of a high rise during a fire, neither __zu'i__ is appropriate. It's also common to use __zu'i__ in “by standard” places.
Finally, the cmavo __zi'o__ represents a value which does not even exist. When a bridi fills one of its places with __zi'o__ , what is really meant is that the selbri has a place which is irrelevant to the true relationship the speaker wishes to express. For example, the place structure of __zbasu__ is:
> actor x1 makes x2 from materials x3
Consider the sentence
> Living things are made from cells.
This cannot be correctly expressed as:
**Example 7.50. **
loi | jmive | cu | se zbasu | [zo'e] | fi | loi | selci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-mass-of | living-things |  | is-made | [by-something] | from | the-mass-of | cells  
  

because the __zo'e__ , expressed or understood, in Example 7.50 indicates that there is still a “maker” in this relationship. We do not generally suppose, however, that someone “makes” living things from cells. The best answer is probably to find a different selbri, one which does not imply a “maker”: however, an alternative strategy is to use __zi'o__ to eliminate the maker place:
**Example 7.51. **
loi | jmive | cu  
---|---|---  
The-mass-of | living-things |   
se zbasu | zi'o |  | loi | selci  
---|---|---|---|---  
is-made | [without-maker] | from | the-mass-of | cells.  
  

Note: The use of __zi'o__ to block up, as it were, one place of a selbri actually creates a new selbri with a different place structure. Consider the following examples:
**Example 7.52. **
mi | zbasu | le | dinju |  | loi | mudri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | make | the | building | from | some-of-the-mass-of | wood.  
I make the building out of wood.  
---  
  

**Example 7.53. **
zi'o | zbasu | le | dinju |  | loi | mudri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[without-maker] | makes | the | building | from | some-of-the-mass-of | wood.  
The building is made out of wood.  
---  
  

**Example 7.54. **
mi | zbasu | zi'o |  | loi | mudri  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | make | [without-thing-made] | from | some-of-the-mass-of | wood.  
I build using wood.  
---  
  

**Example 7.55. **
mi | zbasu | le | dinju | zi'o  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | make | the | building | [without-material].  
I make the building.  
---  
  

If Example 7.52 is true, then Example 7.53 through Example 7.55 must be true also. However, Example 7.51 does not correspond to any sentence with three regular (non- __zi'o__) sumti.
The pro-bridi __co'e__ (which by itself constitutes the co'e-series of selma'o GOhA) represents the elliptical selbri. Lojban grammar does not allow the speaker to merely omit a selbri from a bridi, although any or all sumti may be freely omitted. Being vague about a relationship requires the use of __co'e__ as a selbri place-holder:
**Example 7.56. **
mi | troci | le | nu | mi | co'e | le | vorme  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | try | the | event-of | my | [doing-the-obvious-action] | to-the | door.  
I try the door.  
---  
  

The English version means, and the Lojban version probably means, that I try to open the door, but the relationship of opening is not actually specified; the Lojbanic listener must guess it from context. Lojban, unlike English, makes it clear that there is an implicit action that is not being expressed.
The form of __co'e__ was chosen to resemble __zo'e__ ; the cmavo __do'e__ of selma'o BAI (see Section 9.6) also belongs to the same group of cmavo.
Note that __do'i__ , of the di'u-series, is also a kind of indefinite pro-sumti: it is indefinite in referent, but is restricted to referring only to an utterance.
