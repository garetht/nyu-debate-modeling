## 9.9. Modal selbri
Consider the example:
**Example 9.55. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban  
bai | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
with-compeller | some-act-by | that-named | Frank.  
I speak in Lojban, under compulsion by Frank.  
---  
  

Example 9.55 has two modal sumti, using the modals __bau__ and __bai__. Suppose we wanted to specify the language explicitly but be vague about who's doing the compelling. We can simplify Example 9.55 to:
**Example 9.56. **
mi | tavla | bau | la | lojban. | bai | [ku].  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban | under-compulsion |   
  

In Example 9.56, the elidable terminator __ku__ has taken the place of the sumti which would normally follow __bai__. Alternatively, we could specify the one who compels but keep the language vague:
**Example 9.57. **
mi | tavla | bau | [ku]  
---|---|---|---  
I | speak | in-some-language |   
bai | tu'a | la | frank.  
---|---|---|---  
under-compulsion-by | some-act-by | that-named | Frank.  
  

We are also free to move the modal-plus- __ku__ around the bridi:
**Example 9.58. **
bau | [ku] | bai | ku | mi | tavla  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
In-some-language |  | under-compulsion |  | I | speak.  
  

An alternative to using __ku__ is to place the modal cmavo right before the selbri, following the __cu__ which often appears there. When a modal is present, the __cu__ is almost never necessary.
**Example 9.59. **
mi | bai | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | compelledly | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

In this use, the modal is like a tanru modifier semantically, although grammatically it is quite distinct. Example 9.59 is very similar in meaning to:
**Example 9.60. **
mi | se bapli | tavla | bau | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | compelledly | speak | in-language | that-named | Lojban.  
  

The __se__ conversion is needed because _bapli tavla_ would be a “compeller type of speaker” rather than a “compelled (by someone) type of speaker”, which is what a _bai tavla_ is.
If the modal preceding a selbri is constructed using __fi'o__ , then __fe'u__ is required to prevent the main selbri and the modal selbri from colliding:
**Example 9.61. **
mi | fi'o | kanla | fe'u | viska | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | with | eye |  | see | you.  
I see you with my eye(s).  
---  
  

There are two other uses of modals. A modal can be attached to a pair of bridi-tails that have already been connected by a logical, non-logical, or modal connection (see Chapter 14 for more on logical and non-logical connections):
**Example 9.62. **
mi | bai | ke | ge | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | under-compulsion | ( | both | go | to-the | market  
gi | cadzu | le | bisli | [ke'e]  
---|---|---|---|---  
and | walk | on-the | ice | ).  
Under compulsion, I both go to the market and walk on the ice.  
---  
  

Here the __bai__ is spread over both _klama le zarci_ and _cadzu le bisli_ , and the _ge ... gi_ represents the logical connection “both-and” between the two.
Similarly, a modal can be attached to multiple sentences that have been combined with __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ , which are explained in more detail in Section 19.2:
**Example 9.63. **
bai | tu'e | mi | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Under-compulsion | [start] | I | go | to-the | market.  
.i | mi | cadzu | le | bisli | [tu'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| I | walk | on-the | ice | [end].  
  

means the same thing as Example 9.62.
Note: Either BAI modals or _fi'o-_ plus-selbri modals may correctly be used in any of the constructions discussed in this section.
