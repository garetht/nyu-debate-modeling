## 19.2. Sentences: I
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
.i |  I |  sentence separator  
---|---|---  
Since Lojban is audio-visually isomorphic, there needs to be a spoken and written way of signaling the end of a sentence and the start of the following one. In written English, a period serves this purpose; in spoken English, a tone contour (rising or falling) usually does the job, or sometimes a long pause. Lojban uses a single separator: the cmavo __i__ (of selma'o I):
**Example 19.1. **
mi | klama | le | zarci | .i | do | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | the | store. |  | You | walk-on | the | ice.  
  

The word “separator” should be noted. __i__ is not normally used after the last sentence nor before the first one, although both positions are technically grammatical. __i__ signals a new sentence on the same topic, not necessarily by the same speaker. The relationship between the sentences is left vague, except in stories, where the relationship usually is temporal, and the following sentence states something that happened after the previous sentence.
Note that although the first letter of an English sentence is capitalized, the cmavo __i__ is never capitalized. In writing, it is appropriate to place extra space before __i__ to make it stand out better for the reader. In some styles of Lojban writing, every __i__ is placed at the beginning of a line, possibly leaving space at the end of the previous line.
An __i__ cmavo may or may not be used when the speaker of the following sentence is different from the speaker of the preceding sentence, depending on whether the sentences are felt to be connected or not.
An __i__ cmavo can be compounded with a logical or non-logical connective (a jek or joik), a modal or tense connective, or both: these constructs are explained in Section 9.8, Section 10.16, and Section 14.4. In all cases, the __i__ comes first in the compound. Attitudinals can also be attached to an __i__ if they are meant to apply to the whole sentence: see Section 13.9.
There exist a pair of mechanisms for binding a sequence of sentences closely together. If the __i__ (with or without connectives) is followed by __bo__ (of selma'o BO), then the two sentences being separated are understood to be more closely grouped than sentences connected by __i__ alone.
Similarly, a group of sentences can be preceded by __tu'e__ (of selma'o TUhE) and followed by __tu'u__ (of selma'o TUhU) to fuse them into a single unit. A common use of __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ is to group the sentences which compose a poem: the title sentence would precede the group, separated from it by __i__. Another use might be a set of directions, where each numbered direction might be surrounded by __tu'e__ … __tu'u__ and contain one or more sentences separated by __i__. Grouping with __tu'e__ and __tu'u__ is analogous to grouping with __ke__ and __ke'e__ to establish the scope of logical or non-logical connectives (see Section 14.8).
