## 9.3. Tagging places: FA
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
fa |  FA |  tags x1 place  
---|---|---  
fe |  FA |  tags x2 place  
fi |  FA |  tags x3 place  
fo |  FA |  tags x4 place  
fu |  FA |  tags x5 place  
fi'a |  FA |  place structure question  
In sentences like Example 9.1, it is easy to get lost and forget which sumti falls in which place, especially if the sumti are more complicated than simple names or descriptions. The place structure tags of selma'o FA may be used to help clarify place structures. The five cmavo __fa__ , __fe__ , __fi__ , __fo__ , and __fu__ may be inserted just before the sumti in the x1 to x5 places respectively:
**Example 9.8. **
fa | mi | cu | klama | fe | la | bastn. | fi | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x1= | I |  | go | x2= | that-named | Boston | x3= | that-named | Atlanta  
fo | le | dargu | fu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
x4= | the | road | x5= | the | car.  
I go to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.8, the tag __fu__ before _le karce_ clarifies that _le karce_ occupies the x5 place of __klama__. The use of __fu__ tells us nothing about the purpose or meaning of the x5 place; it simply says that _le karce_ occupies it.
In Example 9.8, the tags are overkill; they serve only to make Example 9.1 even longer than it is. Here is a better illustration of the use of FA tags for clarification:
**Example 9.9. **
fa | mi | klama | fe | le | zdani | be | mi | be'o | poi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x1= | I | go | x2= | (the | house | of | me) |  | which  
nurma | vau | fi | la | nu,IORK.  
---|---|---|---|---  
is-rural |  | x3= | that-named | New-York.  
  

In Example 9.9, the place structure of __klama__ is as follows:
x1 | agent |  _ _mi_ _  
---|---|---  
x2 | destination |  _le zdani be mi be'o poi nurma vau_  
x3 | origin |  _la nu,IORK._  
x4 | route | (empty)  
x5 | means | (empty)  
The __fi__ tag serves to remind the hearer that what follows is in the x3 place of __klama__ ; after listening to the complex sumti occupying the x2 place, it's easy to get lost.
Of course, once the sumti have been tagged, the order in which they are specified no longer carries the burden of distinguishing the places. Therefore, it is perfectly all right to scramble them into any order desired, and to move the selbri to anywhere in the bridi, even the beginning:
**Example 9.10. **
klama | fa | mi | fi | la | .atlantas. | fu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
go | x1= | I | x3= | that-named | Atlanta | x5= | the | car  
fe | la | bastn. | fo | le | dargu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston | x4= | the | road.  
Go I from Atlanta using the car to Boston via the road.  
---  
  

Note that no __cu__ is permitted before the selbri in Example 9.10, because __cu__ separates the selbri from any preceding sumti, and Example 9.10 has no such sumti.
**Example 9.11. **
fu | le | karce | fo | le | dargu | fi | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x5= | the | car | x4= | the | road | x3= | that-named | Atlanta  
fe | la | bastn. | cu | klama | fa | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston |  | go | x1= | I  
Using the car, via the road, from Atlanta to Boston go I.  
---  
  

Example 9.11 exhibits the reverse of the standard bridi form seen in Example 9.1 and Example 9.8, but still means exactly the same thing. If the FA tags were left out, however, producing:
**Example 9.12. **
le | karce | le | dargu | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | car | to-the | road | from-that-named | Atlanta  
la | bastn. | cu | klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
via-that-named | Boston |  | goes | using-me.  
The car goes to the road from Atlanta, with Boston as the route, using me as a means of transport.  
---  
  

the meaning would be wholly changed, and in fact nonsensical.
Tagging places with FA cmavo makes it easy not only to reorder the places but also to omit undesirable ones, without any need for __zo'e__ or special rules about the x1 place:
**Example 9.13. **
klama | fi | la | .atlantas. | fe | la | bastn.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A-goer | x3= | that-named | Atlanta | x2= | that-named | Boston  
fu | le | karce  
---|---|---  
x5= | the | car.  
A goer from Atlanta to Boston using the car.  
---  
  

Here the x1 and x4 places are empty, and so no sumti are tagged with __fa__ or __fo__ ; in addition, the x2 and x3 places appear in reverse order.
What if some sumti have FA tags and others do not? The rule is that after a FA-tagged sumti, any sumti following it occupy the places numerically succeeding it, subject to the proviso that an already-filled place is skipped:
**Example 9.14. **
klama | fa | mi | la | bastn. | la | .atlantas.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Go | x1= | I | x2=that-named | Boston | x3=that-named | Atlanta  
le | dargu | le | karce  
---|---|---|---  
x4=the | road | x5=the | car.  
Go I to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.14, the __fa__ causes __mi__ to occupy the x1 place, and then the following untagged sumti occupy in order the x2 through x5 places. This is the mechanism by which Lojban allows placing the selbri first while specifying a sumti for the x1 place.
Here is a more complex (and more confusing) example:
**Example 9.15. **
mi | klama | fi | la | .atlantas. | le | dargu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go | x3= | that-named | Atlanta, | the | road  
fe | la | bastn. | le | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
x2= | that-named | Boston, | the | car.  
I go from Atlanta via the road to Boston using the car.  
---  
  

In Example 9.15, __mi__ occupies the x1 place because it is the first sumti in the sentence (and is before the selbri). The second sumti, _la .atlantas._ , occupies the x3 place by virtue of the tag __fi__ , and _le dargu_ occupies the x4 place as a result of following _la .atlantas._. Finally, _la bastn._ occupies the x2 place because of its tag __fe__ , and _le karce_ skips over the already-occupied x3 and x4 places to land in the x5 place.
Such a convoluted use of tags should probably be avoided except when trying for a literal translation of some English (or other natural-language) sentence; the rules stated here are merely given so that some standard interpretation is possible.
It is grammatically permitted to tag more than one sumti with the same FA cmavo. The effect is that of making more than one claim:
**Example 9.16. **
[fa] | la | rik. | fa | la | djein. | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[x1=] | that-named | Rick | x1= | that-named | Jane | goes-to  
[fe] | le | skina | fe | le | zdani | fe | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[x2=] | the | movie | x2= | the | house | x2= | the | office  
  

may be taken to say that both Rick and Jane go to the movie, the house, and the office, merging six claims into one. More likely, however, it will simply confuse the listener. There are better ways, involving logical connectives (explained in Chapter 14), to say such things in Lojban. In fact, putting more than one sumti into a place is odd enough that it can only be done by explicit FA usage: this is the motivation for the proviso above, that already-occupied places are skipped. In this way, no sumti can be forced into a place already occupied unless it has an explicit FA cmavo tagging it.
The cmavo __fi'a__ also belongs to selma'o FA, and allows Lojban users to ask questions about place structures. A bridi containing __fi'a__ is a question, asking the listener to supply the appropriate other member of FA which will make the bridi a true statement:
**Example 9.17. **
fi'a | do | dunda | [fe] | le | vi | rozgu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
[what-place]? | you | give | x2= | the | nearby | rose  
In what way are you involved in the giving of this rose?  
---  
Are you the giver or the receiver of this rose?  
  

In Example 9.17, the speaker uses the selbri __dunda__ , whose place structure is:
> _ _dunda_ _ x1 gives x2 to x3
The tagged sumti _fi'a do_ indicates that the speaker wishes to know whether the sumti __do__ falls in the x1 or the x3 place (the x2 place is already occupied by _le rozgu_). The listener can reply with a sentence consisting solely of a FA cmavo: __fa__ if the listener is the giver, __fi__ if he/she is the receiver.
I have inserted the tag __fe__ in brackets into Example 9.17, but it is actually not necessary, because __fi'a__ does not count as a numeric tag; therefore, _le vi rozgu_ would necessarily be in the x2 place even if no tag were present, because it immediately follows the selbri.
There is also another member of FA, namely __fai__ , which is discussed in Section 9.12.
