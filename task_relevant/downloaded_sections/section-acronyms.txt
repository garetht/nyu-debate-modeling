## 17.12. Acronyms
An acronym is a name constructed of lerfu. English examples are “DNA”, “NATO”, “CIA”. In English, some of these are spelled out (like “DNA” and “CIA”) and others are pronounced more or less as if they were ordinary English words (like “NATO”). Some acronyms fluctuate between the two pronunciations: “SQL” may be “ess cue ell” or “sequel”.
In Lojban, a name can be almost any sequence of sounds that ends in a consonant and is followed by a pause. The easiest way to Lojbanize acronym names is to glue the lerfu words together, using _'_ wherever two vowels would come together (pauses are illegal in names) and adding a final consonant:
**Example 17.40. **
la dyny'abub. .i la ny'abuty'obub. .i la cy'ibu'abub.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulyl. .i la .ibubymym. .i la ny'ybucyc.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

There is no fixed convention for assigning the final consonant. In Example 17.40, the last consonant of the lerfu string has been replicated into final position.
Some compression can be done by leaving out __bu__ after vowel lerfu words (except for __.y.bu__ , wherein the __bu__ cannot be omitted without ambiguity). Compression is moderately important because it's hard to say long names without introducing an involuntary (and illegal) pause:
**Example 17.41. **
la dyny'am. .i la ny'aty'om. .i la cy'i'am.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulym. .i la .ibymym. .i la ny'ybucym.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

In Example 17.41, the final consonant _m_ stands for __merko__ , indicating the source culture of these acronyms.
Another approach, which some may find easier to say and which is compatible with older versions of the language that did not have a _'_ character, is to use the consonant _z_ instead of _'_ :
**Example 17.42. **
la dynyzaz. .i la nyzatyzoz. .i la cyzizaz.  
---  
DNA. NATO. CIA.  
---  
… .i la sykybulyz. .i la .ibymyz. .i la nyzybucyz.  
---  
… SQL. IBM. NYC.  
---  
  

One more alternative to these lengthy names is to use the lerfu string itself prefixed with __me__ , the cmavo that makes sumti into selbri:
**Example 17.43. **
la | me | dy | ny. | .abu  
---|---|---|---|---  
that-named | what-pertains-to |  “d” |  “n” |  “a”  
  

This works because __la__ , the cmavo that normally introduces names used as sumti, may also be used before a predicate to indicate that the predicate is a (meaningful) name:
**Example 17.44. **
la | cribe | cu | ciska  
---|---|---|---  
That-named |  “Bear” |  | writes.  
Bear is a writer.  
---  
  

Example 17.44 does not of course refer to a bear (_le cribe_ or _lo cribe_) but to something else, probably a person, named “Bear”. Similarly, _me dy ny. .abu_ is a predicate which can be used as a name, producing a kind of acronym which can have pauses between the individual lerfu words.
