## 18.8. Indefinite numbers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ro |  PA |  all  
---|---|---  
so'a |  PA |  almost all  
so'e |  PA |  most  
so'i |  PA |  many  
so'o |  PA |  several  
so'u |  PA |  a few  
no'o |  PA |  the typical number of  
da'a |  PA |  all but (one) of  
piro |  PA+PA |  the whole of/all of  
piso'a |  PA+PA |  almost the whole of  
piso'e |  PA+PA |  most of  
piso'i |  PA+PA |  much of  
piso'o |  PA+PA |  a small part of  
piso'u |  PA+PA |  a tiny part of  
pino'o |  PA+PA |  the typical portion of  
rau |  PA |  enough  
du'e |  PA |  too many  
mo'a |  PA |  too few  
pirau |  PA+PA |  enough of  
pidu'e |  PA+PA |  too much of  
pimo'a |  PA+PA |  too little of  
Not all the cmavo of PA represent numbers in the usual mathematical sense. For example, the cmavo __ro__ means “all” or “each”. This number does not have a definite value in the abstract: _li ro_ is undefined. But when used to count or quantify something, the parallel between __ro__ and __pa__ is clearer:
**Example 18.41. **
mi | catlu | pa | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | one | person  
  

**Example 18.42. **
mi | catlu | ro | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all | persons  
  

Example 18.41 might be true, whereas Example 18.42 is almost certainly false.
The cmavo __so'a__ , __so'e__ , __so'i__ , __so'o__ , and __so'u__ represent a set of indefinite numbers less than __ro__. As you go down an alphabetical list, the magnitude decreases:
**Example 18.43. **
mi | catlu | so'a | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | almost-all | persons  
  

**Example 18.44. **
mi | catlu | so'e | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | most | persons  
  

**Example 18.45. **
mi | catlu | so'i | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | many | persons  
  

**Example 18.46. **
mi | catlu | so'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | several | persons  
  

**Example 18.47. **
mi | catlu | so'u | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | a-few | persons  
  

The English equivalents are only rough: the cmavo provide space for up to five indefinite numbers between __ro__ and __no__ , with a built-in ordering. In particular, __so'e__ does not mean “most” in the sense of “a majority” or “more than half”.
Each of these numbers, plus __ro__ , may be prefixed with __pi__ (the decimal point) in order to make a fractional form which represents part of a whole rather than some elements of a totality. __piro__ therefore means “the whole of”:
**Example 18.48. **
mi | citka | piro | lei | nanba  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | eat | the-whole-of | the-mass-of | bread  
  

Similarly, __piso'a__ means “almost the whole of”; and so on down to __piso'u__ , “a tiny part of”. These numbers are particularly appropriate with masses, which are usually measured rather than counted, as Example 18.48 shows.
In addition to these cmavo, there is __no'o__ , meaning “the typical value”, and _pino'o_ , meaning “the typical portion”: Sometimes __no'o__ can be translated “the average value”, but the average in question is not, in general, a mathematical mean, median, or mode; these would be more appropriately represented by operators.
**Example 18.49. **
mi | catlu | no'o | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | a-typical-number-of | persons  
  

**Example 18.50. **
mi | citka | pino'o | lei | nanba  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | eat | a-typical-amount-of | the-mass-of | bread.  
  

__da'a__ is a related cmavo meaning “all but”:
**Example 18.51. **
mi | catlu | da'a | re | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all-but | two | persons  
  

**Example 18.52. **
mi | catlu | da'a | so'u | prenu  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | look-at | all-but | a-few | persons  
  

Example 18.52 is similar in meaning to Example 18.43.
If no number follows __da'a__ , then __pa__ is assumed; __da'a__ by itself means “all but one”, or in ordinal contexts “all but the last”:
**Example 18.53. **
ro | ratcu | ka'e | citka | da'a | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
All | rats | can | eat | all-but-one | rats.  
All rats can eat all other rats.  
---  
  

(The use of __da'a__ means that Example 18.53 does not require that all rats can eat themselves, but does allow it. Each rat has one rat it cannot eat, but that one might be some rat other than itself. Context often dictates that “itself” is, indeed, the “other” rat.)
As mentioned in Section 18.3, __ma'u__ and __ni'u__ are also legal numbers, and they mean “some positive number” and “some negative number” respectively.
**Example 18.54. **
li | ci | vu'u | re | du | li | ma'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 3 | − | 2 | = |  | some-positive-number  
  

**Example 18.55. **
li | ci | vu'u | vo | du | li | ni'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 3 | − | 4 | = |  | some-negative-number  
  

**Example 18.56. **
mi | ponse | ma'u | rupnu  
---|---|---|---  
I | possess | a-positive-number-of | currency-units.  
  

All of the numbers discussed so far are objective, even if indefinite. If there are exactly six superpowers (_rairgugde_ , “superlative-states”) in the world, then _ro rairgugde_ means the same as _xa rairgugde_. It is often useful, however, to express subjective indefinite values. The cmavo __rau__ (enough), __du'e__ (too many), and __mo'a__ (too few) are then appropriate:
**Example 18.57. **
mi | ponse | rau | rupnu  
---|---|---|---  
I | possess | enough | currency-units.  
  

Like the __so'a__ -series, __rau__ , __du'e__ , and __mo'a__ can be preceded by __pi__ ; for example, _pirau_ means “a sufficient part of.”
Another possibility is that of combining definite and indefinite numbers into a single number. This usage implies that the two kinds of numbers have the same value in the given context:
**Example 18.58. **
mi | viska | le | rore | gerku  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | all-of/two | dogs.  
I saw both dogs.  
---  
  

**Example 18.59. **
mi | speni | so'ici | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
I | am-married-to | many/three | persons.  
I am married to three persons (which is “many” in the circumstances).  
---  
  

Example 18.59 assumes a mostly monogamous culture by stating that three is “many”.
