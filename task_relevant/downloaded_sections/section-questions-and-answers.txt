## 19.5. Questions and answers
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
xu |  UI |  truth question  
---|---|---  
ma |  KOhA |  sumti question  
mo |  GOhA |  bridi question  
xo |  PA |  number question  
ji |  A |  sumti connective question  
ge'i |  GA |  forethought connective question  
gi'i |  GIhA |  bridi-tail connective question  
gu'i |  GUhA |  tanru forethought connective question  
je'i |  JA |  tanru connective question  
pei |  UI |  attitude question  
fi'a |  FA |  place structure question  
cu'e |  CUhE |  tense/modal question  
pau |  UI |  question premarker  
Lojban questions are not at all like English questions. There are two basic types: truth questions, of the form “Is it true that ...”, and fill-in-the-blank questions. Truth questions are marked by preceding the bridi, or following any part of it specifically questioned, with the cmavo __xu__ (of selma'o UI):
**Example 19.13. **
xu | do | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
[True-or-false?] | You | go-to | the | store  
Are you going to the store/Did you go to the store?  
---  
  

(Since the Lojban is tenseless, either colloquial translation might be correct.) Truth questions are further discussed in Section 15.8.
Fill-in-the-blank questions have a cmavo representing some Lojban word or phrase which is not known to the questioner, and which the answerer is to supply. There are a variety of cmavo belonging to different selma'o which provide different kinds of blanks.
Where a sumti is not known, a question may be formed with __ma__ (of selma'o KOhA), which is a kind of pro-sumti:
**Example 19.14. **
ma | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---  
[What-sumti?] | goes-to | the | store  
Who is going to the store?  
---  
  

Of course, the __ma__ need not be in the x1 place:
**Example 19.15. **
do | klama | ma  
---|---|---  
You | go-to | [what-sumti?]  
Where are you going?  
---  
  

The answer is a simple sumti:
**Example 19.16. **
le zarci  
---  
The store.  
---  
  

A sumti, then, is a legal utterance, although it does not by itself constitute a bridi – it does not claim anything, but merely completes the open-ended claim of the previous bridi.
There can be two __ma__ cmavo in a single question:
**Example 19.17. **
ma klama ma  
---  
Who goes where?  
---  
  

and the answer would be two sumti, which are meant to fill in the two __ma__ cmavo in order:
**Example 19.18. **
mi | le | zarci  
---|---|---  
I, | [to]-the | store.  
  

An even more complex example, depending on the non-logical connective __fa'u__ (of selma'o JOI), which is like the English “and ... respectively”:
**Example 19.19. **
ma | fa'u | ma | klama | ma | fa'u | ma  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Who and who goes where and where, -respectively?  
---  
  

An answer might be
**Example 19.20. **
la | djan. | la | marcas. | le | zarci | le | briju  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| John, |  | Marsha, | the | store, | the | office.  
John and Marsha go to the store and the office, respectively.  
---  
  

(Note: A mechanical substitution of Example 19.20 into Example 19.19 produces an ungrammatical result, because _* ... le zarci fa'u le briju_ is ungrammatical Lojban: the first _le zarci_ has to be closed with its proper terminator __ku__ , for reasons explained in Section 14.14. This effect is not important: Lojban behaves as if all elided terminators have been supplied in both question and answer before inserting the latter into the former. The exchange is grammatical if question and answer are each separately grammatical.)
Questions to be answered with a selbri are expressed with __mo__ of selma'o GOhA, which is a kind of pro-bridi:
**Example 19.21. **
la | lojban. | mo  
---|---|---  
| Lojban | [what-selbri?]  
What is Lojban?  
---  
  

Here the answerer is to supply some predicate which is true of Lojban. Such questions are extremely open-ended, due to the enormous range of possible predicate answers. The answer might be just a selbri, or might be a full bridi, in which case the sumti in the answer override those provided by the questioner. To limit the range of a __mo__ question, make it part of a tanru.
Questions about numbers are expressed with __xo__ of selma'o PA:
**Example 19.22. **
do | viska | xo | prenu  
---|---|---|---  
You | saw | [what-number?] | persons.  
How many people did you see?  
---  
  

The answer would be a simple number, another kind of non-bridi utterance:
**Example 19.23. **
vomu  
---  
Forty-five.  
  

Fill-in-the-blank questions may also be asked about: logical connectives (using cmavo __ji__ of A, __ge'i__ of GA, __gi'i__ of GIhA, __gu'i__ of GUhA, or __je'i__ of JA, and receiving an ek, gihek, ijek, or ijoik as an answer) – see Section 14.13; attitudes (using __pei__ of UI, and receiving an attitudinal as an answer) – see Section 13.10; place structures (using __fi'a__ of FA, and receiving a cmavo of FA as an answer) – see Section 9.3; tenses and modals (using __cu'e__ of CUhE, and receiving any tense or BAI cmavo as an answer) – see Section 9.6 and Chapter 10.
Questions can be marked by placing __pau__ (of selma'o UI) before the question bridi. See Section 13.13 for details.
The full list of non-bridi utterances suitable as answers to questions is:
  * any number of sumti (with elidable terminator __vau__ , see Chapter 6)
  * an ek or gihek (logical connectives, see Chapter 14)
  * a number, or any mathematical expression placed in parentheses (see Chapter 18)
  * a bare __na__ negator (to negate some previously expressed bridi), or corresponding __ja'a__ affirmer (see Chapter 15)
  * a relative clause (to modify some previously expressed sumti, see Chapter 8)
  * a prenex/topic (to modify some previously expressed bridi, see Chapter 16)
  * linked arguments (beginning with __be__ or __bei__ and attached to some previously expressed selbri, often in a description, see Section 5.7)


At the beginning of a text, the following non-bridi are also permitted:
  * one or more names (to indicate direct address without __doi__ , see Chapter 6)
  * indicators (to express a prevailing attitude, see Chapter 13)
  * __nai__ (to vaguely negate something or other, see Section 15.7)


Where not needed for the expression of answers, most of these are made grammatical for pragmatic reasons: people will say them in conversation, and there is no reason to rule them out as ungrammatical merely because most of them are vague.
