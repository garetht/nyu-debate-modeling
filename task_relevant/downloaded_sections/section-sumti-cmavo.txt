## 2.3. Words that can act as sumti
Here is a short table of single words used as sumti. This table provides examples only, not the entire set of such words, which may be found in Section 7.16.
mi |  I/me, we/us  
---|---  
do |  you  
ti |  this, these  
ta |  that, those  
tu |  that far away, those far away  
zo'e |  unspecified value (used when a sumti is unimportant or obvious)  
Lojban sumti are not specific as to number (singular or plural), nor gender (masculine/feminine/neutral). Such distinctions can be optionally added by methods that are beyond the scope of this chapter.
The cmavo __ti__ , __ta__ , and __tu__ refer to whatever the speaker is pointing at, and should not be used to refer to things that cannot in principle be pointed at.
Names may also be used as sumti, provided they are preceded with the word __la__ :
_la meris._ | the one/ones named Mary  
---|---  
_la djan._ | the one/ones named John  
Other Lojban spelling versions are possible for names from other languages, and there are restrictions on which letters may appear in Lojban names: see Section 6.12 for more information.
