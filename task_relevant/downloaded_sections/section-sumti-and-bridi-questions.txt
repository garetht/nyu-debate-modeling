## 7.9. sumti and bridi questions: _ma_ and _mo_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ma |  KOhA |  sumti question  
---|---|---  
mo |  GOhA |  bridi question  
Lojban questions are more fully explained in Section 19.5, but __ma__ and __mo__ are listed in this chapter for completeness. The cmavo __ma__ asks for a sumti to make the bridi true:
**Example 7.63. **
do | klama | ma  
---|---|---  
You | go-to | what?  
Where are you going?  
---  
  

The cmavo __mo__ , on the other hand, asks for a selbri which makes the question bridi true. If the answer is a full bridi, then the arguments of the answer override the arguments in the question, in the same manner as the go'i-series cmavo. A simple example is:
**Example 7.64. **
do mo  
---  
What predicate is true as applied to you?  
---  
How are you?  
What are you doing?  
What are you?  
  

Example 7.65 is a truly pregnant question that will have several meanings depending on context.
(One thing it probably does not mean is “Who are you?” in the sense “What is your name/identity?”, which is better expressed by:
**Example 7.65. **
ma | cmene | do  
---|---|---  
What-sumti | is-the-name-of | you?  
What is your name?  
---  
  

or even
**Example 7.66. **
doi | ma  
---|---  
O | [what sumti?]  
  

which uses the vocative __doi__ to address someone, and simultaneously asks who the someone is.)
A further example of __mo__ :
**Example 7.67. **
lo | mo |  | prenu | cu | darxi | do | .i | barda  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A | [what selbri?] | type-of | person |  | hit | you? |  | A big thing.  
Which person hit you? The big one.  
---  
  

When __ma__ or __mo__ is repeated, multiple questions are being asked simultaneously:
**Example 7.68. **
ma | djuno | ma  
---|---|---  
[What-sumti] | knows | [what-sumti]?  
Who knows what?  
---
