## 7.11. Abstraction focus pro-sumti: _ce'u_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ce'u |  KOhA |  abstraction focus  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __ce'u__ is used within abstraction bridi, particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo __ka__. Abstractions, including the uses of __ce'u__ , are discussed in full in Chapter 11.
In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using __ce'u__. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly between:
**Example 7.71. **
le | ka | ce'u | gleki  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (X | being-happy)  
the property of being happy  
---  
happiness  
  

and
**Example 7.72. **
le | ka | gleki | ce'u  
---|---|---|---  
the | property-of | (being-happy-about | X)  
the property of being that which someone is happy about
