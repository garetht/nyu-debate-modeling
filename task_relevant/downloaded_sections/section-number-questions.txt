## 18.12. Number questions
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
xo |  PA |  number question  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __xo__ , a member of selma'o PA, is used to ask questions whose answers are numbers. Like most Lojban question words, it fills the blank where the answer should go. (See Section 19.5 for more on Lojban questions.)
**Example 18.95. **
li | re | su'i | re | du | li | xo  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | 2 | plus | 2 | equals | the-number | what?  
What is 2 + 2?  
---  
  

**Example 18.96. **
le | xomoi | prenu | cu | darxi | do  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | what-number-th | person |  | hit | you?  
Which person [as in a police lineup] hit you?  
---  
  

__xo__ can also be combined with other digits to ask questions whose answers are already partly specified. This ability could be very useful in writing tests of elementary arithmetical knowledge:
**Example 18.97. **
li | remu | pi'i | xa | du | li | paxono  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | 25 | times | 6 | equals | the-number | 1?0  
  

to which the correct reply would be __mu__ , or 5. The ability to utter bare numbers as grammatical Lojban sentences is primarily intended for giving answers to __xo__ questions. (Another use, obviously, is for counting off physical objects one by one.)
