## 9.15. Logical and non-logical connection of modals
Logical and non-logical connectives are explained in detail in Chapter 14. For the purposes of this chapter, it suffices to point out that a logical (or non-logical) connection between two bridi which differ only in a modal can be reduced to a single bridi with a connective between the modals. As a result, Example 9.91 and Example 9.92 mean the same thing:
**Example 9.91. **
la | frank. | bajra | seka'a | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | runs | with-destination | the | house.  
.ije | la | frank. | bajra | teka'a | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
And | that-named | Frank | runs | with-origin | the | house.  
Frank runs to the house, and Frank runs from the house.  
---  
  

**Example 9.92. **
la | frank. | bajra | seka'a  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | runs | with-destination  
je | teka'a | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
and | with-origin | the | house.  
Frank runs to and from the house.  
---  
  

Neither example implies whether a single act, or two acts, of running is referred to. To compel the sentence to refer to a single act of running, you can use the form:
**Example 9.93. **
la | frank. | bajra | seka'a | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Frank | runs | with-destination | the | house  
ce'e | teka'a | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---  
[joined-to] | with-origin | the | house.  
  

The cmavo __ce'e__ creates a termset containing two terms (termsets are explained in Chapter 14 and Chapter 16). When a termset contains more than one modal tag derived from a single BAI, the convention is that the two tags are derived from a common event.
