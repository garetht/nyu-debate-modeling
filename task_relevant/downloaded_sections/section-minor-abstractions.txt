## 11.9. Minor abstraction types
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
li'i |  NU |  experience abstractor  
---|---|---  
si'o |  NU |  concept abstractor  
su'u |  NU |  general abstractor  
There are three more abstractors in Lojban, all of them little used so far. The abstractor __li'i__ expresses experience:
**Example 11.58. **
mi | morji | le | li'i | mi | verba  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | remember | the | experience-of | (my | being-a-child)  
  

The abstractor __si'o__ expresses a mental image, a concept, an idea:
**Example 11.59. **
mi | nelci | le | si'o | la | lojban. | cu | mulno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | enjoy | the | concept-of | that-named | Lojban |  | being-complete.  
  

Finally, the abstractor __su'u__ is a vague abstractor, whose meaning must be grasped from context:
**Example 11.60. **
ko | zgana | le | su'u | le | ci | smacu | cu | bajra  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
you [imperative] | observe | the | abstract-nature-of | the | three | mice |  | running  
See how the three mice run!  
---  
  

All three of these abstractors have an x2 place. An experience requires an experiencer, so the place structure of __li'i__ is:
> _ _li'i_ _ x1 is the experience of (the bridi) as experienced by x2
Similarly, an idea requires a mind to hold it, so the place structure of __si'o__ is:
> _ _si'o_ _ x1 is the idea/concept of (the bridi) in the mind of x2
Finally, there needs to be some way of specifying just what sort of abstraction __su'u__ is representing, so its place structure is:
> _ _su'u_ _ x1 is an abstract nature of (the bridi) of type x2
The x2 place of __su'u__ allows it to serve as a substitute for any of the other abstractors, or as a template for creating new ones. For example,
**Example 11.61. **
le | nu | mi | klama  
---|---|---|---  
the | event-of | my | going  
  

can be paraphrased as
**Example 11.62. **
le | su'u | mi | klama | kei | be | lo | fasnu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the | abstract-nature-of | (my | going) |  | of-type | an | event  
  

and there is a book whose title might be rendered in Lojban as:
**Example 11.63. **
le | su'u | la | .iecuas.  
---|---|---|---  
the | abstract-nature-of | (that-named | Jesus  
kuctai | selcatra | kei  
---|---|---  
is-an-intersect-shape | type-of-killed-one | )  
be | lo | sa'ordzifa'a  
---|---|---  
of-type | a | slope-low-direction  
ke | nalmatma'e | sutyterjvi  
---|---|---  
type-of | non-motor-vehicle | speed-competition  
The Crucifixion of Jesus Considered As A Downhill Bicycle Race  
---  
  

Note the importance of using __kei__ after __su'u__ when the x2 of __su'u__ (or any other abstractor) is being specified; otherwise, the _be lo_ ends up inside the abstraction bridi.
