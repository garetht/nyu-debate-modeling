## 19.11. Contrastive emphasis: BAhE
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
ba'e |  BAhE |  emphasize next word  
---|---|---  
za'e |  BAhE |  next word is nonce  
English often uses strong stress on a word to single it out for contrastive emphasis, thus
**Example 19.58. **
I saw George.
  

is quite different from
**Example 19.59. **
I saw _George_.
  

The heavy stress on “ _George_ ” (represented in writing by _italics_) indicates that I saw George rather than someone else. Lojban does not use stress in this way: stress is used only to help separate words (because every brivla is stressed on the penultimate syllable) and in names to match other languages' stress patterns. Note that many other languages do not use stress in this way either; typically word order is rearranged, producing something like
**Example 19.60. **
It was George whom I saw.
  

In Lojban, the cmavo __ba'e__ (of selma'o BAhE) precedes a single word which is to be emphasized:
**Example 19.61. **
mi | viska | la | ba'e | .djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the-one-named | [emphasis] |  “George” | .  
I saw _George_.  
---  
  

Note the pause before the name _djordj._ , which serves to separate it unambiguously from the __ba'e__. Alternatively, the __ba'e__ can be moved to a position before the __la__ , which in effect emphasizes the whole construct _la djordj._ :
**Example 19.62. **
mi | viska | ba'e | la | djordj.  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | [emphasis] | the-one-named |  “George” | .  
I saw _George_.  
---  
  

Marking a word with a cmavo of BAhE does not change the word's grammar in any way. Any word in a bridi can receive contrastive emphasis marking:
**Example 19.63. **
ba'e mi viska la djordj.  
---  
I, no one else, saw George.  
---  
  

**Example 19.64. **
mi ba'e viska la djordj.  
---  
I saw (not heard or smelled) George.  
---  
  

Emphasis on one of the structural components of a Lojban bridi can also be achieved by rearranging it into an order that is not the speaker's or writer's usual order. Any sumti moved out of place, or the selbri when moved out of place, is emphatic to some degree.
For completeness, the cmavo __za'e__ should be mentioned, also of selma'o BAhE. It marks a word as possibly irregular, non-standard, or nonce (created for the occasion):
**Example 19.65. **
mi | klama | la | za'e | .albeinias.  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to |  | so-called | Albania  
  

marks a Lojbanization of an English name, where a more appropriate standard form might be something like _la ckiipyris._ , reflecting the country's name in Albanian.
Before a lujvo or fu'ivla, __za'e__ indicates that the word has been made up on the spot and may be used in a sense that is not found in the unabridged dictionary (when we have an unabridged dictionary!).
