## 13.12. Discursives
The term “discursive” is used for those members of selma'o UI that provide structure to the discourse, and which show how a given word or utterance relates to the whole discourse. To express these concepts in regular bridi would involve extra layers of nesting: rather than asserting that “I also came”, we would have to say “I came; furthermore, the event of my coming is an additional instance of the relationship expressed by the previous sentence”, which is intolerably clumsy. Typical English equivalents of discursives are words or phrases like “however”, “summarizing”, “in conclusion”, and “for example”.
Discursives are not attitudinals: they express no particular emotion. Rather, they are abbreviations for metalinguistic claims that reference the sentence or text they are found in.
Discursives are most often used at the beginning of sentences, often attached to the __i__ that separates sentences in running discourse, but can (like all other indicators) be attached to single words when it seems necessary or useful.
The discursives discussed in this section are given in groups, roughly organized by function. First, the “consecutive discourse” group:
ku'i |  [karbi] |  however/but/in contrast  
---|---|---  
ji'a |  [jmina] |  additionally  
si'a |  [simsa] |  similarly  
mi'u |  [mintu] |  ditto  
po'o |  |  the only relevant case  
These five discursives are mutually exclusive, and therefore they are not usually considered as scales. The first four are used in consecutive discourse. The first, __ku'i__ , makes an exception to the previous argument. The second, __ji'a__ , adds weight to the previous argument. The third, __si'a__ , adds quantity to the previous argument, enumerating an additional example. The fourth, __mi'u__ , adds a parallel case to the previous argument, and can also be used in tables or the like to show that something is being repeated from the previous column. It is distinct from __go'i__ (of selma'o GOhA, discussed in Section 7.6), which is a non-discursive version of “ditto” that explicitly repeats the claim of the previous bridi.
Lastly, __po'o__ is used when there is no other comparable case, and thus corresponds to some of the uses of “only”, a word difficult to express in pure bridi form:
**Example 13.83. **
mi | po'o | darxi | le | mi | tamne | fo | le | nazbi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [only] | hit | the | of-me | cousin | at-locus | the | nose.  
Only I (nobody else) hit my cousin on his nose.  
---  
  

**Example 13.84. **
mi | darxi | po'o | le | mi | tamne | fo | le | nazbi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | hit | [only] | the | of-me | cousin | at-locus | the | nose.  
I only hit my cousin on his nose (I did nothing else to him).  
---  
  

**Example 13.85. **
mi | darxi | le | mi | tamne | po'o | fo | le | nazbi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | hit | the | of-me | cousin | [only] | at-locus | the | nose.  
I hit only my cousin on his nose (no one else).  
---  
  

**Example 13.86. **
mi | darxi | le | mi | tamne | fo | le | nazbi | po'o  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | hit | the | of-me | cousin | at-locus | the | nose | [only].  
I hit my cousin only on his nose (nowhere else).  
---  
  

Note that “only” can go before or after what it modifies in English, but __po'o__ , as an indicator, always comes afterward.
Next, the “commentary on words” group:
va'i |  [valsi] |  in other words |  in the same words  
---|---|---|---  
ta'u |  [tanru] |  expanding a tanru |  making a tanru  
The discursives __va'i__ and __ta'u__ operate at the level of words, rather than discourse proper, or if you like, they deal with how things are said. An alternative English expression for __va'i__ is “rephrasing”; for __va'inai__ , “repeating”. Also compare __va'i__ with __ke'u__ , discussed below.
The cmavo __ta'u__ is a discursive unique to Lojban; it expresses the particularly Lojbanic device of tanru. Since tanru are semantically ambiguous, they are subject to misunderstanding. This ambiguity can be removed by expanding the tanru into some semantically unambiguous structure, often involving relative clauses or the introduction of additional brivla. The discursive __ta'u__ marks the transition from the use of a brief but possibly confusing tanru to its fuller, clearer expansion; the discursive __ta'unai__ marks a transition in the reverse direction.
Next, the “commentary on discourse” group:
li'a |  [klina] |  clearly; obviously |  |  obscurely  
---|---|---|---|---  
ba'u |  [banli] |  exaggeration |  accuracy |  understatement  
zo'o |  |  humorously |  dully |  seriously  
sa'e |  [satci] |  precisely speaking |  |  loosely speaking  
to'u |  [tordu] |  in brief |  |  in detail  
do'a |  [dunda] |  generously |  |  parsimoniously  
sa'u |  [sampu] |  simply |  |  elaborating  
pa'e |  [pajni] |  justice |  |  prejudice  
je'u |  [jetnu] |  truly |  |  falsely  
This group is used by the speaker to characterize the nature of the discourse, so as to prevent misunderstanding. It is well-known that listeners often fail to recognize a humorous statement and take it seriously, or miss an exaggeration, or try to read more into a statement than the speaker intends to put there. In speech, the tone of voice often provides the necessary cue, but the reader of ironic or understated or imprecise discourse is often simply clueless. As with the attitudinals, the use of these cmavo may seem fussy to new Lojbanists, but it is important to remember that __zo'o__ , for example, is the equivalent of smiling while you speak, not the equivalent of a flat declaration like “What I'm about to say is supposed to be funny.”
A few additional English equivalents: for __sa'enai__ , “roughly speaking” or “approximately speaking”; for __sa'unai__ , “furthermore”; for __to'u__ , “in short” or “skipping details”; for __do'a__ , “broadly construed”; for __do'anai__ (as you might expect), “narrowly construed”.
The cmavo __pa'e__ is used to claim (truly or falsely) that one is being fair or just to all parties mentioned, whereas __pa'enai__ admits (or proclaims) a bias in favor of one party.
The scale of __je'u__ and __je'unai__ is a little different from the others in the group. By default, we assume that people speak the truth – or at least, that if they are lying, they will do their best to conceal it from us. So under what circumstances would __je'unai__ be used, or __je'u__ be useful? For one thing, __je'u__ can be used to mark a tautology: a sentence that is a truth of logic, like “All cats are cats.” Its counterpart __je'unai__ then serves to mark a logical contradiction. In addition, __je'unai__ can be used to express one kind of sarcasm or irony, where the speaker pretends to believe what he/she says, but actually wishes the listener to infer a contrary opinion. Other forms of irony can be marked with __zo'o__ (humor) or __.ianai__ (disbelief).
When used as a discursive, __su'a__ (see Section 13.11) belongs to this group.
Next, the “knowledge” group:
ju'o |  [djuno] |  certainly |  uncertain |  certainly not  
---|---|---|---|---  
la'a |  [lakne] |  probably |  |  improbably  
These two discursives describe the speaker's state of knowledge about the claim of the associated bridi. They are similar to the propositional attitudes of Section 13.3, as they create a hypothetical world. We may be quite certain that something is true, and label our bridi with __ju'o__ ; but it may be false all the same.
Next, the “discourse management” group:
ta'o |  [tanjo] |  by the way |  |  returning to point  
---|---|---|---|---  
ra'u |  [ralju] |  chiefly |  equally |  incidentally  
mu'a |  [mupli] |  for example |  omitting examples |  end examples  
zu'u |  |  on the one hand |  |  on the other hand  
ke'u |  [krefu] |  repeating |  |  continuing  
da'i |  |  supposing |  |  in fact  
This final group is used to perform what may be called “managing the discourse”: providing reference points to help the listener understand the flow from one sentence to the next.
Other English equivalents of __ta'onai__ are “anyway”, “anyhow”, “in any case”, “in any event”, “as I was saying”, and “continuing”.
The scale of __ra'u__ has to do with the importance of the point being, or about to be, expressed: __ra'u__ is the most important point, __ra'ucu'i__ is a point of equal importance, and __ra'unai__ is a lesser point. Other English equivalents of __ra'u__ are “above all” and “primarily”.
The cmavo __ke'u__ is very similar to __va'i__ , although __ke'unai__ and __va'inai__ are quite different. Both __ke'u__ and __va'i__ indicate that the same idea is going to be expressed using different words, but the two cmavo differ in emphasis. Using __ke'u__ emphasizes that the content is the same; using __va'i__ emphasizes that the words are different. Therefore, __ke'unai__ shows that the content is new (and therefore the words are also); __va'inai__ shows that the words are the same (and therefore so is the content). One English equivalent of __ke'unai__ is “furthermore”.
The discursive __da'i__ marks the discourse as possibly taking a non-real-world viewpoint (“Supposing that”, “By hypothesis”), whereas __da'inai__ insists on the real-world point of view (“In fact”, “In truth”, “According to the facts”). A common use of __da'i__ is to distinguish between:
**Example 13.87. **
ganai | da'i | do | viska | le | mi | citno | mensi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
If | [hypothetical] | you | see | the | of-me | young | sister,  
gi | ju'o | do | djuno | le | du'u | ri | pazvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [certain] | you | know | the | predication-of | she | is-pregnant.  
If you were to see my younger sister, you would certainly know she is pregnant.  
---  
  

and:
**Example 13.88. **
ganai | da'inai | do | viska | le | mi | citno | mensi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
If | [factual] | you | see | the | of-me | young | sister,  
gi | ju'o | do | djuno | le | du'u | ri | pazvau  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
then | [certainty] | you | know | the | predication-of | she | is-pregnant.  
If you saw my younger sister, you would certainly know she is pregnant.  
---  
  

It is also perfectly correct to omit the discursive altogether, and leave the context to indicate which significance is meant. (Chinese always leaves this distinction to the context: the Chinese sentence
**Example 13.89. **
  * _ru 2guo3 ni3 kan4dao4 wo3 mei4mei, ni3 yi2ding4 zhi1dao4 ta1 huai2yun4 le_
  * if you see-arrive my younger-sister, you certainly know she pregnant


  

is the equivalent of either Example 13.87 or Example 13.88.)
