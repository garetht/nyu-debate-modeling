## 8.4. Multiple relative clauses: _zi'e_
zi'e |  ZIhE |  relative clause joiner  
---|---|---  
Sometimes it is necessary or useful to attach more than one relative clause to a sumti. This is made possible in Lojban by the cmavo __zi'e__ (of selma'o ZIhE), which is used to join one or more relative clauses together into a single unit, thus making them apply to the same sumti. For example:
**Example 8.38. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | zi'e | poi | batci | le | nanmu | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The dog which is white and which bites the man goes.  
---  
  

The most usual translation of __zi'e__ in English is “and”, but __zi'e__ is not really a logical connective: unlike most of the true logical connectives (which are explained in Chapter 14), it cannot be converted into a logical connection between sentences.
It is perfectly correct to use __zi'e__ to connect relative clauses of different kinds:
**Example 8.39. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | zi'e | noi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | that-is | (white) | and | incidentally-such-that  
le | mi | pendo | cu | ponse | ke'a | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(- | my | friend |  | owns | IT | ) | goes.  
The dog that is white, which my friend owns, is going.  
---  
  

In Example 8.39, the restrictive clause _poi blabi_ specifies which dog is referred to, but the incidental clause _noi le mi pendo cu ponse_ is mere incidental information: the listener is supposed to already have identified the dog from the _poi blabi_. Of course, the meaning (though not necessarily the emphasis) is the same if the incidental clause appears first.
It is also possible to connect relative phrases with __zi'e__ , or a relative phrase with a relative clause:
**Example 8.40. **
le | botpi | po | mi | zi'e | poi | blanu | cu | spofu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | bottle | specific-to | me | and | which-is | blue |  | is-broken.  
My blue bottle is broken.  
---  
  

Note that if the colloquial translation of Example 8.40 were “My bottle, which is blue, is broken”, then __noi__ rather than __poi__ would have been correct in the Lojban version, since that version of the English implies that you do not need to know the bottle is blue. As written, Example 8.40 suggests that I probably have more than one bottle, and the one in question needs to be picked out as the blue one.
**Example 8.41. **
mi | ba | zutse | le | stizu | pe  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | sit-in | the | chair | associated-with  
mi | zi'e | po | do | zi'e | poi | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
me | and | specific-to | you | and | which | is-red.  
I will sit in my chair (really yours), the red one.  
---  
  

Example 8.41 illustrates that more than two relative phrases or clauses can be connected with __zi'e__. It almost defies colloquial translation because of the very un-English contrast between _pe mi_ , implying that the chair is temporarily connected with me, and _po do_ , implying that the chair has a more permanent association with you. (Perhaps I am a guest in your house, in which case the chair would naturally be your property.)
Here is another example, mixing a relative phrase and two relative clauses, a restrictive one and a non-restrictive one:
**Example 8.42. **
mi | ba | citka | le | dembi | pe | mi | zi'e | poi | cpana  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [future] | eat | the | beans | associated-with | me | and | which | are-upon  
le | mi | palta | zi'e | noi | do | dunda | ke'a |  | mi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| my | plate | and | which-incidentally | you | gave | IT | to | me.  
I'll eat my beans that are on my plate, the ones you gave me.  
---
