## 7.5. Assignable pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the ko'a-series and the broda-series
The following cmavo and gismu are discussed in this section:
ko'a |  KOhA |  ko'a-series |  it-1   
---|---|---|---  
ko'e |  KOhA |  ko'a-series |  it-2  
ko'i |  KOhA |  ko'a-series |  it-3  
ko'o |  KOhA |  ko'a-series |  it-4  
ko'u |  KOhA |  ko'a-series |  it-5  
fo'a |  KOhA |  ko'a-series |  it-6  
fo'e |  KOhA |  ko'a-series |  it-7  
fo'i |  KOhA |  ko'a-series |  it-8  
fo'o |  KOhA |  ko'a-series |  it-9  
fo'u |  KOhA |  ko'a-series |  it-10  
broda |  BRIVLA |  broda-series |  is-thing-1  
brode |  BRIVLA |  broda-series |  is-thing-2  
brodi |  BRIVLA |  broda-series |  is-thing-3  
brodo |  BRIVLA |  broda-series |  is-thing-4  
brodu |  BRIVLA |  broda-series |  is-thing-5  
goi |  GOI |  |  pro-sumti assignment  
cei |  CEI |  |  pro-bridi assignment  
The discussion of personal pro-sumti in Section 7.2 may have seemed incomplete. In English, the personal pronouns include not only “I” and “you” but also “he”, “she”, “it”, and “they”. Lojban does have equivalents of this latter group: in fact, it has more of them than English does. However, they are organized and used very differently.
There are ten cmavo in the ko'a-series, and they may be assigned freely to any sumti whatsoever. The English word “he” can refer only to males, “she” only to females (and ships and a few other things), “it” only to inanimate things, and “they” only to plurals; the cmavo of the ko'a-series have no restrictions at all. Therefore, it is almost impossible to guess from the context what ko'a-series cmavo might refer to if they are just used freely:
**Example 7.21. **
la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci | .i | ko'a | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | goes-to | the | store | . | It-1 | is-blue.  
  

The English gloss “it-1”, plus knowledge about the real world, would tend to make English-speakers believe that __ko'a__ refers to the store; in other words, that its antecedent is _le zarci_. To a Lojbanist, however, _la .alis._ is just as likely an antecedent, in which case Example 7.21 means that Alice, not the store, is blue.
To avoid this pitfall, Lojban employs special syntax, using the cmavo __goi__ :
**Example 7.22. **
la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | goes-to | the | store  
.i | ko'a | goi | la | .alis. | cu | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
. | It-1, | also-known-as | that-named | Alice | , | is-blue.  
  

Syntactically, _goi la .alis._ is a relative phrase (relative phrases are explained in Chapter 8). Semantically, it says that __ko'a__ and _la .alis._ refer to the same thing, and furthermore that this is true because __ko'a__ is being defined as meaning _la .alis._. It is equally correct to say:
**Example 7.23. **
la | .alis. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice | goes-to | the | store  
.i | la | .alis. | goi | ko'a | cu | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
. | That-named | Alice, | also-known-as | it-1, |  | is-blue.  
  

in other words, __goi__ is symmetrical. There is a terminator, __ge'u__ (of selma'o GEhU), which is almost always elidable. The details are in Section 8.3.
The afterthought form of __goi__ shown in Example 7.22 and Example 7.23 is probably most common in speech, where we do not know until part way through our utterance that we will want to refer to Alice again. In writing, though, __ko'a__ may be assigned at the point where Alice is first mentioned. An example of this forethought form of __goi__ is:
**Example 7.24. **
la | .alis. | goi | ko'a | klama | le | zarci | .i | ko'a | cu | blanu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Alice, | also-known-as | it-1, | goes-to | the | store | . | It-1 |  | is-blue.  
  

Again, _ko'a goi la .alis._ would have been entirely acceptable in Example 7.24. This last form is reminiscent of legal jargon: “The party of the first part, hereafter known as Buyer, ...”.
Just as the ko'a-series of pro-sumti allows a substitute for a sumti which is long or complex, or which for some other reason we do not want to repeat, so the broda-series of pro-bridi allows a substitute for a selbri or even a whole bridi:
**Example 7.25. **
ti slasi je mlatu bo cidja lante gacri cei broda .i le crino broda cu barda .i le xunre broda cu cmalu  
---  
These are plastic cat-food can covers or thingies. The green thingy is large. The red thingy is small.  
---  
  

The pro-bridi __broda__ has as its antecedent the selbri _slasi je mlatu bo cidja lante gacri_. The cmavo __cei__ performs the role of __goi__ in assigning __broda__ to this long phrase, and __broda__ can then be used just like any other brivla. (In fact, __broda__ and its relatives actually _are_ brivla: they are gismu in morphology, although they behave exactly like the members of selma'o GOhA. The reasons for using gismu rather than cmavo are buried in the Loglan Project's history.)
Note that pro-bridi are so called because, even though they have the grammar of selbri, their antecedents are whole bridi. In the following rather contrived example, the antecedent of __brode__ is the whole bridi _mi klama le zarci_ :
**Example 7.26. **
mi | klama | cei | brode | le | zarci | .i | do | brode  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | (which-is | claim-1) | the | store | . | You | claim-1.  
I go to the store. You, too.  
---  
  

In the second bridi, _do brode_ means _do klama le zarci_ , because __brode__ carries the x2 sumti of _mi klama le zarci_ along with it. It also potentially carries the x1 sumti as well, but the explicit x1 sumti __do__ overrides the __mi__ of the antecedent bridi. Similarly, any tense or negation that is present in the antecedent is also carried, and can be overridden by explicit tense or negation cmavo on the pro-bridi. These rules hold for all pro-bridi that have antecedents.
Another use of __broda__ and its relatives, without assignment, is as “sample gismu”:
**Example 7.27. **
| broda |  | ke | brode |  | brodi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
a | thing-1 | type-of | ( | thing-2 | type-of | thing-3 | )  
  

represents an abstract pattern, a certain kind of tanru. (Historically, this use was the original one.)
As is explained in Section 17.9, the words for Lojban letters, belonging to selma'o BY and certain related selma'o, are also usable as assignable pro-sumti. The main difference between letter pro-sumti and ko'a-series pro-sumti is that, in the absence of an explicit assignment, letters are taken to refer to the most recent name or description sumti beginning with the same letter:
**Example 7.28. **
mi | viska | le | gerku | .i | gy. | cusku | zo | arf.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | see | the | dog | . | D | expresses | the-word |  “Arf!” | .  
  

The Lojban word __gerku__ begins with _g_ , so the antecedent of __gy.__ , the cmavo for the letter _g_ , must be _le gerku_. In the English translation, we use the same principle to refer to the dog as “D”. Of course, in case of ambiguity, __goi__ can be used to make an explicit assignment.
Furthermore, __goi__ can even be used to assign a name:
**Example 7.29. **
le | ninmu | goi | la | sam. | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | woman | also-known-as | that-named | Sam |  | goes-to | the | store.  
The woman, whom I'll call Sam, goes to the store.  
---  
  

This usage does not imply that the woman's name is Sam, or even that the speaker usually calls the woman “Sam”. “Sam” is simply a name chosen, as if at random, for use in the current context only.
