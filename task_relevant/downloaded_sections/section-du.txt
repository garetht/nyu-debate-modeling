## 7.14. The identity predicate: du
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
du |  GOhA |  identity  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __du__ has the place structure:
> x1 is identical with x2, x3, ...
and appears in selma'o GOhA for reasons of convenience: it is not a pro-bridi. __du__ serves as mathematical “=”, and outside mathematical contexts is used for defining or identifying. Mathematical examples may be found in Chapter 18.
The main difference between
**Example 7.74. **
ko'a | du | le | nanmu  
---|---|---|---  
It-1 | is-identical-to | the | man  
  

and
**Example 7.75. **
ko'a | mintu | le | nanmu  
---|---|---|---  
It-1 | is-the-same-as | the | man  
  

is this defining nature. Example 7.74 presumes that the speaker is responding to a request for information about what __ko'a__ refers to, or that the speaker in some way feels the need to define __ko'a__ for later reference. A bridi with __du__ is an identity sentence, somewhat metalinguistically saying that all attached sumti are representations for the same referent. There may be any number of sumti associated with __du__ , and all are said to be identical.
Example 7.75, however, predicates; it is used to make a claim about the identity of __ko'a__ , which presumably has been defined previously.
Note: __du__ historically is derived from __dunli__ , but __dunli__ has a third place which __du__ lacks: the standard of equality.
