## 10.7. Dimensionality: VIhA
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
vi'i |  VIhA |  on a line  
---|---|---  
vi'a |  VIhA |  in an area  
vi'u |  VIhA |  through a volume  
vi'e |  VIhA |  throughout a space/time interval  
The cmavo of ZEhA are sufficient to express time intervals. One fundamental difference between space and time, however, is that space is multi-dimensional. Sometimes we want to say not only that something moves over a small interval, but also perhaps that it moves in a line. Lojban allows for this. I can specify that a motion “in a small space” is more specifically “in a short line”, “in a small area”, or “through a small volume”.
What about the child walking on the ice in Example 10.23 through Example 10.25? Given the nature of ice, probably the area interpretation is most sensible. I can make this assumption explicit with the appropriate member of selma'o VIhA:
**Example 10.34. **
le | verba | ve'a | vi'a | cadzu | le | bisli  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | child | [medium-space-interval] | [2-dimensional] | walks-on | the | ice.  
In a medium-sized area, the child walks on the ice.  
---  
  

Space intervals can contain either VEhA or VIhA or both, but if both, VEhA must come first, as Example 10.34 shows.
The reader may wish to raise a philosophical point here. (Readers who don't wish to, should skip this paragraph.) The ice may be two-dimensional, or more accurately its surface may be, but since the child is three-dimensional, her walking must also be. The subjective nature of Lojban tense comes to the rescue here: the action is essentially planar, and the third dimension of height is simply irrelevant to walking. Even walking on a mountain could be called __vi'a__ , because relatively speaking the mountain is associated with an essentially two-dimensional surface. Motion which is not confined to such a surface (e.g., flying, or walking through a three-dimensional network of tunnels, or climbing among mountains rather than on a single mountain) would be properly described with __vi'u__. So the cognitive, rather than the physical, dimensionality controls the choice of VIhA cmavo.
VIhA has a member __vi'e__ which indicates a 4-dimensional interval, one that involves both space and time. This allows the spatial tenses to invade, to some degree, the temporal tenses; it is possible to make statements about space-time considered as an Einsteinian whole. (There are presently no cmavo of FAhA assigned to “pastward” and “futureward” considered as space rather than time directions – they could be added, though, if Lojbanists find space-time expression useful.) If a temporal tense cmavo is used in the same tense construct with a __vi'e__ interval, the resulting tense may be self-contradictory.
