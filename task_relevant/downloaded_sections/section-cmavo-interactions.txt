## 19.16. List of cmavo interactions
The following list gives the cmavo and selma'o that are recognized by the earliest stages of the parser, and specifies exactly which of them interact with which others. All of the cmavo are at least mentioned in this chapter. The cmavo are written in lower case, and the selma'o in UPPER CASE.
  * __zo__ quotes the following word, no matter what it is. 
  * __si__ erases the preceding word unless it is a __zo__. 
  * __sa__ erases the preceding word and other words, unless the preceding word is a __zo__. 
  * __su__ is the same as __sa__ , but erases more words. 
  * __lo'u__ quotes all following words up to a __le'u__ (but not a _zo le'u_). 
  * __le'u__ is ungrammatical except at the end of a â€œlo'u quotation. 
  * ZOI cmavo use the following word as a delimiting word, no matter what it is, but using __le'u__ may create difficulties. 
  * __zei__ combines the preceding and the following word into a lujvo, but does not affect __zo__ , __si__ , __sa__ , __su__ , __lo'u__ , ZOI cmavo, __fa'o__ , and __zei__. 
  * BAhE cmavo mark the following word, unless it is __si__ , __sa__ , or __su__ , or unless it is preceded by __zo__. Multiple BAhE cmavo may be used in succession. 
  * __bu__ makes the preceding word into a lerfu word, except for __zo__ , __si__ , __sa__ , __su__ , __lo'u__ , ZOI cmavo, __fa'o__ , __zei__ , BAhE cmavo, and __bu__. Multiple __bu__ cmavo may be used in succession. 
  * UI and CAI cmavo mark the previous word, except for __zo__ , __si__ , __sa__ , __su__ , __lo'u__ , ZOI, __fa'o__ , __zei__ , BAhE cmavo, and __bu__. Multiple UI cmavo may be used in succession. A following __nai__ is made part of the UI. 
  * __.y.__ , __da'o__ , __fu'e__ , and __fu'o__ are the same as UI, but do not absorb a following __nai__.
