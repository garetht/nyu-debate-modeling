## 8.5. Non-veridical relative clauses: _voi_
voi |  NOI |  non-veridical relative clause introducer  
---|---|---  
There is another member of selma'o NOI which serves to introduce a third kind of relative clause: __voi__. Relative clauses introduced by __voi__ are restrictive, like those introduced by __poi__. However, there is a fundamental difference between __poi__ and __voi__ relative clauses. A __poi__ relative clause is said to be veridical, in the same sense that a description using __lo__ or __loi__ is: it is essential to the interpretation that the bridi actually be true. For example:
**Example 8.43. **
le | gerku | poi | blabi | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which | is-white |  | goes.  
  

it must actually be true that the dog is white, or the sentence constitutes a miscommunication. If there is a white dog and a brown dog, and the speaker uses _le gerku poi blabi_ to refer to the brown dog, then the listener will not understand correctly. However,
**Example 8.44. **
le | gerku | voi | blabi | cu | klama  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | dog | which-I-describe-as | white |  | goes.  
  

puts the listener on notice that the dog in question may not actually meet objective standards (whatever they are) for being white: only the speaker can say exactly what is meant by the term. In this way, __voi__ is like __le__ ; the speaker's intention determines the meaning.
As a result, the following two sentences
**Example 8.45. **
le | nanmu | cu | ninmu  
---|---|---|---  
That-which-I-describe-as | a-man |  | is-a-woman.  
The “guy” is actually a gal.  
---  
  

**Example 8.46. **
ti | voi | nanmu | cu | ninmu  
---|---|---|---|---  
This-thing | which-I-describe-as | a-man |  | is-a-woman.  
  

mean essentially the same thing (except that Example 8.46 involves pointing thanks to the use of __ti__ , whereas Example 8.45 doesn't), and neither one is self-contradictory: it is perfectly all right to describe something as a man (although perhaps confusing to the listener) even if it actually is a woman.
