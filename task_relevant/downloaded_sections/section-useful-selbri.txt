## 18.7. Other useful selbri for mekso bridi
So far our examples have been isolated mekso (it is legal to have a bare mekso as a sentence in Lojban) and equation bridi involving __du__. What about inequalities such as “x < 5”? The answer is to use a bridi with an appropriate selbri, thus:
**Example 18.38. **
li | xy. | mleca | li | mu  
---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | x | is-less-than | the-number | 5.  
  

Here is a partial list of selbri useful in mathematical bridi:
_ _du_ _ |  x1 is identical to x2, x3, x4, ...  
---|---  
_ _dunli_ _ |  x1 is equal/congruent to x2 in/on property/quality/dimension/quantity x3  
_ _mleca_ _ |  x1 is less than x2  
_ _zmadu_ _ |  x1 is greater than x2  
_ _dubjavme'a_ _ |  x1 is less than or equal to x2 [__du__ __ja__ __mleca__ , equal or less]  
_ _dubjavmau_ _ |  x1 is greater than or equal to x2 [__du__ __ja__ __zmadu__ , equal or greater]  
_ _tamdu'i_ _ |  x1 is similar to x2 [__tarmi__ __dunli__ , shape-equal]  
_turdu'i_ |  x1 is isomorphic to x2 [__stura__ __dunli__ , structure-equal]  
_ _cmima_ _ |  x1 is a member of set x2  
_gripau_ |  x1 is a subset of set x2 [__girzu__ __pagbu__ , set-part]  
_ _na'ujbi_ _ |  x1 is approximately equal to x2 [__namcu__ __jibni__ , number-near]  
_terci'e_ |  x1 is a component with function x2 of system x3  
Note the difference between __dunli__ and __du__ ; __dunli__ has a third place that specifies the kind of equality that is meant. __du__ refers to actual identity, and can have any number of places:
**Example 18.39. **
py. | du | xy.boi | zy.  
---|---|---|---  
“p” | is-identical-to |  “x” |  “z”  
p = x = z  
  

Lojban bridi can have only one predicate, so the __du__ is not repeated.
Any of these selbri may usefully be prefixed with __na__ , the contradictory negation cmavo, to indicate that the relation is false:
**Example 18.40. **
li | re | su'i | re | na | du | li | mu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | 2 | + | 2 | is-not | equal-to | the-number | 5.  
2 + 2 ≠ 5  
  

As usual in Lojban, negated bridi say what is false, and do not say anything about what might be true.
