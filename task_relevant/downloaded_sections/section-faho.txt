## 19.15. No more to say: FAhO
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
fa'o |  FAhO |  end of text  
---|---|---  
The cmavo __fa'o__ (of selma'o FAhO) is the usually omitted marker for the end of a text; it can be used in computer interaction to indicate the end of input or output, or for explicitly giving up the floor during a discussion. It is outside the regular grammar, and the machine parser takes it as an unconditional signal to stop parsing unless it is quoted with __zo__ or with _lo'u ... le'u_. In particular, it is not used at the end of subordinate texts quoted with __lu__ â€¦ __li'u__ or parenthesized with _to ... toi_.
