## 18.22. Four score and seven: a mekso problem
Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address begins with the words “Four score and seven years ago”. This section exhibits several different ways of saying the number “four score and seven”. (A “score”, for those not familiar with the term, is 20; it is analogous to a “dozen” for 12.) The trivial way:
**Example 18.145. **
li | bize  
---|---  
eight | seven  
87  
  

Example 18.145 is mathematically correct, but sacrifices the spirit of the English words, which are intended to be complex and formal.
**Example 18.146. **
li | vo | pi'i | reno | su'i | ze  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | four | times | twenty | plus | seven  
4 × 20 + 7  
  

Example 18.146 is also mathematically correct, but still misses something. “Score” is not a word for 20 in the same way that “ten” is a word for 10: it contains the implication of 20 objects. The original may be taken as short for “Four score years and seven years ago”. Thinking of a score as a twentysome rather than as 20 leads to:
**Example 18.147. **
li | mo'e | voboi | renomei  
---|---|---|---  
the-number | [sumti-to-mex] | four | twentysomes  
te'u | su'i | ze  
---|---|---  
[end-sumti-to-mex] | plus | seven  
  

In Example 18.147, _voboi renomei_ is a sumti signifying four things each of which are groups of twenty; the __mo'e__ and __te'u__ then make this sumti into a number in order to allow it to be the operand of __su'i__.
Another approach is to think of “score” as setting a representation base. There are remnants of base-20 arithmetic in some languages, notably French, in which 87 is “quatre-vingt-sept”, literally “four-twenties-seven”. (This fact makes the Gettysburg Address hard to translate into French!) If “score” is the representation base, then we have:
**Example 18.148. **
li | vo | pi'e | ze | ju'u | reno  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
the-number | four | ; | seven | base | 20  
4720  
  

Overall, Example 18.147 probably captures the flavor of the English best. Example 18.145 and Example 18.146 are too simple, and Example 18.148 is too tricky. Nevertheless, all four examples are good Lojban. Pedagogically, these examples illustrate the richness of lojbau mekso: anything that can be said at all, can probably be said in more than one way.
