## 15.9. Affirmations
There is an explicit positive form for both selma'o NA (__ja'a__) and selma'o NAhE (__je'a__), each of which would supplant the corresponding negator in the grammatical position used, allowing one to assert the positive in response to a negative question or statement without confusion. Assuming the same context as in Section 15.8:
**Example 15.89. **
xu | na | go'i  
---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that | [false] | [repeat-previous]?  
  

or equivalently
**Example 15.90. **
xu | la | djan. | [cu] | na | pu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Is-it-true-that: | that-named | John |  | [false] | previously  
klama | la | paris. | .e | la | rom.  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
went-to | that-name | Paris | and | that-named | Rome.  
  

The obvious, but incorrect, positive response to this negative question is:
**Example 15.91. **
go'i  
---  
[repeat-previous]  
---  
  

A plain __go'i__ does not mean “Yes it is”; it merely abbreviates repeating the previous statement unmodified, including any negators present; and Example 15.91 actually states that it is false that John went to both Paris and Rome.
When considering:
**Example 15.92. **
na | go'i  
---|---  
[false] | [repeat-previous]  
  

as a response to a negative question like Example 15.90, Lojban designers had to choose between two equally plausible interpretations with opposite effects. Does Example 15.92 create a double negative in the sentence by adding a new __na__ to the one already there (forming a double negative and hence a positive statement), or does the __na__ replace the previous one, leaving the sentence unchanged?
It was decided that substitution, the latter alternative, is the preferable choice, since it is then clear whether we intend a positive or a negative sentence without performing any manipulations. This is the way English usually works, but not all languages work this way – Russian, Japanese, and Navajo all interpret a negative reply to a negative question as positive.
The positive assertion cmavo of selma'o NA, which is "ja'a", can also replace the __na__ in the context, giving:
**Example 15.93. **
ja'a | go'i  
---|---  
[true] | [repeat-previous]  
John did go to Paris and Rome.  
---  
  

__ja'a__ can replace __na__ in a similar manner wherever the latter is used:
**Example 15.94. **
mi | ja'a | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [true] | go-to | the | store  
I indeed go to the store.  
---  
  

__je'a__ can replace __na'e__ in exactly the same way, stating that scalar negation does not apply, and that the relation indeed holds as stated. In the absence of a negation context, it emphasizes the positive:
**Example 15.95. **
ta | je'a | melbi  
---|---|---  
that | is-indeed | beautiful.
