## 5.10. selbri based on sumti: _me_
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
me |  ME |  changes sumti to simple selbri  
---|---|---  
me'u |  MEhU |  terminator for __me__  
A sumti can be made into a simple selbri by preceding it with __me__ (of selma'o ME) and following it with the elidable terminator __me'u__ (of selma'o MEhU). This makes a selbri with the place structure
> x1 is one of the referents of “[the sumti]”
which is true of the thing, or things, that are the referents of the sumti, and not of anything else. For example, consider the sumti
**Example 5.98. **
le | ci | nolraitru  
---|---|---  
the | three | noblest-governors  
the three kings  
---  
  

If these are understood to be the Three Kings of Christian tradition, who arrive every year on January 6, then we may say:
**Example 5.99. **
la | BALtazar. | cu | me | le ci nolraitru  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Balthazar |  | is-one-of-the-referents-of |  “the three kings.”  
Balthazar is one of the three kings.  
---  
  

and likewise
**Example 5.100. **
la | kaspar. | cu | me | le | ci | nolraitru  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Caspar is one of the three kings.  
---  
  

and
**Example 5.101. **
la | melxi,or. | cu | me | le | ci | nolraitru  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Melchior is one of the three kings.  
---  
  

If the sumti refers to a single object, then the effect of __me__ is much like that of __du__ :
**Example 5.102. **
do | du | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---  
You | are-identical-with | that-named |  “John.”  
You are John.  
---  
  

means the same as
**Example 5.103. **
do | me | la djan.  
---|---|---  
You | are-the-referent-of |  “that-named ‘John’.”  
You are John.  
---  
  

It is common to use __me__ selbri, especially those based on name sumti using __la__ , as seltau. For example:
**Example 5.104. **
ta | me | lai kraislr. | [me'u] | karce  
---|---|---|---|---  
That | (is-a-referent-of |  “the-mass-named ‘Chrysler’” | ) | car.  
That is a Chrysler car.  
---  
  

The elidable terminator __me'u__ can usually be omitted. It is absolutely required only if the __me__ selbri is being used in an indefinite description (a type of sumti explained in Section 6.8), and if the indefinite description is followed by a relative clause (explained in Chapter 8) or a sumti logical connective (explained in Section 14.6). Without a __me'u__ , the relative clause or logical connective would appear to belong to the sumti embedded in the __me__ expression. Here is a contrasting pair of sentences:
**Example 5.105. **
re | me | le | ci | nolraitru | .e | la | djan. | [me'u] | cu | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two of the group “the three kings and John” are white.  
---  
  

**Example 5.106. **
re | me | le | ci | nolraitru | me'u | .e | la | djan. | cu | blabi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Two of the three kings, and John, are white.  
---  
  

In Example 5.105 the __me__ selbri covers the three kings plus John, and the indefinite description picks out two of them that are said to be white: we cannot say which two. In Example 5.106, though, the __me__ selbri covers only the three kings: two of them are said to be white, and so is John.
Finally, here is another example requiring __me'u__ :
**Example 5.107. **
ta | me la'e le se cusku be do | me'u |  | cukta  
---|---|---|---|---  
That | is-a-(what-you-said) |  | type-of | book.  
That is the kind of book you were talking about.  
---  
  

There are other sentences where either __me'u__ or some other elidable terminator must be expressed:
**Example 5.108. **
le | me le ci nolraitru | [ku] | me'u | nunsalci  
---|---|---|---|---  
the | (the three kings) |  |  | type-of-event-of-celebrating  
the Three Kings celebration  
---  
  

requires either __ku__ or __me'u__ to be explicit, and (as with __be'o__ in Section 5.7) the __me'u__ leaves no doubt which cmavo it is paired with.
