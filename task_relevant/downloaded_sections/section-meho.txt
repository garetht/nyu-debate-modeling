## 17.10. References to lerfu
The rules of Section 17.9 make it impossible to use unmarked lerfu words to refer to lerfu themselves. In the sentence:
**Example 17.28. **
.abu | cu | lerfu  
---|---|---  
A |  | is-a-letteral.  
  

the hearer would try to find what previous sumti __.abu__ refers to. The solution to this problem makes use of the cmavo __me'o__ of selma'o LI, which makes a lerfu string into a sumti representing that very string of lerfu. This use of __me'o__ is a special case of its mathematical use, which is to introduce a mathematical expression used literally rather than for its value.
**Example 17.29. **
me'o | .abu | cu | lerfu  
---|---|---|---  
The-expression “a” is-a-letteral.  
---  
  

Now we can translate Example 17.1 into Lojban:
**Example 17.30. **
dei | vasru | vo | lerfu | po'u | me'o | .ebu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
this-sentence | contains | four | letterals | which-are | the-expression |  “e”  
This sentence contains four “e” s.  
---  
  

Since the Lojban sentence has only four _e_ lerfu rather than fourteen, the translation is not a literal one – but Example 17.31 is a Lojban truth just as Example 17.1 is an English truth. Coincidentally, the colloquial English translation of Example 17.31 is also true!
The reader might be tempted to use quotation with __lu__ … __li'u__ instead of __me'o__ , producing:
**Example 17.31. **
lu | .abu | li'u | cu | lerfu  
---|---|---|---|---  
[quote] | .abu | [unquote] |  | is-a-letteral.  
  

(The single-word quote __zo__ cannot be used, because __.abu__ is a compound cmavo.) But Example 17.31 is false, because it says:
**Example 17.32. **
The word __.abu__ is a letteral
  

which is not the case; rather, the thing symbolized by the word __.abu__ is a letteral. In Lojban, that would be:
**Example 17.33. **
la'e | lu | .abu | li'u | cu | lerfu  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-referent-of | [quote] | .abu | [unquote] |  | is-a-letteral.  
  

which is correct.
