## 17.4. The universal _bu_
So far we have seen __bu__ only as a suffix to vowel cmavo to produce vowel lerfu words. Originally, this was the only use of __bu__. In developing the lerfu word system, however, it proved to be useful to allow __bu__ to be attached to any word whatsoever, in order to allow arbitrary extensions of the basic lerfu word set.
Formally, __bu__ may be attached to any single Lojban word. Compound cmavo do not count as words for this purpose. The special cmavo __ba'e__ , __za'e__ , __zei__ , __zo__ , __zoi__ , __la'o__ , __lo'u__ , __si__ , __sa__ , __su__ , and __fa'o__ may not have __bu__ attached, because they are interpreted before __bu__ detection is done; in particular,

is needed when discussing __bu__ in Lojban. It is also illegal to attach __bu__ to itself, but more than one __bu__ may be attached to a word; thus _.abubu_ is legal, if ugly. (Its meaning is not defined, but it is presumably different from __.abu__.) It does not matter if the word is a cmavo, a cmene, or a brivla. All such words suffixed by __bu__ are treated grammatically as if they were cmavo belonging to selma'o BY. However, if the word is a cmene it is always necessary to precede and follow it by a pause, because otherwise the cmene may absorb preceding or following words.
The ability to attach __bu__ to words has been used primarily to make names for various logograms and other unusual characters. For example, the Lojban name for the “happy face” is _.uibu_ , based on the attitudinal __.ui__ that means “happiness”. Likewise, the “smiley face”, written “:-)” and used on computer networks to indicate humor, is called _zo'obu_ The existence of these names does not mean that you should insert _.uibu_ into running Lojban text to indicate that you are happy, or _zo'obu_ when something is funny; instead, use the appropriate attitudinal directly.
Likewise, _joibu_ represents the ampersand character, “&”, based on the cmavo __joi__ meaning “mixed and”. Many more such lerfu words will probably be invented in future.
The _._ and _,_ characters used in Lojbanic writing to represent pause and syllable break respectively have been assigned the lerfu words _denpa bu_ (literally, “pause bu”) and _slaka bu_ (literally, “syllable bu”). The written space is mandatory here, because __denpa__ and __slaka__ are normal gismu with normal stress: _denpabu_ would be a fu'ivla (word borrowed from another language into Lojban) stressed _denPAbu_. No pause is required between __denpa__ (or __slaka__) and __bu__ , though.
