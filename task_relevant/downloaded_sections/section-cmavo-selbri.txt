## 5.9. Other kinds of simple selbri
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
go'i |  GOhA |  repeats the previous bridi  
---|---|---  
du |  GOhA |  equality  
nu'a |  NUhA |  math operator to selbri  
moi |  MOI |  changes number to ordinal selbri  
mei |  MOI |  changes number to cardinal selbri  
nu |  NU |  event abstraction  
kei |  KEI |  terminator for NU  
So far we have only discussed brivla and tanru built up from brivla as possible selbri. In fact, there are a few other constructions in Lojban which are grammatically equivalent to brivla: they can be used either directly as selbri, or as components in tanru. Some of these types of simple selbri are discussed at length in Chapter 7, Chapter 11, and Chapter 18; but for completeness these types are mentioned here with a brief explanation and an example of their use in selbri.
The cmavo of selma'o GOhA (with one exception) serve as pro-bridi, providing a reference to the content of other bridi; none of them has a fixed meaning. The most commonly used member of GOhA is probably __go'i__ , which amounts to a repetition of the previous bridi, or part of it. If I say:
**Example 5.89. **
la | djan. | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | goes-to | the | market.  
  

you may retort:
**Example 5.90. **
la | djan. | go'i | troci  
---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | [repeat-last] | are-a-trier.  
John tries to.  
---  
  

Example 5.90 is short for:
**Example 5.91. **
la | djan. | klama | be | le | zarci | be'o |  | troci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | John | is-a-goer | ( | to-the | market | ) | type-of | trier.  
  

because the whole bridi of Example 5.89 has been packaged up into the single word __go'i__ and inserted into Example 5.90.
The exceptional member of GOhA is __du__ , which represents the relation of identity. Its place structure is:
> x1 is identical with x2, x3, ...
for as many places as are given. More information on selma'o GOhA is available in Chapter 7.
Lojban mathematical expressions (mekso) can be incorporated into selbri in two different ways. Mathematical operators such as __su'i__ , meaning “plus”, can be transformed into selbri by prefixing them with __nu'a__ (of selma'o NUhA). The resulting place structure is:
> x1 is the result of applying (the operator) to arguments x2, x3, etc.
for as many arguments as are required. (The result goes in the x1 place because the number of following places may be indefinite.) For example:
**Example 5.92. **
li | vo | nu'a su'i | li | re | li | re  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The-number | 4 | is-the-sum-of | the-number | 2 | and-the-number | 2.  
  

A possible tanru example might be:
**Example 5.93. **
mi | jimpe | tu'a | loi | nu'a su'i | nabmi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | understand | something-about | the-mass-of | is-the-sum-of | problems.  
I understand addition problems.  
---  
  

More usefully, it is possible to combine a mathematical expression with a cmavo of selma'o MOI to create one of various numerical selbri. Details are available in Section 18.11. Here are a few tanru:
**Example 5.94. **
la | prim. | palvr. | pamoi | cusku  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Preem | Palver | is-the-1-th | speaker.  
Preem Palver is the first speaker.  
---  
  

**Example 5.95. **
la | an,iis. | joi | la | .asun.  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | Anyi | massed-with | that-named | Asun  
bruna | remei  
---|---  
are-a-brother | type-of-twosome.  
Anyi and Asun are two brothers.  
---  
  

Finally, an important type of simple selbri which is not a brivla is the abstraction. Grammatically, abstractions are simple: a cmavo of selma'o NU, followed by a bridi, followed by the elidable terminator __kei__ of selma'o KEI. Semantically, abstractions are an extremely subtle and powerful feature of Lojban whose full ramifications are documented in Chapter 11. A few examples:
**Example 5.96. **
ti | nu | zdile | kei | kumfa  
---|---|---|---|---  
This | is-an-event-of | amusement |  | room.  
This is an amusement room.  
---  
  

Example 5.96 is quite distinct in meaning from:
**Example 5.97. **
ti | zdile | kumfa  
---|---|---  
This | is-an-amuser | room.  
  

which suggests the meaning “a room that amuses someone”.
