## 15.5. Expressing scales in selbri negation
In expressing a scalar negation, we can provide some indication of the scale, range, frame-of-reference, or universe of discourse that is being dealt with in an assertion. As stated in Section 15.4, the default is the set of plausible alternatives. Thus if we say:
**Example 15.62. **
le | stizu | cu | na'e | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | is-a-non- | (red-thing).  
  

the pragmatic interpretation is that we mean a different color and not
**Example 15.63. **
le | stizu | cu | dzukla | be | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | walkingly-goes | to | the | market.  
  

However, if we have reason to be more explicit (an obtuse or contrary listener, or simply an overt logical analysis), we can clarify that we are referring to a color by saying:
**Example 15.64. **
le | stizu | cu | na'e | xunre | skari  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | (is-of-a-non | red) | color.  
  

We might also have reduced the pragmatic ambiguity by making the two trailing sumti values explicit (the “as perceived by” and “under conditions” places have been added to the place structure of __xunre__). But assume we have a really stubborn listener (an artificially semi-intelligent computer?) who will find a way to misinterpret Example 15.64 even with three specific sumti provided.
In this case, we use a sumti tagged with the sumti tcita __ci'u__ , which translates roughly as “on a scale of X”, where `X` is the sumti. For maximal clarity, the tagged sumti can be bound into the negated selbri with __be__. To clarify Example 15.64, we might say:
**Example 15.65. **
le | stizu | cu | na'e | xunre | be | ci'u | loka | skari  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | is-non | (red | on | a-scale-of | a-property | color-ness).  
  

We can alternately use the sumti tcita __teci'e__ , based on __ciste__ , which translates roughly as “of a system of components X”, for universes of discourse; in this case, we would express Example 15.64 as:
**Example 15.66. **
le | stizu | cu | na'e | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | is-a-non | (red  
be | teci'e | le | skari  
---|---|---|---  
of | a-system | with-components-the | colors)-thing.  
  

Other places of __ciste__ can be brought out using the grammar of selma'o BAI modals, allowing slightly different forms of expression, thus:
**Example 15.67. **
le | stizu | cu | na'e | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | is-a-non | (red  
be | ci'e | lo'i | skari  
---|---|---|---  
of | a-system | which-is-the-set-of | colors)-thing.  
  

The cmavo __le'a__ , also in selma'o BAI, can be used to specify a category:
**Example 15.68. **
le | stizu | cu | na'e | xunre  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | is-a-non | (red  
be | le'a | lo'i | skari  
---|---|---|---  
of | a-category | which-is-the-set-of | colors)-thing.  
  

which is minimally different in meaning from Example 15.67.
The cmavo __na'e__ is not the only member of selma'o NAhE. If we want to express a scalar negation which is a polar opposite, we use the cmavo __to'e__ , which is grammatically equivalent to __na'e__ :
**Example 15.69. **
le | stizu | cu | to'e | xunre | be | ci'u | loka | skari  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | chair |  | is-a-(opposite-of | red) | on | scale | a-property-of | color-ness.  
  

Likewise, the midpoint of a scale can be expressed with the cmavo __no'e__ , also grammatically equivalent to __na'e__. Here are some parallel examples of __na'e__ , __no'e__ , and __to'e__ :
**Example 15.70. **
ta | melbi  
---|---  
That | is-beautiful.  
  

**Example 15.71. **
ta | na'e | melbi  
---|---|---  
That | is-other-than | beautiful.  
That is ugly [in one sense].  
---  
  

**Example 15.72. **
ta | no'e | melbi  
---|---|---  
That | is-neutrally | beautiful.  
That is plain/ordinary-looking (neither ugly nor beautiful).  
---  
  

**Example 15.73. **
ta | to'e | melbi  
---|---|---  
That | is-opposite-of | beautiful.  
That is ugly/very ugly/repulsive.  
---  
  

The cmavo __to'e__ has the assigned rafsi _-tol-_ and _-to'e-_ ; the cmavo __no'e__ has the assigned rafsi _-nor-_ and _-no'e-_. The selbri in Example 15.71 through Example 15.73 could be replaced by the lujvo _nalmle_ , _normle_ , and __tolmle__ respectively.
This large variety of scalar negations is provided because different scales have different properties. Some scales are open-ended in both directions: there is no “ultimately ugly” or “ultimately beautiful”. Other scales, like temperature, are open at one end and closed at the other: there is a minimum temperature (so-called “absolute zero”) but no maximum temperature. Still other scales are closed at both ends.
Correspondingly, some selbri have no obvious __to'e__ \- what is the opposite of a dog? – while others have more than one, and need __ci'u__ to specify which opposite is meant.
