## 8.10. Relative clauses within relative clauses
For the most part, these are straightforward and uncomplicated: a sumti that is part of a relative clause bridi may itself be modified by a relative clause:
**Example 8.81. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | blanu | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | is-blue |  | is-slow.  
  

However, an ambiguity can exist if __ke'a__ is used in a relative clause within a relative clause: does it refer to the outermost sumti, or to the sumti within the outer relative clause to which the inner relative clause is attached? The latter. To refer to the former, use a subscript on __ke'a__ :
**Example 8.82. **
le | prenu | poi | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'axire | zbasu | ke'a | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | person | who | is-in | the | room | which | IT-sub-2 | built | IT |  | is-slow.  
The person who is in the room which he built is slow.  
---  
  

Here, the meaning of “IT-sub-2” is that sumti attached to the second relative clause, counting from the innermost, is used. Therefore, _ke'axipa_ (IT-sub-1) means the same as plain __ke'a__.
Alternatively, you can use a prenex (explained in full in Chapter 16), which is syntactically a series of sumti followed by the special cmavo __zo'u__ , prefixed to the relative clause bridi:
**Example 8.83. **
le | prenu | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'a | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | man | who | (IT | = | it1 | :  
ko'a | zvati | le | kumfa | poi | ke'a | goi | ko'e | zo'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | is-in | the | room | which | (IT | = | it2 | :  
ko'a | zbasu | ko'e | cu | masno  
---|---|---|---|---  
it1 | built | it2) |  | is-slow.  
  

Example 8.83 is more verbose than Example 8.82, but may be clearer, since it explicitly spells out the two __ke'a__ cmavo, each on its own level, and assigns them to the assignable cmavo __ko'a__ and __ko'e__ (explained in Section 7.5).
