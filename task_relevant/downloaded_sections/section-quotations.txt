## 19.9. Quotations: LU, LIhU, LOhU, LEhU
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
lu |  LU |  begin quotation  
---|---|---  
li'u |  LIhU |  end quotation  
lo'u |  LOhU |  begin error quotation  
le'u |  LEhU |  end error quotation  
Grammatically, quotations are very simple in Lojban: all of them are sumti, and they all mean something like “the piece of text here quoted”:
**Example 19.43. **
mi | pu | cusku | lu | mi'e | .djan. | [li'u]  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [past] | express | [quote] | I-am | John | [unquote]  
I said, “I'm John”.  
---  
  

But in fact there are four different flavors of quotation in the language, involving six cmavo of six different selma'o. This being the case, quotation deserves some elaboration.
The simplest kind of quotation, exhibited in Example 19.43, uses the cmavo __lu__ (of selma'o LU) as the opening quotation mark, and the cmavo __li'u__ (of selma'o LIhU) as the closing quotation mark. The text between __lu__ and __li'u__ must be a valid, parseable Lojban text. If the quotation is ungrammatical, so is the surrounding expression. The cmavo __li'u__ is technically an elidable terminator, but it's almost never possible to elide it except at the end of text.
The cmavo __lo'u__ (of selma'o LOhU) and __le'u__ (of selma'o LEhU) are used to surround a quotation that is not necessarily grammatical Lojban. However, the text must consist of morphologically correct Lojban words (as defined in Chapter 4), so that the __le'u__ can be picked out reliably. The words need not be meaningful, but they must be recognizable as cmavo, brivla, or cmene. Quotation with __lo'u__ is essential to quoting ungrammatical Lojban for teaching in the language, the equivalent of the * that is used in English to mark such errors:
**Example 19.44. **
lo'u | mi du do du la djan. | le'u  
---|---|---  
[quote] | mi du do du la djan. | [unquote]  
na | tergerna | la | lojban.  
---|---|---|---  
is-not | a-grammatical-structure | in | Lojban.  
  

Example 19.44 is grammatical even though the embedded quotation is not. Similarly, __lo'u__ quotation can quote fragments of a text which themselves do not constitute grammatical utterances:
**Example 19.45. **
lu | le mlatu cu viska le finpe | li'u | zo'u  
---|---|---|---  
[quote] | le mlatu cu viska le finpe | [unquote] | :  
lo'u | viska le | le'u | cu | selbasti  
---|---|---|---|---  
[quote] | viska le | [unquote] |  | is-replaced-by  
.ei | lo'u | viska lo | le'u  
---|---|---|---  
[obligation!] | [quote] | viska lo | [unquote].  
In the sentence _le mlatu viska le finpe_ , _viska le_ should be replaced by _viska lo_.  
---  
  

Note the topic-comment formulation (Section 19.4) and the indicator applying to the selbri only (Section 19.8). Neither _viska le_ nor _viska lo_ is a valid Lojban utterance, and both require __lo'u__ quotation.
Additionally, pro-sumti or pro-bridi in the quoting sentence can refer to words appearing in the quoted sentence when __lu__ … __li'u__ is used, but not when _lo'u ... le'u_ is used:
**Example 19.46. **
la | tcarlis. | cusku | lu | le | ninmu | cu | morsi | li'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| Charlie | says | [quote] | the | woman |  | is-dead | [unquote].  
.iku'i | ri | jmive  
---|---|---  
However, | the-last-mentioned | is-alive.  
Charlie says “The woman is dead”, but she is alive.  
---  
  

In Example 19.46, __ri__ is a pro-sumti which refers to the most recent previous sumti, namely _le ninmu_. Compare:
**Example 19.47. **
la | tcarlis. | cusku | lo'u | le | ninmu | cu | morsi | le'u  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| Charlie | says | [quote] | le | ninmu | cu | morsi | [unquote].  
.iku'i | ri | jmive  
---|---|---  
However, | the-last-mentioned | is-alive.  
Charlie says _le ninmu cu morsi_ , but he is alive.  
---  
  

In Example 19.47, __ri__ cannot refer to the referent of the alleged sumti _le ninmu_ , because _le ninmu cu morsi_ is a mere uninterpreted sequence of Lojban words. Instead, __ri__ ends up referring to the referent of the sumti _la tcarlis._ , and so it is Charlie who is alive.
The metalinguistic erasers __si__ , __sa__ , and __su__ , discussed in Section 19.13, do not operate in text between __lo'u__ and __le'u__. Since the first __le'u__ terminates a __lo'u__ quotation, it is not directly possible to have a __lo'u__ quotation within another __lo'u__ quotation. However, it is possible for a __le'u__ to occur within a _lo'u ... le'u_ quotation by preceding it with the cmavo __zo__ , discussed in Section 19.10. Note that __le'u__ is not an elidable terminator; it is required.
