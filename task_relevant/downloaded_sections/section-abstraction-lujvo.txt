## 12.12. Abstract lujvo
The cmavo of NU can participate in the construction of lujvo of a particularly simple and well-patterned kind. Consider that old standard example, __klama__ :
**Example 12.56. **
> k1 comes/goes to k2 from k3 via route k4 by means k5.
  

The selbri _nu klama [kei]_ has only one place, the event-of-going, but the full five places exist implicitly between __nu__ and __kei__ , since a full bridi with all sumti may be placed there. In a lujvo, there is no room for such inside places, and consequently the lujvo __nunkla__ (_nun-_ is the rafsi for __nu__), needs to have six places:
**Example 12.57. **
> nu1 is the event of k1's coming/going to k2 from k3 via route k4 by means k5.
  

Here the first place of _nunklama_ is the first and only place of __nu__ , and the other five places have been pushed down by one to occupy the second through the sixth places. Full information on __nu__ , as well as the other abstractors mentioned in this section, is given in Chapter 11.
For those abstractors which have a second place as well, the standard convention is to place this place after, rather than before, the places of the brivla being abstracted. The place structure of _nilkla_ , the lujvo derived from _ni klama_ , is the imposing:
**Example 12.58. **
> ni1 is the amount of k1's coming/going to k2 from k3 via route k4 by means k5, measured on scale ni2.
  

It is not uncommon for abstractors to participate in the making of more complex lujvo as well. For example, _nunsoidji_ , from the veljvo
**Example 12.59. **
nu | sonci | kei | djica  
---|---|---|---  
event-of | being-a-soldier |  | desirer  
  

has the place structure
**Example 12.60. **
> d1 desires the event of (s1 being a soldier of army s2) for purpose d3
  

where the d2 place has disappeared altogether, being replaced by the places of the seltau. As shown in Example 12.60, the ordering follows this idea of replacement: the seltau places are inserted at the point where the omitted abstraction place exists in the tertau.
The lujvo _nunsoidji_ is quite different from the ordinary asymmetric lujvo _soidji_ , a “soldier desirer”, whose place structure is just
**Example 12.61. **
> d1 desires (a soldier of army s2) for purpose d3
  

A _nunsoidji_ might be someone who is about to enlist, whereas a _soidji_ might be a camp-follower.
One use of abstract lujvo is to eliminate the need for explicit __kei__ in tanru: _nunkalri gasnu_ means much the same as _nu kalri kei gasnu_ , but is shorter. In addition, many English words ending in _-hood_ are represented with _nun-_ lujvo, and other words ending in “-ness” or “-dom” are often representable with _kam-_ lujvo (_kam-_ is the rafsi for __ka__); __kambla__ is “blueness”.
Even though the cmavo of NU are long-scope in nature, governing the whole following bridi, the NU rafsi should generally be used as short-scope modifiers, like the SE and NAhE rafsi discussed in Section 12.9.
There is also a rafsi for the cmavo __jai__ , namely _jax_ , which allows sentences like
**Example 12.62. **
mi | jai | rinka | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-associated-with | causing | the | event-of | your | death.  
I cause your death.  
---  
  

explained in Section 11.10, to be rendered with lujvo:
**Example 12.63. **
mi | jaxri'a | le | nu | do | morsi  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | am-part-of-the-cause-of | the | event-of | your | dying.  
  

In making a lujvo that contains _jax-_ for a selbri that contains __jai__ , the rule is to leave the __fai__ place as a __fai__ place of the lujvo; it does not participate in the regular lujvo place structure. (The use of __fai__ is explained in Section 9.12 and Section 10.22.)
