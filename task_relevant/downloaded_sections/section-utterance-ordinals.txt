## 19.7. Utterance ordinals: MAI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
mai |  MAI |  utterance ordinal, -thly  
---|---|---  
mo'o |  MAI |  higher order utterance ordinal  
Numerical free modifiers, corresponding to English “firstly”, “secondly”, and so on, can be created by suffixing __mai__ or __mo'o__ of selma'o MAI to a number or a lerfu string. Here are some examples:
**Example 19.36. **
mi | klama | pamai | le | zarci | .e | remai | le | zdani  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | go-to | (firstly) | the | store | and | (secondly) | the | house.  
  

This does not imply that I go to the store before I go to the house: that meaning requires a tense. The sumti are simply numbered for convenience of reference. Like other free modifiers, the utterance ordinals can be inserted almost anywhere in a sentence without affecting its grammar or its meaning.
Any of the Lojban numbers can be used with MAI: __romai__ , for example, means “all-thly” or “lastly”. Likewise, if you are enumerating a long list and have forgotten which number is wanted next, you can say _ny.mai_ , or “Nthly”.
The difference between __mai__ and __mo'o__ is that __mo'o__ enumerates larger subdivisions of a text; __mai__ was designed for lists of numbered items, whereas __mo'o__ was intended to subdivide structured works. If this chapter were translated into Lojban, it might number each section with __mo'o__ : this section would then be introduced with _zemo'o_ , or “Section 7.”
