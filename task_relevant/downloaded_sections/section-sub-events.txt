## 10.21. Sub-events
Another application of non-logical tense connection is to talk about sub-events of events. Consider a six-shooter: a gun which can fire six bullets in succession before reloading. If I fire off the entire magazine twice, I can express the fact in Lojban thus:
**Example 10.159. **
mi | reroi | pi'u | xaroi | cecla  
---|---|---|---|---  
I | [twice] | [cross-product] | [six-times] | shoot  
le | seldanti  
---|---  
the | projectile-launcher.  
On two occasions, I fire the gun six times.  
---  
  

It would be confusing, though grammatical, to run the __reroi__ and the _xaroi_ directly together. However, the non-logical connective __pi'u__ expresses a Cartesian product (also known as a cross product) of two sets. In this case, there is a set of two firings each of which is represented by a set of six shots, for twelve shots in all (hence the name “product”: the product of 2 and 6 is 12). Its use specifies very precisely what occurs.
In fact, you can specify strings of interval properties and event contours within a single tense without the use of a logical or non-logical connective cmavo. This allows tenses of the type:
**Example 10.160. **
la | djordj. | ca'o | co'a | ciska  
---|---|---|---|---  
That-named | George | [continuitive] | [initiative] | writes.  
George continues to start to write.  
---  
  

**Example 10.161. **
mi | reroi | ca'o | xaroi | darxi | le | damri  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | [twice] | [continuitive] | [six-times] | hit | the | drum.  
On two occasions, I continue to beat the drum six times.
