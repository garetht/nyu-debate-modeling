## 10.22. Conversion of sumti tcita: JAI
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
jai |  JAI |  tense conversion  
---|---|---  
fai |  FA |  indefinite place  
Conversion is the regular Lojban process of moving around the places of a place structure. The cmavo of selma'o SE serve this purpose, exchanging the first place with one of the others:
**Example 10.162. **
mi | cu | klama | le | zarci  
---|---|---|---|---  
I |  | go-to | the | market.  
  

**Example 10.163. **
le | zarci | cu | se klama | mi  
---|---|---|---|---  
The | market |  | is-gone-to | by-me.  
  

It is also possible to bring a place that is specified by a sumti tcita (for the purposes of this chapter, a tense sumti tcita) to the front, by using __jai__ plus the tense as the grammatical equivalent of SE:
**Example 10.164. **
le | ratcu | cu | citka | le | cirla | vi | le | panka  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | rat |  | eats | the | cheese | [short-distance] | the | park.  
The rat eats the cheese in the park.  
---  
  

**Example 10.165. **
le | panka | cu | jai vi | citka | le | cirla | fai | le | ratcu  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The | park |  | is-the-place-of | eating | the | cheese | by | the | rat.  
The park is where the rat eats the cheese.  
---  
  

In Example 10.165, the construction JAI+tense converts the location sumti into the first place. The previous first place has nowhere to go, since the location sumti is not a numbered place; however, it can be inserted back into the bridi with __fai__ , the indefinite member of selma'o FA.
(The other members of FA are used to mark the first, second, etc. places of a bridi explicitly:
**Example 10.166. **
fa mi cu klama fe le zarci
  

means the same as
**Example 10.167. **
fe le zarci cu klama fa mi
  

as well as the simple
**Example 10.168. **
mi cu klama le zarci
  

in which the place structure is determined by position.)
Like SE conversion, JAI+tense conversion is especially useful in descriptions with LE selma'o:
**Example 10.169. **
mi | viska | le | jai vi | citka | be | le | cirla  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | saw | the | place-of | eating |  | the | cheese.  
  

Here the eater of the cheese is elided, so no __fai__ appears.
Of course, temporal tenses are also usable with JAI:
**Example 10.170. **
mi | djuno | fi | le | jai | ca | morsi | be | fai | la | djan.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
I | know | about | the |  | [present] | is-dead |  | of | that-named |  “John” | .  
I know the time of John's death.  
---  
I know when John died.
