## 4.9. Rules for inserting pauses
Summarized in one place, here are the rules for inserting pauses between Lojban words:
  1. Any two words may have a pause between them; it is always illegal to pause in the middle of a word, because that breaks up the word into two words.
  2. Every word ending in a consonant must be followed by a pause. Necessarily, all such words are cmene.
  3. Every word beginning with a vowel must be preceded by a pause. Such words are either cmavo, fu'ivla, or cmene; all gismu and lujvo begin with consonants.
  4. Every cmene must be preceded by a pause, unless the immediately preceding word is one of the cmavo __la__ , __lai__ , __la'i__ , or __doi__ (which is why those strings are forbidden in cmene). However, the situation triggering this rule rarely occurs.
  5. If the last syllable of a word bears the stress, and a brivla follows, the two must be separated by a pause, to prevent confusion with the primary stress of the brivla. In this case, the first word must be either a cmavo or a cmene with unusual stress (which already ends with a pause, of course).
  6. A cmavo of the form “Cy” must be followed by a pause unless another “Cy”-form cmavo follows.
  7. When non-Lojban text is embedded in Lojban, it must be preceded and followed by pauses. (How to embed non-Lojban text is explained in Section 19.10.)
