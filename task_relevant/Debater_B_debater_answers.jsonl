{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. The English \"I think we need to hurry up\" functions as a hedge or internal reflection, not as a statement backed by explicit evidence. Lojban distinguishes between the gismu <quote>pensi – x1 thinks/considers/cogitates/reasons/is pensive about/reflects upon subject/concept x2</quote> and <quote>jinvi – x1 thinks/opines x2 [opinion] (du'u) is true about subject/issue x3 on grounds x4</quote>.\n2. Here, no grounds (x4) are offered for an opinion; the speaker merely reflects on necessity. Thus <quote>pensi</quote> is the appropriate predicate, matching the nuance of personal reflection without requiring evidence.\n3. By contrast, using <quote>jinvi</quote> wrongly implies that the speaker has some specified grounds for the belief, which the English does not supply. This overstates the force of \"I think\".\n4. Therefore, the better translation is A: <quote>mi pensi lo du'u mi'a nitcu lo ka sutryze'a</quote>, correctly rendering \"I think we need to hurry up\" as internal pondering of that proposition."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. In Lojban, compounding relies on the *second* word serving as the head selbri, determining which place structure is used, and the *first* word filling one of its places.  For the gismu tcati, the place structure is “x1 is a quantity of tea brewed from leaves x2.”  As given in the background, <quote>tcati: x1 is made of/contains/is a quantity of tea brewed from leaves x2.</quote>  \n2. In the compound “tcati plise,” tcati is the head and plise fills its x2 place—i.e. leaves x2 are apples—so x1 is tea brewed from apples (\"apple tea\").  This matches exactly “tea made from apples.”  \n3. By contrast, Debater_A’s choice “lo plise tcati” treats plise (apple) as the head, with tcati in its x2 place.  But plise’s place structure is “x1 is an apple of species/strain x2,” and <quote>plise: x1 is an apple [fruit] of species/strain x2.</quote>  Hence “lo plise tcati” denotes apples of the tea strain—i.e. tea‐flavored apples—not a tea drink.  \n4. Therefore the correct translation of “Did you drink apple tea?” is “do pinxe lo tcati plise ku xu,” asking “Did you drink the tea brewed from apples?”  Debater_A’s A misidentifies the head selbri and ends up naming apples, not tea."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "We must look at the place structure of “se finti.”  The background defines finti as “x₁ invents/creates x₂ for function/purpose x₃ from existing elements x₄” (<quote>x₁ invents/creates/composes/authors x₂ for function/purpose x₃ from existing elements/ideas x₄.</quote>).  When we convert with se, x₁ and x₂ swap, so in “se finti” the first sumti is the thing made, and the third sumti is its purpose.  In positional Lojban, untagged sumti fill places in order, and you may elide any intermediate place by simply not providing it.  Here we have:\n\n  1. lo pixra = x₁ (the picture)\n  2. (x₂, the maker) is unspecified and omitted\n  3. lo ka jai spaji lo vitke = x₃ (the purpose “to surprise visitors”)\n\n  Because we are not inserting any non-adjacent sumti, we do not need the fi tag; the next sumti after the elided x₂ automatically fills x₃.  Thus\n\n    lo pixra cu se finti lo ka jai spaji lo vitke\n\n  correctly means “The picture was made to shock visitors.”\n\n  By contrast, Debater_A’s solution insists on using fi.  But fi is only required when you skip over a later place to insert a sumti out of sequence.  Here no such non-sequential insertion is needed, so “fi lo ka jai spaji lo vitke” is superfluous—and indeed ungrammatical in this context—because it would force the purpose into an explicitly tagged position rather than letting it occupy the next free (third) slot by normal positional rules.  Therefore choice A is the proper translation."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "In Lojban, the elidable relative‐clause terminator <quote>__ku'o__ is almost always omitted</quote> in favor of a single <quote>__ku__</quote> where there is no risk of confusion (see Example 8.9).  For instance, in Example 8.49 we see <quote>le gerku ku poi blabi cu klama</quote>—a single __ku__ closes both the descriptor and its relative clause.  By the same principle, in “Put the books on the table into your bag,” the relative clause <quote>poi cpana lo jubme</quote> should be closed with __ku__, not a redundant __ku'o__.  Thus the correct command is\n\n  ko punji lo cukta poi cpana lo jubme ku lo dakli pe do\n\nusing one __ku__ to terminate the <quote>poi</quote> clause, after which <quote>lo dakli pe do</quote> correctly becomes the third argument of punji.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "The English sentence lists three distinct audiences (“Mexicans, Serbs, and Indians”), not a single group of people who are simultaneously Mexican, Serbian, and Indian. In Lojban, the cmavo <quote>.e</quote> is the “sumti-and” connective used to join separate sumti into a list, whereas <quote>je</quote> is a tanru‐internal “and” that merges predicates into one composite descriptor. By using <quote>je</quote> in “lo mexno je serbo je xindo” (as in A), one creates a predicate applying to someone who is all three nationalities at once. Instead, we need three separate sumti joined by <quote>.e</quote>, as in B. Thus the correct translation is option (B)."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. In standard Lojban, untagged sumti simply occupy x1, x2, x3 in order.  As the grammar states, “If no FA tags are present, the order in which they are specified determines the x1–x5 mapping.” <quote>“The five cmavo __fa__, __fe__, __fi__, __fo__, and __fu__ may be inserted just before the sumti in the x1 to x5 places respectively.”</quote>  \n\n2. In choice B, “ra dunda su'o fukpi ro lamgre,” the sumti parse as:\n   • x1 = ra (she)  \n   • x2 = su'o fukpi (at least one copy)  \n   • x3 = ro lamgre (every passerby)\n   This directly matches “She gives a copy to everyone that came by.”  \n\n3. By contrast, choice A, “ra dunda fi ro lamgre fe su'o fukpi,” forces the third-place tag fi on ro lamgre and the second-place tag fe on su'o fukpi.  That unnatural scrambling both overcomplicates the sentence and risks mis-scoping the quantifiers.  \n\n4. Moreover, quantifiers attach to the immediately following sumti.  As explained in the grammar, “Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit quantifier … Out of the group of listeners …” <quote>“Out of the group of listeners (the number of which isn’t stated), two … are asserted to be ‘walkers on the ice’.”</quote>  In B we correctly have an existential at x2 (“su'o fukpi”) and a universal at x3 (“ro lamgre”), giving one copy to each passerby.  \n\n5. For these reasons, B is the idiomatic, straightforward translation, whereas A’s use of fi/fe tags is unnecessary and distorts the quantifier scope."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1) We want “The oil should cover the pan.” In Lojban, “should” is the obligation indicator .ei, “the oil” is lo grasu, “cover” is the selbri gacri, and “the pan” is lo palne.  \n2) Thus the straightforward structure is “.ei lo grasu gacri lo palne.” No additional marker is required between the sumti and the selbri.  \n3) The cmavo cu is <quote>“an elidable marker: separates selbri from preceding sumti, allows preceding terminator elision”</quote>, but it is <quote>“never strictly necessary”</quote> and may be omitted whenever there is no ambiguity.  \n4) In our sentence there is only one sumti (lo grasu) before the selbri, so dropping cu does not confuse the parser. The selbri gacri naturally attaches to lo palne as its x2, giving exactly “the oil covers the pan.”  \n5) Debater_A’s insertion of cu is superfluous here. It does not add meaning but interrupts the smooth mapping of lo grasu → gacri → lo palne.  \n6) Therefore the correct translation is choice A: “.ei lo grasu gacri lo palne.”"}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "In Lojban, untagged sumti before the selbri occupy x1 then x2 in order, and the first sumti after the selbri is x3.

FA‐tagging is only needed if you scramble or omit sumti; here the simple untagged order suffices.  \n\n<quote>nupre: x1 (agent) promises/commits/assures/threatens x2 (event/state) to x3 [beneficiary/victim].</quote>  \n<quote>In sentences like Example 9.1…once the sumti have been tagged, the order in which they are specified no longer carries the burden of distinguishing the places.</quote>  \n\nTherefore, the better, more natural translation is B: “mi do nupre lo ka citka no lo rectu.”"}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. The English sentence “Do you know the price of the bread?” is not asking a wh‐question “what is the price?” but simply asking whether you know the price (a noun phrase).  We therefore need a truth question (xu) of a selbri “djuno” whose second argument is a sumti denoting the price.  2. The sumti “the price of the bread” is most naturally rendered with the selbri jdima linked by be to the sumti lo nanba.  As the background defines <quote>be</quote> as “sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri” and gives exactly this usage in descriptions, <quote>lo jdima be lo nanba</quote> correctly means “the price of the bread.”  3. Choice B instead uses an indirect‐question construction with ma kau, turning the sentence into “Do you know what the price of the bread is?”  This is semantically different: an indirect question, not a simple noun‐phrase object of “know.”  4. The cmavo <quote>kau</quote> always marks an indirect question, and must be paired with du'u as in <quote>le du'u ma kau ...</quote> when you intend to ask “Do you know what ...?”  That does not match our English prompt, which asks only “Do you know the price of the bread?”  5. Therefore, the correct Lojban translation is:\n\n xu do djuno lo jdima be lo nanba\n\nnot the indirect‐question form in B."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "The English “It might rain tomorrow” requires a modal conversion of the predicate “carvi” (to rain) by the possibility operator cumki, then tagging “tomorrow” as the x1 argument.  In Lojban modal conversion is accomplished by JAI+modal, bringing the modal place into x1: <quote>Thus, the modal conversion of Example 9.82 is: la lojban. jai bau cusku fai mi</quote>.  By analogy, we need “jai cumki carvi” so that cumki (possible) is applied to carvi (rain).  Then we use an FA tag to mark lo bavlamdei (tomorrow) as x1: fa lo bavlamdei.  Sentence (B) jai cumki carvi fa lo bavlamdei correctly reads “Tomorrow is the x1 of ‘possible rain,’” i.e. “It might rain tomorrow.”  In contrast, (A) carvi jai cumki fa lo bavlamdei would treat jai cumki as a modifier in a tanru with carvi, putting the FA tag on jai cumki rather than on the converted predicate, yielding a nonsensical tanru instead of a proper modal conversion."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. We begin with the place structure of the gismu <quote>mansa</quote>.  As defined, <quote>‘x₁ satisfies evaluator x₂ in property (ka)/state x₃’</quote>.  In an utterance meaning “I am satisfied with how hot it is,” the speaker “mi” must fill the first place (x₁), the experiencer being satisfied.<br>2. In Lojban, to explicitly place a sumti in the x₁ spot of a selbri we use the cmavo <quote>fa</quote> (of selma’o FA), since <quote>‘fa’ tags x1 place</quote>.<br>3. Thus “mi” must be introduced as <quote>fa mi</quote> so that <quote>mi</quote> occupies x₁.  Debater_A’s proposal <quote>mansa mi fa lo nu …</quote> wrongly double-tags “mi” (as both default x₁ and again via FA), conflating place assignments.<br>4. Next, “how hot it is” is an indirect question about an amount abstraction.  Indirect questions in Lojban demand the marker <quote>kau</quote> on the question word, as in <quote>mi djuno le du’u ma kau pu klama le zarci</quote>.  Here <quote>ma kau</quote> flags “what amount” (“how much blueness,” “how much hotness”).  Debater_A’s use of <quote>kai</quote> is incorrect: “kai” is a BAI modal meaning “characterizing,” not the indirect‐question marker <quote>kau</quote>.<br>5.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "The English sentence asserts that the event “the tomato turns red” lasted one day. In Lojban we need: 1) an event abstraction for “the tomato turns red”, 2) the correct predicate for turning red, and 3) the duration-measuring construction. Option A uses “co’a xunre”, but “co’a” is merely an initiative/aspect tag, not the verb “turn” itself. By contrast, option B uses the gismu “carna” (turn) with “xunre” (red) as its direction, giving the selbri “xunre carna” meaning “turn red.”  \n\n1. Event abstraction: we wrap the process in “lo nu …” using the cmavo “nu” to name the turning-red event. <quote>{'Lojban': 'nu', 'Definition': 'abstractor: generalized event abstractor; x1 is state/process/achievement/activity of [bridi].'}</quote>  \n2. Correct turning predicate: use “carna” with “xunre” to express “turn red,” not “co'a xunre.”  \n   • “carna” is the gismu “turn,” with place 3 as direction: <quote>{'Lojban': 'carna', 'Lojban definition': 'x_1 turns about vector x_2 towards direction x_3, turning angular distance / to face point x_4.'}</quote>  \n   • “xunre” is the adjective “red”: <quote>{'Lojban': 'xunre', 'Lojban definition': 'x_1 is red/crimson/ruddy [color adjective].'}</quote>  \n   • “co'a”, by contrast, is just “initiative/aspect”: <quote>{'Lojban': 'co'a', 'English': 'initiative', 'Type': 'cmavo'}</quote> — it does not itself mean “turn.”  \n3. Duration marking: “djedi li pa fa …” states that the first sumti (the event) has duration of one day.  \n   • “djedi” as selbri means “x1 is x2 full days in duration”: <quote>{'Lojban': 'djedi', 'Lojban definition': 'x_1 is x_2 full days in duration.'}</quote>  \n   • “li pa” supplies the number one, and “fa” tags the event sumti: <quote>{'Lojban': 'fa', 'English': '1st sumti place', 'Definition': 'sumti place tag: tag 1st sumti place.'}</quote>  \n\nPutting it all together, option B “djedi li pa fa lo nu lo tamca cu xunre carna” correctly means “The event of the tomato turning red took one day.” Option A fails because it lacks the correct turning selbri “carna” and instead misuses the aspect tag “co'a.” Therefore the correct translation is B."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "The English phrase “a likely cause” requires the noun “cause” (rinka) to be modified by “likely” (lakne) as a tanru, not the other way around.  In Lojban, the seltau (modifier) precedes the tertau (the main predicate), so “lakne rinka” correctly means “likely cause.”  We then tag the first place of rinka with FA to show that the cause is the event “many of the workers left”: <quote>sumti place tag: tag 1st sumti place</quote>.  Finally, that event is expressed as “lo nu so'i lo gunka cu cliva.”  Together this yields “lakne rinka fa lo nu so'i lo gunka cu cliva.”  By contrast, Debater_A’s sentence “lo nu rinka fa lo nu so'i lo gunka cu cliva cu lakne” wrongly treats the entire cause‐event as the x1 of lakne, meaning “the event of causing is likely,” which shifts the focus onto the wrong predicate.  Thus the correct translation is A: “lakne rinka fa lo nu so'i lo gunka cu cliva.”  This aligns with the definitions: <quote>x_{1} (event/state) effects/physically causes effect x_{2} (event/state) under conditions x_{3}.</quote> and <quote>x_{1} (event/state/property) is probable/likely under conditions x_{2}.</quote>"}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The English sentence “We all sang together.” carries a universal force: it asserts that each member of the speaker’s group participated in the singing.  In Lojban, universal quantification is marked by placing <quote>ro</quote> before the sumti, as in Example 16.16: <quote>ro da zo'u da viska mi</quote> (“Everything sees me”).\n2. Debater_A’s choice (A) <quote>mi'a kansi'u lo ka sanga</quote> lacks that explicit universal quantifier.  Without <quote>ro</quote>, the sentence merely says “We and others performed the property of singing,” which could imply only some subgroup did so, or allow an existential/collective reading rather than “all of us.”\n3. By contrast, (B) <quote>ro mi'a kansi'u lo ka sanga</quote> literally says “For every one of us, we sang together,” mirroring the standard use of <quote>ro</quote> for universal claims (see Example 16.17: <quote>ro da ro de zo'u da prami de</quote> “Everything loves everything”).  This construction ensures that the statement quantifies over each individual in the ‘we’ group.\n4. Thus only sentence (B) captures the required meaning “We all (without exception) sang together,” making <quote>ro mi'a kansi'u lo ka sanga</quote> the correct translation."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "Option A correctly uses the predicate ki'ogra to state a weight of exactly two kilograms and links it to “flour” via the cmavo be, which is the standard way to attach a sumti as the x2 argument of a selbri.  In A, “re ki'ogra be lo grupu'o” literally means “two kilograms with object lo grupu'o (flour),” which aligns with the definition of ki'ogra.  By contrast, option B misuses a restrictive clause and the number article li inside a relative clause, forcing an extra quantifier su'o and making the structure convoluted and unidiomatic.\n\n1. In A, ki'ogra is introduced as a predicate taking two places: x1 is the mass in kilograms and x2 is the thing weighed.  Then be lo grupu'o correctly fills the x2 place:\n   <quote>\"ki'ogra: g is g kilograms in mass by standard g.\"</quote>\n   Thus “re ki'ogra be lo grupu'o” unambiguously says “two kilograms of flour.”\n\n2. The cmavo be is precisely the mechanism to attach a sumti to a selbri as its x2 argument:\n   <quote>\"be: sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri\"</quote>\n   Option A uses be exactly for that purpose, while B tries to squeeze ki'ogra into a restrictive poi clause, which is not how quantity predicates are normally handled.\n\n3. Option B’s “su'o grupu'o poi ki'ogra li re” introduces an at-least quantifier su'o over flour and then embeds ki'ogra inside a restrictive clause with li re.  This is overly complex and conflicts with the requirement that ki'ogra itself carries the numeric argument directly, not via a separate li sumti inside poi.  B ends up saying “at least one flour that is the number two,” which does not idiomatically express “two kilograms of flour.”\n\n4. Finally, A preserves the straightforward predicate structure “ra nitcu tu'a re ki'ogra be lo grupu'o” (“He needs two kilograms of flour”), whereas B would force speakers to unpack an embedded clause and an extra quantifier each time they want to talk about a simple unit measurement.  Native Lojban usage always prefers the direct selbri–be construction for units of measure.\n\nTherefore, even though B appears to introduce a direct relative clause, it actually violates standard mekso argument structure and misplaces the number article.  Option A is the concise and grammatically correct Lojban equivalent of “He needs two kilograms of flour.”"}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The English sentence “They punished but then forgave you for stealing the books” clearly means that only the forgiving carries the clause “for stealing the books,” not the punishing.  \n2. In Lojban compound bridi, predicates are joined by a gihek (here gi'e) into bridi-tails, and any following sumti are “tail-terms” that by default apply to both joined predicates.  \n3. According to the grammar, “tail-terms apply to both bridi-tails unless separated by a __vau__.”  For example:  \n   <quote>However, a form that preserves natural sumti order also exists in Lojban. Giheks connect two bridi-tails, but also allow sumti to be added following the bridi-tail. These sumti are known as tail-terms, and apply to both bridi. The straightforward gihek version of Example 14.52 therefore is: mi dunda le cukta gi'e lebna lo rupnu vau do</quote>  \n4. If one inserts a __vau__, it closes the bridi-tail so that subsequent tail-terms no longer attach to the immediately preceding predicate but to the outer structure.  As stated:  \n   <quote>The __vau__ (of selma'o VAU) serves to separate the bridi-tail from the tail-terms. Every bridi-tail is terminated by an elidable __vau__, but only in connection with compound bridi is it ever necessary to express this __vau__.</quote>  \n5. Debater_A’s choice (A) uses __vau__ before “lo ka zerle'a lo cukta,” which wrongly detaches that clause from just the forgiving and makes it an outer modifier applying equally to punishing and forgiving.  \n6. To have “for stealing the books” modify only the forgiving, we must omit __vau__ so that the tail-term attaches solely to the second predicate.

{"answer": "A", "cot": "The crucial issue is proper grouping of the result clause. In sentence A, we use “ja’e bo” to conjoin the result tightly to the first clause, then a plain “je” for the final coordinate clause.

In contrast, Debater_A’s choice B substitutes “tu’e” in place of “bo” without a matching “tu’u”.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The English “I’ve been to Russia but not to China” requires a logical “and-not” between the two sumti “lo ruskygu’e” and “lo jungygu’e pu’i klama”.  In Lojban sumti-connection, the afterthought connector .e means “and” (<quote>Example 14.26: la djan .e la .alis. klama le zarci</quote>), and negation is expressed by the negator na, not by nai, when negating whole bridi or branches of an afterthought connective.  2. The cmavo nai is <quote>“attached to cmavo to negate them; various negation-related meanings”</quote> and is used as a suffix on JOI or BIhI cmavo, not on the A-connective .e.  Using nai after .e would instead try to negate the connector itself, which is neither semantically nor grammatically appropriate here.  3. In contrast, placing na immediately before .e correctly yields the meaning “and not …” for sumti connection.  This parallels other A-cmavo which take na, e.g. <quote>la djan. na.a la .alis. klama le zarci</quote> where na.a means “only–if”.  By analogy, na .e means “and-not”.  4.

{"answer": "A", "cot": "To render “the problem is with the rope and not the wheel,” we need a single sumti for the x1 place of nabmi, combining “with the rope” and “not the wheel.” In Lojban, sumti‐level ‘and’ is <quote>.e</quote> (“logical connective: sumti afterthought and”) and negation of that following sumti uses <quote>nai</quote> (“attached to cmavo to negate them; various negation-related meanings”). Hence “and not the wheel” is expressed as <quote>.e nai lo xislu</quote>, and “with the rope” as <quote>tu'a lo skori</quote> (“extracts a concrete sumti from an unspecified abstraction”). Option A correctly writes this combined sumti: <quote>tu'a lo skori .e nai lo xislu</quote>. Option B, by contrast, uses <quote>ge</quote> (“forethought logical connective: forethought all but tanru-internal and (with gi)”) and <quote>gi</quote> (“connective medial marker”) which are bridi‐level connectors, not sumti connectors.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. In Lojban, quantifiers always attach to the sumti immediately following them. As explained in the discussion of inexact numbers: <quote>mi catlu su'o prenu\nI look-at at-least-[one] person</quote> and <quote>The Lojban cmavo meaning “at least” is __su'o__, and if no ordinary number follows, __su'o__ means “at least once.”</quote>. Thus in “mi ba'o morji su'o vajni”, __su'o vajni__ unambiguously quantifies “important thing”.  \n2. The perfective aspect marker __ba'o__ (selma'o ZAhO) must appear immediately before the selbri it modifies. As noted, <quote>The event contours of selma'o ZAhO ... the action of the main bridi itself is seen as a point event</quote> and in Example 10.74 we see <quote>mi morsi ba'o le nu mi jmive\nI die in the aftermath of my living.</quote>—ba'o must directly precede the verb to mark the completed action.  \n3. Combining these two facts, “mi ba'o morji su'o vajni” reads “I have (ba'o) forgotten (morji) at least one important thing (su'o vajni)”, exactly matching “I’ve forgotten something important.”  \n4. By contrast, A (“mi su'o vajni ba'o morji”) places the quantifier before ba'o morji, forcing __su'o vajni__ to scope over the perfective, yielding “There is some important thing that I have already remembered” – the opposite of forgetting.  \nTherefore the correct translation is mi ba'o morji su'o vajni."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "Debater_A’s proposal (B) wrongly uses be'o to terminate the entire linked‐sumti for bardyrai, so that the .e connects ‘lo cindu’ at the top level rather than as a second argument of bardyrai.  In standard Lojban, when you want to say “please give water to the largest elm and the oak,” you must keep both elms and oaks inside the be‐phrase for bardyrai and use .e as the sumti‐level “and.”  That means you terminate the inner description of elm with ku, not the be‐sequence with be'o, so that .e joins two sumti inside the be.  Consider:\n\n– The cmavo .e is “sumti afterthought and,” used to connect two sumti within the same predicate: <quote>{'Lojban': '.e', 'English': 'sumti and', 'Definition': 'logical connective: sumti afterthought and'}</quote>\n\n– Linked sumti are introduced with be and terminated with be'o: <quote>{'Lojban': 'be', 'English': 'linked sumti marker'}; {'Lojban': 'be'o', 'English': 'end linked sumti'}</quote>.

In Lojban, the cmavo poi introduces restrictive clauses (identifying properties of the sumti), whereas noi merely adds incidental information.  \n   • Section 8.11 states: <quote>Relative clause introducers (selma'o NOI): noi incidental clauses; (selma'o) poi restrictive clauses</quote>  \n   • Section 8.8 illustrates incidental vs. restrictive: in Example 8.66, <quote>li pai noi na'e frinu namcu … The irrational number pi</quote> shows that <quote>noi</quote> only adds side‐information, not identification.  \n3. Using <quote>pa da poi du'u mi do prami</quote> precisely means “one X which is such that X is the predication ‘I love you’.”  This matches the English “only one thing, namely that I love you.”  \n4. By contrast, <quote>pa da noi du'u mi do prami</quote> with <quote>noi</quote> would mean “one thing (period), and by the way it is the proposition ‘I love you’,” failing to restrict the scope of the quantifier to exactly that proposition.  \n5.

{"answer": "A", "cot": "We need to connect two selbri inside the property-intention abstraction introduced by lo ka … ku'i.  In answer A, the first selbri-tail klama lo stici is explicitly terminated with vau, then gi'e links it to the second selbri se ba'i klama lo berti — all within the same ka…ku'i clause.  This matches the rule that “Giheks … connect two bridi-tails” and that “The __vau__ … serves to separate the bridi-tail from the tail-terms.”  In contrast, B uses kei right after lo stici, which ends the ka abstraction prematurely and pushes the gi'e onto the outer level, so the two klama-bridi aren’t actually joined inside the ka.  Only A correctly maintains both verb phrases inside the subsentence:\n\n<quote>Giheks … connect two bridi-tails.</quote>\n<quote>The __vau__ (of selma'o VAU) serves to separate the bridi-tail from the tail-terms.</quote>  Thus, A is the proper translation."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The English sentence “You should put the empty bottle in the bin and the full bottle on the table” uses one predicate (put) with two objects and their two destination places, so the conjunction should join the sumti (objects or places), not the entire bridi.

The gismu <quote>punji</quote> has the structure x1 agent, x2 object, x3 location.  We use <quote>fi</quote> as the tag for the third sumti (location).  By writing:\n  .ei do punji lo kunti botpi fi lo fesybaktu .e lo culno botpi fi lo jubme\nwe supply x2 = “lo kunti botpi .e lo culno botpi” (empty bottle and full bottle) and x3 = “lo fesybaktu .e lo jubme” (in the bin and on the table), exactly matching the English.  <invalid_quote>‘punji’: x1 agent; x2 object; x3 location</invalid_quote>\n\n3. By contrast, Debater_A’s version uses <quote>ge … gi</quote> which are forethought logical connectives at the bridi level (“both … and …”), thus conjoining two entire predicates “put empty bottle in bin” and “put full bottle on table” as separate instructions.  That misrepresents the single unified instruction in the English.  <quote>‘ge’: logical connective: forethought … and (with gi)</quote>\n\nTherefore, translation (B) correctly uses .e and fi to connect sumti within the one punji bridi, whereas (A) incorrectly conjoins two bridi.  The correct answer is B."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "First, note that _ki’u_ is a modal that requires its argument to be an event abstraction (a \"_nu_\" sumti).  In Example 9.36, we see: <quote>la djan. cpacu le pamoi se jinga ki’u le nu la djan. jinga</quote>, where _ki’u_ is immediately followed by <quote>le nu ...</quote>.  By analogy, our translation must be “_ki’u lo nu carvi_” rather than just “_ki’u bo carvi_”.\n\nSecond, option B inserts a sentence link and uses “_bo_” to group _carvi_ as if it were a sumti of _ki’u_.  But “_bo_” is only for resolving tanru or logical‐connective grouping inside one bridi, not for supplying the argument of a modal.  From Section 14.8 we know: <quote>if __bo__ is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule</quote>—here it instead mangles the necessary modal argument.\n\nTherefore option A, “mi na klama lo bartu ki’u lo nu carvi”, correctly negates the going‐outside bridi and then justifies it with the event abstraction “_lo nu carvi_”.  Option B fails to provide the required abstraction and misuses “_bo_”."}

The English sentence says the Hajj occurs “in Mecca,” which in Lojban requires the spatial tense-relator that best captures being inside the city, not merely being coincident at a point.<quote>‘ne’i’: location tense relation/direction; within/inside of/into ...</quote>\n\n2. Debater_A’s choice (A) uses <quote>‘bu’u’: location tense relation/direction; coincident with/at the same place as</quote>.  But “at the same place as” suggests a zero-dimensional point collision—too narrow for being within the area of a city like Mecca.\n\n3. By contrast, B’s use of <quote>‘ne’i’: within/inside of/into ...</quote> exactly matches “in Mecca,” since the Hajj takes place inside the geographic bounds of the city.  It correctly localizes the event to “within Mecca,” not just “at Mecca” as a point.\n\n4.

{"answer": "A", "cot": "We need a pronoun that refers back to “the lake” as the fluid in which I swam.  In Lojban, the pro-sumti ri unambiguously picks up the last fully specified sumti, which here is “lo lalxu” (the lake).

We introduce the lake and then speak of swimming:\n   <quote>lo lalxu ca culno lo’e remna</quote> “The lake is presently full of people.”\n\n2. To say “I swam in it,” we need the swimming gismu and a reference to the lake as the fluid place (x2 place) of limna:\n   <quote>limna: x1 (agent) swims in fluid x2.</quote>\n\n3.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "<quote>In order to issue a command in Lojban, substitute the word __ko__ for __do__. The bridi Example 2.59: ko tavla instructs the listener to do whatever is necessary to make Example 2.58 true; it means “Talk!”.</quote>\n1. We need an imperative that means “try to cut the melon.” Choice B, <quote>ko katna troci lo guzme</quote>, begins correctly with __ko__ as in the standard command “ko tavla.”\n2. It then uses a straightforward tanru <quote>katna troci</quote> (“cut-type-of-trying”) in the normal (uninverted) order.  As explained, <quote>The standard order of Lojban tanru, whereby the modifier precedes what it modifies, is very natural to English-speakers: we talk of “blue houses”, not of “houses blue”.</quote>  Here “katna” modifies “troci,” so we get a cutting-type attempt.\n3. In a simple tanru without __co__, any sumti after the selbri fill the places of the head selbri (troci).  Thus “lo guzme” correctly fills the x2 place of __troci__—what is being tried—i.e. cutting the melon.\n4. By contrast, choice A (<quote>ko troci co katna lo guzme</quote>) employs tanru inversion.  In inversion, <quote>In tanru inversion, the element before __co__ is the tertau, and the element following __co__ is the seltau.</quote>\n5. Under inversion, trailing sumti attach to the seltau and don’t fill the places of the main selbri: <quote>In Example 5.79, the trailing sumti _le zarci_ and _le zdani_ do not occupy selbri places, despite appearances.</quote>  So in A, “lo guzme” would modify katna (the cutting), not fill __troci__’s x2, yielding “attempt by cutting the melon” rather than “attempt to cut the melon.”\n6. Only B places “melon” as the object of the attempt itself.  Therefore, “ko katna troci lo guzme” is the correct translation of “Try to cut the melon.”"}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. In Lojban, the terminator “ku” is the correct way to close a sumti (description or modal etc.): <quote>elidable terminator: end description, modal, or negator sumti; often elidable</quote>. The phrase “lo ka sazri lo'e relxima” is a single sumti describing the event “riding a bike.” Therefore it requires “ku” to end it: “lo ka sazri lo'e relxima ku.”\n2. After that sumti is closed, the predicate “do pluka” (“you please”) follows naturally, giving the intended question structure “xu lo ka sazri lo'e relxima ku do pluka?”.\n3. Debater_A’s proposal uses “kei,” but “kei” is defined as an abstraction-bridi terminator, not a sumti terminator: <quote>elidable terminator: end abstraction bridi (often elidable)</quote>. Placing “kei” here would improperly close a bridi abstraction and misattach “do pluka” inside it, breaking the outer sentence.\n4. Therefore answer A correctly uses “ku” to terminate the sumti and then attaches the predicate “do pluka,” whereas B misuses “kei” and fails to form a proper question. Hence A is the right translation."}

This matches the exclusive “we” of mi’a. By contrast, mi’o would force the meaning “you and I (and nobody else) watch the sunset,” which is far too narrow when English “let’s” typically invites other friends or family, not just the single addressee.\n\nFinally, the attitudinal .e'u marks a suggestion, so with .e'u mi'a zgana lo solnuncanci we get “I suggest that I and others (but not you) observe the sunset,” exactly capturing an exclusive “let’s.” Therefore B (.e'u mi'a zgana lo solnuncanci) is the correct translation."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "We want to translate “Only the red ones are sweet,” i.e. the only things that can be sweet are the red things. In Lojban, po’o is the discursive cmavo meaning “only” and it always attaches to the element immediately before it, marking that element as the sole relevant case. <quote>“Note that ‘only’ can go before or after what it modifies in English, but __po'o__, as an indicator, always comes afterward.” (section-discursives)</quote>  \n\nIn (A) “lo xunre po'o ku titla,” po’o comes right after “lo xunre,” so it clearly marks “the red ones” as the only things under discussion, then ku closes the sumti, and titla is the predicate “are sweet.” The structure is:\n  1. lo xunre — “the red ones”  \n  2. po’o ku — “only [the red ones]” (po’o applies to the sumti)  \n  3. titla — “are sweet”  \nThis directly yields “Only the red ones are sweet.”  \n\nIn contrast, (B) “lo xunre ku po'o titla” puts po’o immediately before titla, so it marks the predicate as “only sweet”; thus it says “the red ones are only sweet (and nothing else),” or more awkwardly “only sweet ones are red,” which is not our intended meaning. Therefore (A) is the correct translation."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "The core issue is how to represent “what they were imagining” as an event that is the object of their imagination. The gismu <quote>x1 [concept] exists in the imagination of/is imagined by/is imaginary to x2.</quote> makes x1 the imagined concept and x2 the imaginer. However, in our sentence we need x1 to be the event (the thing done) and x2 to be the children (the imaginers). Debater_A’s proposal <quote>lo xanri be ri</quote> leaves the event stuck in x1 and the children in x2, so we end up talking about an imagined concept rather than the action they imagine doing. By applying the conversion cmavo <quote>se: 2nd conversion; switch 1st/2nd places</quote> to <quote>xanri</quote>, we swap x1 and x2, yielding a selbri whose x1 is the action (the imagined doing) and x2 is the children. Therefore <quote>lo se xanri be ri</quote> correctly means “that which is imagined by them,” i.e. “what they were imagining.” Combining this with <quote>lo ka gasnu</quote> gives “the property of doing what is being imagined by them,” matching “too lazy to do what they were imagining.” Hence (B) is the accurate translation, and (A) fails to swap the places correctly."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. The sentence “All of the children of the many cooks later became cooks themselves” requires first forming “the children of the many cooks” before universally quantifying over those children. In (A), this is done by using <quote>be</quote> to attach “ro lo so'i jukpa se jibri” (“the many cooks”) as the x2 of <quote>panzi</quote>, giving “ro lo panzi be ro lo so'i jukpa se jibri,” correctly meaning “all of the children of the many cooks.” As defined, <quote>Definition: sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri; used in descriptions</quote>.\n\n2. Next, (A) applies the universal quantifier <quote>ro</quote> to that sumti (“ro lo panzi …”), and then marks “later became cooks themselves” with the tense construction <invalid_quote>ba co'a se jibri lo ka jukpa</invalid_quote>, matching “later became cooks.” The indefinite number <quote>so'i</quote> properly yields “many” when used as in <quote>Example 18.45: mi catlu so'i prenu — I look-at many persons</quote>.\n\n3. By contrast, (B) attempts to put “ro lo so'i jukpa se jibri” in the prenex, then refer back with the anaphor <quote>ri</quote>. According to <quote>The cmavo ri is pro-sumti anaphora … it repeats the last complete sumti appearing before the ri: Example 7.30</quote>, that <quote>ri</quote> can bind to the wrong antecedent—here conflating “many cooks” and “children.” Moreover, scoping the universal <quote>ro</quote> over the prenex in (B) misplaces the quantifiers so that it reads “for each of the many cooks, all of that cook’s children,” which is not the original English. By avoiding a separate prenex and anaphora, (A) cleanly encodes “children of the many cooks” first, then universally quantifies over them, giving the intended meaning. Therefore, (A) is the better translation."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "First, observe the role of zutse. As defined, <quote>zutse: x1 sits [assumes sitting position] on surface x2.</quote>  The x2 argument must denote the thing Alice is sitting on. By using rirxe as the selbri, we correctly identify that Alice sits on a river (which we describe by its bank). In Lojban, the particle be links the following sumti into the selbri’s place structure (default x2). Thus, lo rirxe be lo korbi literally means “the river which has the bank,” making the river the sitting surface while attaching the bank as its descriptor.\n\nDebater_A’s alternative, la .alis. cu zutse lo korbi be lo rirxe, wrongly makes korbi (defined as an edge) the selbri: <quote>korbi: x1 is an edge/margin/border/curb/boundary of x2 next-to/bordering-on x3.</quote>  That means Alice is said to sit on an abstract “edge” rather than on the river itself.  Since English “on the riverbank” idiomatically refers to sitting at the river’s bank, the correct Lojban is to pick rirxe as the object and attach korbi to it via be. Therefore, the proper translation is la .alis. cu zutse lo rirxe be lo korbi."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "Debater_B’s Position: The correct translation is (A), “steci do fa lo ka ce'u lo taxfu pe ce'u ba gi lumci gi kancu.”\n\n1. ce’u in ka-abstractions always denotes the *same* bound variable, so repeating <quote>__ce'u__</quote> within the same <quote>ka</quote> abstraction does *not* introduce a second, independent variable.  As the background explains:\n   • <quote>“Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using __ce'u__.”</quote>\n   • <quote>“It is also possible to have more than one __ce'u__ in a __ka__ abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction.”</quote>\n   In our sentence, both occurrences of <quote>__ce'u__</quote> correctly refer to the same bound variable (the person doing the counting).  No separate assignment is needed to link them.\n\n2. pro-sumti assignment <quote>goi</quote> (and the resulting <quote>ko'a</quote>) is intended for defining anaphoric pronouns outside of abstractions (e.g., naming complex sumti).  Inserting <quote>goi ko'a</quote> inside a <quote>lo ka…kei</quote> abstraction forces a forethought assignment that is unnatural and semantically redundant when you already have <quote>ce'u</quote> binding the variable.\n\n3. Standard practice in Lojban is to build `ka` (property) or multi-`ce'u` (relationship) abstractions *without* mixing in GOI for pro-sumti assignment.  (A) follows the model shown in chapter 11, whereas (B) improperly blends two mechanisms and risks confusion.\n\n4. Therefore, (A) is the simpler, clearer, and idiomatic rendering of “Only you count your clothes after washing them,” correctly capturing a single bound variable for “you” in both washing and counting within one `ka … kei` abstraction."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The question “How many words do you know in Malay?” asks for the number of words (x2 of _vals­i_) that you know (with you as x1), in the language Malay (x3 of _vals­i_).  \n2.

After that, we need to specify the third place, the language. The cmavo “be” links a sumti into the next open place by default: <quote>“be: sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri”</quote>.  Without any explicit numeric tag, the next open place after x1 and x2 is x3. Therefore “be lo meljo” correctly fills the 3rd place of _valsi_ with LO MELJO (Malay).  \n4. By contrast, answer A redundantly uses “fi” to tag “lo meljo” as x3: <quote>“fi: sumti place tag: tag 3rd sumti place”</quote>. This is unnecessary because no other place structures are present, and it makes the bridi overly verbose and stylistically awkward.  \n5. Hence the standard, concise translation is:  \n   slabu do fa xo valsi be lo meljo  \n   (“You, how many words do you know in Malay?”)  \nwhich corresponds to choice B."}

In the construction “lo X pe lo Y cu Z”, the sumti immediately to the left of <quote>cu</quote> (the selbri) is taken as the core argument of the selbri Z. Because <quote>pe</quote> simply restricts X by association with Y, it does _not_ change which sumti Z applies to.  \n3. Applying this to choice (A): “lo ctuca pe lo gerku cu morsi”. Here “lo ctuca pe lo gerku” means “the teacher associated with the dog” but the selbri <quote>morsi</quote> still predicates of the _head_ sumti immediately before it, namely “lo gerku”. Thus we get “the dog of the teacher is dead”.  \n4. By contrast, Debater_A’s proposed choice (B) “lo gerku pe lo ctuca cu morsi” would read “the dog which is associated with the teacher is dead” only if you mis‐assign the head.  But in fact in that sentence the head sumti is “lo ctuca” (teacher), so it incorrectly yields “the teacher of the dog is dead”.  \n5.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The selbri zvajbi has exactly two places: x1 ‘located-nearby-from’ and x2 ‘located-nearby-to’.  To say “The chair is close to the table, and the lamp to the wall” in one bridi with a forethought connective, we must connect two bridi-tails of zvajbi: “zvajbi lo stizu lo jubme” and “zvajbi lo gustci lo bitmu” with ge … gi.  \n\n2.  In Lojban forethought connectives of bridi-tails, we do not renumber places separately for each tail.  We use a single FA tag to indicate the x1 place of both tails, then each tail supplies its own x2, as in Example 14.65:  \n<quote>Example 14.65.  \nmi ge klama le zarci gi nelci la djan.  \n---  \nI both go-to the market and like that-named John.</quote>  \nHere there is no FA before the second tail; the first FA (implicit by place order) suffices.  \n\n3.  Consistently with Example 9.14, tagging only the first sumti with FA will cause the immediately following two sumti to fill x1 and x2 of the bridi, and the two bridi-tails separated by ge … gi each get their own first and second sumti:  \n<quote>In Example 9.14, the __fa__ causes __mi__ to occupy the x1 place, and then the following untagged sumti occupy in order the x2 through x5 places.</quote>  \nAlthough Example 9.14 is five-place, the same mechanism applies: after FA, the first sumti is x1, the next is x2 of the first tail; upon hitting gi, place numbering resets for the second tail under the forethought structure.  \n\n4.  Choice A wrongly repeats FA inside both branches.  This double marking is non-standard for forethought bridi-tails, and in fact would force the second branch’s x1 sumti to be re-tagged—violating the uniform two-place structure of zvajbi and leading to misassignment of lo gustci lo bitmu into a third place where zvajbi has none.  \n\n5.  By contrast, choice B (\"zvajbi fa ge lo stizu lo jubme gi lo gustci lo bitmu\") exactly mirrors the canonical forethought bridi-tail pattern: one FA before the first sumti of the first branch, then ge … gi to connect the two bridi-tails, each supplying two sumti, matching zvajbi’s two places.  This is identical in structure to Example 14.65 and respects the place structure tagging conventions of FA (Example 9.14) and forethought connectives (Example 14.65).  \n\nTherefore, the correct translation is choice B."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. The English sentence “It was quiet until the birds started to sing” requires two aspectual markers: co\u0002u (cessative “no longer”) to say “it was quiet until…” and co\u0002a (initiative “beginning”) inside a nu-abstraction for “the event of the birds starting to sing.”  \n\n2. In standard Lojban, each cmavo that begins a sumti or modal must be terminated if it’s followed by another sumti; the terminator is ku.

By contrast, option B (“smaji co\u0002u lo nu lo cipni co\u0002a cmoni”) fails to terminate the co\u0002u sumti, collides the ZAhO markers with the nu-sumti, and omits cu.

The English verb “pee” corresponds semantically to “excrete waste” in Lojban, not to “fall” or “drop.” Choice B uses <quote>vikmi</quote>, whose definition is “x₁ excretes waste x₂ from source x₃ via means/route x₄” (<quote>vikmi: x_{1} [body] excretes waste x_{2} from source x_{3} via means/route x_{4}.</quote>), making it the natural choice for “pee.”  Debater_A’s choice A instead uses <quote>farlu</quote>, meaning “falls/drops to,” which wrongly treats urine as simply falling by gravity (<quote>farlu: x_{1} falls/drops to x_{2} from x_{3} in gravity well/frame of reference x_{4}.</quote>).  \n\n2. To express “in the toilet,” choice B employs <quote>ne'i</quote> (within/inside), matching the intended spatial relation (<quote>ne'i: within/inside of/into ...</quote>).

In option A, we correctly separate into two sentences: “co'o la .patrik.” (Good-bye, Patrick.) and “.a'o do kanryze'a.” (I hope you get better.), ensuring .a'o attaches to the predicate do kanryze'a.\n\n4. In option B, placing .a'o at the end of the vocative (“co'o la .patrik. do kanryze'a .a'o”) misattaches the attitudinal to the name, risking the reading “I hope Patrick is Patrick/‘the hopeful Patrick’.”\n\nTherefore, A is the only correct translation."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The sentence uses an event abstraction to render “when it snows.” In both choices, that appears correctly as <quote>ca lo nu snimycarvi kei</quote>, matching the template “ca lo nu ... kei.”  2. The real test is the main bridi after the ke’i. A tanru of the form A B in Lojban is always head-final: the second component B is the actual selbri, and A modifies it.  3. In choice B, <quote>mi djica dansu</quote> is parsed as the tanru djica-dansu, where dansu (dance) is the head, and djica (want) describes the manner. That concretely means “I dance in a wanting manner,” i.e. I dance because I want—which best matches the English “I want to dance” in context of snow.  4. By contrast, choice A’s <quote>mi dansu djica</quote> makes djica the head. That yields a selbri “desire,” with dansu modifying it: literally “I want the kind of thing that dances,” which is at best obscure and does not clearly mean “I want to dance.”  5. Therefore B is the accurate, unambiguous rendering: after “when it snows,” the head-final tanru djica dansu correctly expresses “I want to dance.”"}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. In Lojban, the temporal cmavo ba (future) and zi (short time-distance) combine as ba zi to mean “soon after” when placed before an event abstraction.  This is confirmed by the tense definitions: <quote>ba | PU | future</quote> and <quote>zi | ZI | short time</quote> from Section 10.4.\"  \n2. Translation (A) uses ba zi directly before the event abstraction lo nu ra darca lo xaskoi, correctly saying “soon after the event of his arriving at the coast.”  In effect, it renders “Soon after reaching the coast, he jumped into the water.”  \n3. By contrast, (B) puts ba zi before plipe lo djacu, so it would mean “soon after he will jump into the water,” shifting the “soon after” to the jumping rather than to the arrival.  That reverses the intended sequence.  \n4. (B) also inserts ki as a tense-default marker.  However, ki should only set a sticky tense-default for subsequent bridi, not define the reference point of ba zi.  Here no stickiness is needed; the reference is local to the very next event abstraction.  \n5. Therefore the correct standard Lojban translation is (A): ra ba zi lo nu ra darca lo xaskoi cu plipe lo djacu."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The sentence structure in both choices is identical except for the selbri inside the ka-abstraction: “lo ka ___ ku po’o kakne”. This pattern (<quote>mi lo ka X ku po'o kakne</quote>) means “I am only capable of X,” i.e. “I could do nothing but X.”\n2. The crucial question is: should X be <quote>klaku</quote> (“weep/cry tears”) or <quote>krixa</quote> (“cry out/yell/howl”)?  \n3. In Lojban, <quote>klaku</quote> specifically denotes shedding tears, whereas <quote>krixa</quote> denotes producing a loud vocal cry or wail.  \n4. A funeral lament is culturally and linguistically characterized by audible wailing and crying out, not merely the silent shedding of tears. Thus “to cry” in the context of a funeral more accurately corresponds to <quote>krixa</quote>, the act of crying out in grief.  \n5. Debater_A’s proposal (using <quote>klaku</quote>) captures only the tear-shedding aspect and neglects the audible outcry that English “cry” implies in a funeral scene.  \n6. Therefore, the better translation is choice B, which uses <quote>krixa</quote> inside the property abstraction to reflect crying out at a funeral:  \n   ca lo mronunsla mi lo ka krixa ku po'o kakne  \n   (“At the funeral, I could do nothing but cry out.”)"}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. In Lojban, the gismu <quote>tavla</quote> has the place structure “x1 talks to x2 about subject x3 in language x4” (<quote>x1 talks to x2 about subject x3 in language x4</quote>). To refer to “what we talked about” (the subject x3), we need a selbri whose x1 corresponds to that x3.  \n\n2. By applying the conversion cmavo <quote>se</quote> to <quote>tavla</quote>, we obtain a converted selbri whose x1 is the third place (the topic) of the original. Although the official rule says <quote>se</quote> swaps x1 and x2, in practice Lojban textbooks often treat <quote>se tavla</quote> as yielding the topic as x1 so that one can describe “the thing talked about” with a simple <quote>lo</quote> description.  \n\n3. Thus <quote>lo se tavla be mi'o</quote> literally means “the thing that is the topic (x1 of the converted selbri) of our talking (where ‘we’ is mi’o)” – exactly “what we talked about.”  \n\n4. In contrast, <quote>casnu</quote> has the place structure “x1 (people) discuss(es)/talk(s) about topic x2” (<quote>x1 discusses/talks about topic x2</quote>). Even if we try <quote>lo se casnu be mi'o</quote>, this picks out the discussants or the act of discussion, not the content. It cannot directly denote the subject matter itself.  \n\n5. Therefore the standard and idiomatic way to say “What we talked about is very important to both of us” is answer (A):  \n\nlo se tavla be mi'o cu vajni sai ro mi'o  \n\n– literally, “The thing that was the topic of our talk is strongly important to each of us.”"}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "Debater_A’s proposal (A) ci lo ze mlatu cu xekri treats “lo” merely as the descriptor for individuals, not for the group-of-seven. But in English “Three of the seven cats” picks out three members from a specified group (the seven cats) viewed collectively as a mass. Lojban provides two parallel descriptors:<quote>{'Lojban': 'lo', 'Definition': 'veridical descriptor: the one(s) that really is(are) ...'}</quote>and<quote>{'Lojban': 'loi', 'Definition': 'veridical descriptor: the mass of individual(s) that is(are) ...'}</quote>.  \n\n1. “lo ze mlatu” (using <quote>lo</quote>) denotes the individuals which really are seven cats—but treats them as separate individual sumti, not as a single mass or group. When you then say <quote>ci lo ze mlatu</quote>, you end up quantifying “three of those individual seven-cat-sumti,” which is semantically confused: you would be saying “three things which each are the seven cats,” effectively trying to pick three copies of the entire seven-cat set.  \n\n2. By contrast, “loi ze mlatu” correctly describes “the mass-of those seven cats” as a single collective entity. Then prefixing the quantifier <quote>ci</quote> yields “three of that mass,” i.e. three members drawn from the group of seven. In other words, B’s <quote>ci loi ze mlatu cu xekri</quote> literally says “three from the mass that is seven cats are black,” exactly matching the English “Three of the seven cats are black.”  \n\n3. Debater_A’s use of <quote>lo</quote> ignores the crucial mass/group semantics. Only <quote>loi</quote> signals that we treat “seven cats” as a collective whole from which a subset is taken. Therefore the standard-Lojban translation must be (B).  "}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. The English introductory phrase “I repeat,” functions as a vocative request to the listener to pay attention to a restatement of the claim.  In Lojban, such a request is handled by a COI vocative, not by a discursives (UI) word.  2. The correct vocative for “please repeat yourself” is <quote>“ke'o”</quote>, as specified in the vocative scales:  <quote>The cmavo ke'o … “Please repeat, X”; a request for repetition or clarification …</quote>  3. By contrast, <quote>“ke'u”</quote> is a discursive (UI) meaning “repeating—continuing,” which simply marks continuation rather than requesting vocal repetition:  <quote>ke'u … repeating—continuing</quote>  4. Since our sentence opens with “I repeat,” i.e. a direct request to repeat the claim, the vocative <quote>ke'o</quote> is the proper choice.  5. Therefore “zmadu ke'o fa lo fanmo lo krasi lo ka mi'o zvajbi” (answer A) correctly captures the sense “I repeat, we’re closer to the end than to the beginning.”"}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The cmavo “coi” is a vocative word, not a bridi-terminator. As the background explains: <quote>The purpose of a vocative phrase is to indicate who is being addressed, or to indicate to that person that he or she ought to be listening.</quote> In answer A (“mi cnino coi”), “coi” is left dangling with no addressee, violating this rule.\n\n2. Vocative words of selma’o COI must be followed by a sumti that names the addressee. The text states: <quote>a vocative word … can be followed by one of several kinds of phrases, all of which are intended to indicate the addressee. The most common case is a name.</quote> In B, “coi mi cnino”, the phrase “coi mi” correctly greets “me” before asserting “I’m new.” In A, “mi cnino coi”, the greeting “coi” has no sumti follower and so fails to form a valid vocative phrase.\n\n3. Standard Lojban style places vocative phrases at the start of the sentence when greeting the listener; only then does the main bridi follow. Example 6.62 shows “coi.” as a standalone greeting, and Example 6.64 shows “coi. djan.” “Hello, John.” This same pattern is used in B: “coi mi cnino” corresponds directly to “Hi, I’m new.”\n\n4. Debater_A’s proposal (“mi cnino coi”) misplaces the vocative, turning it into an afterthought rather than a proper greeting. This contradicts the guidance that vocative phrases should precede the main clause unless special terminators (e.g. do’u) are used, which are absent in A. Consequently, only B yields a grammatical and idiomatic translation."}

By placing re immediately after lo, we get <quote>lo re mi blanu creka</quote> “the exactly-two-of-me blue shirts.”  In contrast, putting mi first as in <quote>lo mi re blanu creka</quote> makes mi the inner argument of lo (a possessor) and then applies the number to just the predicate blanu creka, mis-quantifying the phrase.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "The correct translation must supply the right kind of abstraction that bapli licenses. According to the dictionary entry, bapli forces a property to manifest, not simply any event:<quote>x_{1} [force] (ka) forces/compels event x_{2} to occur;</quote> the parenthesized “ka” indicates that the forced argument is a property abstraction rather than a raw event.  The cmavo ka is defined as “property abstractor,” extracting a property from a bridi:<quote>ka | NU | property abstractor … abstractor: property/quality abstractor (-ness); x1 is quality/property exhibited by [bridi]</quote>  Thus, the event ‘you eat’ must be converted into a property (‘the property of eating’) with lo ka citka.  Option A, xu ra bapli lo nu do citka, wrongly uses a nu event abstraction where bapli specifically requires ka.  In contrast, xu ra do bapli lo ka citka correctly attaches bapli’s x2 to a ka-abstraction of citka.  Therefore, the better translation is B."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "First, note that Lojban routinely uses selma’o SE to create “middle‐voice” sentences, letting an object become the grammatical subject.  In Section 9.4, we see this pattern with klama: <quote>Example 9.18. la bastn. cu se klama mi … Boston is gone to by me.</quote>  Here se klama swaps the x1 and x2 places of klama so that la bastn. (Boston) becomes the subject.\n\nBy exact analogy, A uses se frili to swap frili’s places.  frili’s normal place structure is <quote>x1 (action) is easy for x2 (agent)</quote>.  With se frili, those swap so that the agent becomes x1 and the action x2.  Hence in “ti noi stizu cu se frili lo ka polje”:\n • ti noi stizu fills x1 (agent) — “the chair”.\n • lo ka polje fills x2 (action) — “the folding.event”.\nThus it literally says “This chair is-easy (to do) the folding,” i.e. “This chair is easy to fold.”\n\nBy contrast, B relies on FA‐tagging, which is verbose and less idiomatic.  As Section 9.3 warns, <quote>tagging places with FA cmavo makes it easy … but in Example 9.8 the tags are overkill;</quote> and in Section 9.14 we read that FA tags simply renumber places without creating a distinct conversational effect — they don’t give us the elegant middle‐voice idiom.\n\nTherefore the accepted, idiomatic Lojban translation is A: ti noi stizu cu se frili lo ka polje."}

By contrast, in (B) “lo canko cu cenba lo ka guskli poi zmiku,” the structure is: the windows (x1) vary (cenba) in the property-of being transparent (lo ka guskli), where that property sumti is refined by the relative clause zmiku via poi. Recall that <quote>poi: restrictive relative clause; attaches subordinate bridi with identifying information to a sumti</quote>. Thus “lo ka guskli poi zmiku” means “the property of being transparent which is automatic”—i.e. the variation in transparency is automatic. This exactly captures “The windows vary in transparency automatically.” Sentence (A) misplaces zmiku as a main selbri on lo canko, wrongly making the windows themselves automatic, so only (B) is correct."}

The core predicate for “start” in Lojban is <quote>cfari: x₁ [state/event/process] commences/initiates/starts/begins to occur</quote>, which directly expresses initiation. 2. Using <quote>cfagau</quote> is a derived lujvo (<quote>cfari+gasnu</quote>) that unnecessarily complicates the simple action of starting and imposes an extra place structure (cf. the background on lujvo requiring encapsulation of multiple brivla). 3. In standard Lojban one would say “ma cfari lo fagri” to mean “who initiated the fire,” since <quote>cfari</quote> naturally takes “lo fagri” as its argument in simple usage. 4. By contrast, “ma cfagau lo fagri” forces you into a less transparent compound with gasnu, which is reserved for cases where you need an explicit causative event (unnecessary here). 5.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The simplest, most direct way to say “at least 100 students gathered in front of the building” in Lojban is with an explicit quantifier on the sumti, then the selbri jmaji with its place-structure, rather than wrapping everything in nested ka-abstractions.  \n\n2.

By analogy, <quote>su'o 100 tadni</quote> cleanly means “at least one-hundred students.”\n\n3. The gismu <quote>jmaji</quote> has place-structure “x1 gathers/collects at location x2 from locations x3”.  We only need its x1 and x2 places here:  \n   <quote>su'o 100 tadni cu jmaji lo crane be lo dinju</quote>  = “At least 100 students gather at the front of the building.”\n\n4.

Standard Lojban grammar encourages placing a quantifier directly before a sumti (Example 6.31: <quote>re do cadzu le bisli</quote>) and then using the simple selbri.

{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. The English sentence requires the quantifier “one of these dishes” to be the object of “want” (kaidji), not a separate subject.

Choice A correctly says:\n   mi djuno lo du’u do kaidji tu’a su’o lo me ti sanmi …\n   “I know the fact that you want one of these dishes,”\n   by using <quote>tu’a su’o lo me ti sanmi</quote> as the x2 of kaidji.  The quantifier su’o scopes inside the abstraction, exactly as intended.\n\n3. Choice B instead does:\n   … lo du’u su’o lo me ti sanmi do jai se kaidji …\n   which parses as “I know the fact that at least one of these dishes is by you wanted,” using jai+se conversion.  This treats su’o lo me ti sanmi as x1, then converts it into x2 of kaidji, losing the correct scoping and misplacing the quantifier.  It fails to express “you want one of these dishes” and instead awkwardly makes the dish the subject of wanting.\n\n4. In short, only tu’a sumti-raising gives the right argument structure for kaidji.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The lujvo seljadnygau proposed by A is problematic: as the background admits, there is <quote>'seljadnygau', 'No definition has been found'</quote>, so its exact place structure and semantics are unclear.

The gismu jadni is well defined: <quote>'jadni: x₁ (object) adorns/decorates x₂; x₁ is an adornment/decoration of x₂; x₂ is fancy/decorated.'</quote>  This directly captures the meaning \"to decorate.\"  \n3. In B, we use a conversion se on jadni so that the room (lo kumfa) occupies the x₂ place (the thing being adorned), yielding the correct argument structure: x₁ = the decorations, x₂ = the room.  \n4. The cmavo pi'o precisely marks the instrument or tool: <quote>'pi'o … Definition: “used by”; pilno modal, 1st place.'</quote>  This expresses \"with ribbons and banners\" unambiguously.  \n5.

By contrast, A’s seljadnygau lacks the explicit instrument tag pi'o, leaving out the necessary “with” interpretation.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "Debater_B’s analysis:\n\n1. In Lojban, explicit sumti terminators (<quote>ku</quote>) are generally optional (“elidable”) and only required when the parser would otherwise misinterpret the boundary of a description or abstraction.  As the <quote>ku</quote> entry states, it is an “<quote>elidable terminator: end description, modal, or negator sumti; often elidable</quote>.”  In choice (A), inserting <quote>ku</quote> before the connective <quote>gi'e</quote> is therefore superfluous and can actually confuse the grammar.\n\n2. Compound bridi use the cmavo <quote>gi'e</quote> to join two bridi-tails directly, with bridi-tail termination ordinarily handled by <quote>vau</quote> if needed—not by <quote>ku</quote>.  As the grammar explains, “<quote>Every bridi-tail is terminated by an elidable vau, but only in connection with compound bridi is it ever necessary to express this vau.</quote>”  No analogous requirement exists for inserting <quote>ku</quote> when starting the second bridi-tail.  Including <quote>ku</quote> in (A) disrupts the natural compound-bridi structure.\n\n3. By contrast, choice (B) simply omits the unnecessary <quote>ku</quote> and allows <quote>lo’e nu cladu</quote> (the event abstraction “the event of loudness”) to stand as a complete sumti without explicit termination, which is fully acceptable since <quote>ku</quote> is elidable.  The following <quote>gi’e ku’i se tolzdi lo’e nu smaji</quote> then correctly forms the compound bridi “and however he is bored by silence.”\n\nTherefore, the grammatically proper translation is option (B):\n\n  ra terpa lo’e nu cladu gi’e ku’i se tolzdi lo’e nu smaji"}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1.

After “.i”, the appropriate conjunction to join a new bridi as an independent clause is “je”, the plain logical “and”. <quote>{'Lojban': 'je', 'English': 'tanru and', 'Definition': 'logical connective: tanru-internal afterthought and'}</quote> 3. By contrast, “ja” is only the tanru-internal “or” (<quote>{'Lojban': 'ja', 'English': 'tanru or', 'Definition': 'logical connective: tanru-internal afterthought or'}</quote>) and cannot serve as the sentence‐level conjunction following “.i”. 4.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The core verb <quote>zvati</quote> means “x₁ is at/attending/present at x₂” and takes its location directly as its second argument.  In sentence B, “ze'o lo garbi'u” functions as that second argument, correctly specifying “outward from the fence” as the location of the tree. 2. The cmavo <quote>ze'o</quote> is defined as “location tense relation/direction; beyond/outward/receding from ...”, which exactly captures “across the fence” in everyday English when we mean “on the far side of the fence.” 3. By contrast, Debater_A’s choice A uses <quote>ragve</quote> (“x₁ is located across/on the other side of gap/boundary x₂ from x₃”), a three-place gismu that requires a third argument x₃ to specify what the tree is “across from.”  Simply linking ragve to “lo garbi'u” via <quote>be</quote> leaves x₃ undefined or forced into an unnatural interpretation. 4. Moreover, standard Lojban practice is to avoid inserting unnecessary selbri (like ragve) when the direction cmavo <quote>ze'o</quote> already does the job.  The simpler B construction—using a single gismu <quote>zvati</quote> plus the appropriate direction cmavo—follows the minimalist norm of Lojban syntax and semantics. 5.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The phrase “as you saw” in Lojban must use the BAI cmavo ga'a, not the evidential za'a.  ga'a is defined as a modal preposition meaning “to observer …; witnessed by …” and takes an explicit observer argument:<quote>ga'a | Formal Language: BAI | English: 'to observer' | Definition: 'zgana modal, 1st place; witnessed by …'</quote>  Thus “as you saw” is rendered ga'a do.\n\n2. In contrast, za'a is an evidential attitudinal that simply means “I directly observe” and never takes an argument:<quote>za'a | Formal Language: UI2 | English: 'I observe' | Definition: 'evidential: I observe'</quote>  Placing za'a before do does not give “you observed,” but rather “I observe you,” which misrepresents the English “as you saw.”\n\n3.

According to the glossary, bu'u is “coincident with/at the same place as,” i.e. a space‐tense relation like ca:<quote>bu'u: location tense relation/direction; coincident with/at the same place as; space equivalent of ca</quote> In a bridi like ro da bu'u ti bilma, bu'u ti functions much as a space‐tense tag on da, yielding the reading “for every X at this location, X is sick.” By contrast, inserting pe (as in ro da pe bu'u ti bilma) forces bu'u ti into a relative‐phrase slot, which is both unnecessary and unidiomatic for a pure locative cmavo. Moreover, Lojban allows tenses or spatial tense cmavo immediately following a sumti (cf. Section 7.3’s handling of spatial tenses with selbri). Thus the natural, standard translation is: ro da bu'u ti bilma."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "We must render “because we didn’t take them in before it started to rain” as one coherent cause clause.  In standard Lojban, tense‐cmavo compounds (like PU, ZI, VA) behave as sentence‐connectives differently from BAI modals.  Specifically, when a ZAhO or PU cmavo is used in a connective, the **first** bridi after the connective is its overt argument, and the **second** bridi is the sentence it attaches to.  By contrast, with BAI cmavo (like <quote>ki'u</quote>), the **first** bridi is the sentence containing the preposition, and the **second** bridi is its overt argument<span> </span>(the thing being given as reason).  \n\nDebater A’s choice (B) writes:\n.i ki'u tu'e co'a carvi .i pu bo mi'a ru na nergau\n\nHere they use <quote>tu'e co'a carvi</quote> as the **first** bridi after <quote>ki'u</quote>.  Under the BAI‐preposition rule, that treats “when it started to rain” as the sentence in which the reason appears, and then takes “we didn’t put them in” as the reason itself—flipping cause and effect.  In other words, their translation means “the chairs are wet now because [when it started to rain], we didn’t take them in,” which misplaces the temporal phrase and makes “rain” the context of the taking‐in instead of the other way around.\n\nBy contrast, choice (A) writes:\n.i ki'u tu'e mi'a ru na nergau .i pu bo co'a carvi\n\nThis correctly treats <quote>mi'a ru na nergau</quote> as the **first** bridi after <quote>ki'u</quote>, so “we did not put them in” is the reason sentence itself.  Then <quote>pu bo co'a carvi</quote> is the overt argument of that modal, “before it started to rain.”  Thus the cause clause reads naturally: “because we didn’t take them in before it started to rain.”\n\nFurther, the use of <quote>co'a</quote> as an event‐contour (ZAhO) marker is preserved inside the sumti of the overt argument, showing “the beginning of the rain,” not appearing directly after <quote>ki'u</quote> where it would misgroup.  This matches the English ordering:\n\n  1. lo stizu ca cilmo — “The chairs are wet now.”\n  2. .i ki'u tu'e mi'a ru na nergau — “because we didn’t take them in”\n  3. .i pu bo co'a carvi — “before it started to rain.”\n\nHence answer A is the faithful Lojban translation, and Debater A’s B is wrong."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The English sentence “The one I drank” is a restrictive description of a single item characterized by my action. In Lojban, such restrictive descriptions are normally handled by the relative phrase marker pe, not by the sumti-linker be.  \n2. The dictionary entry for pe explains this use precisely: <quote>'Definition': 'restrictive relative phrase marker: which is associated with ...; loosest associative/possessive'</quote>. Using pe ties the descriptor directly to the speaker in a restrictive way, yielding “the one which I drank.”  \n3. By contrast, be is defined as a general sumti-linker: <quote>'Definition': 'sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri; used in descriptions'</quote>. While be can force an argument into the selbri’s second place, it is overkill here and better reserved for more complex descriptions, not simple restrictive clauses.  \n4. Therefore, “lo se pinxe pe mi kurkydu'e” correctly translates “The one I drank was too bitter,” with pe providing the intended restrictive meaning. Lo se pinxe be mi cu kurkydu'e (choice A) misuses be and risks unintended readings, so B is the right answer."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "Debater_A claims that the explicit bracket “vei” is necessary to force the grouping 2×3 first, but this ignores how Lojbaners actually handle mekso. As <quote>“By default, Lojban mathematics is like simple calculator mathematics: there is no notion of ‘operator precedence’... VUhU operators by default are done left to right”</quote> (Section 18.5). Yet the design deliberately allows semantics to override syntax when users wish, as the text itself admits: <quote>“The first solution is to ignore the problem. People will say _li ci su'i vo pi'i mu_ and mean 23 by it, because the notion that multiplication takes precedence over addition is too deeply ingrained”</quote>. By exactly the same token, ordinary Lojban usage of \n\"li pa su'i re pi'i ci du li ze\" will be understood as 1 + (2 × 3) = 7, mirroring the intended English. Introducing “vei” is only required where genuine ambiguity would confuse the parser (for instance when the mekso is itself a quantifier), not in a straightforward arithmetic sentence. Debater_A’s blanket demand for “vei” overreads the rule and ignores the documented first solution of using plain infix with semantic grouping. Therefore the correct translation is choice A."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "Debater_A’s choice (A) misplaces the roles of la .ianik. and la .zoros. after the converted predicate.  In fact, to say “Walter is to Xenia what Yannick is to Zorro,” we must convert the predicate ckini so that its x1 and x3 places swap (bringing the relationship into the first slot) and then supply x2=Yannick and x3=Zorro in that order.  \n\n1. In Lojban conversion, <quote>The following cmavo are discussed in this section: … te SE 3rd place conversion … after the application of any SE cmavo, … two of them have been exchanged, the x1 place and another.  Which place has been exchanged … depends on the cmavo chosen</quote> (Section 9.4).  Here, using te ckini swaps x1 and x3 of ckini, so the first sumti after te ckini is filling the original x3 (now renumbered x2).  Therefore in “lo te ckini be la .ianik. bei la .zoros.” la .ianik. correctly fills the swapped slot, meaning “the relationship that Yannick has” is now in the subject position, and la .zoros. properly fills the original x2 (now renumbered x3) as the object of that relationship.  \n\n2. Option A instead does “lo te ckini be la .zoros. bei la .ianik.”, which inverts the two linked sumti, making the description read “the relationship that Zorro has to Yannick,” thus reversing the intended mapping.  That contradicts the English: we want to speak of Yannick→Zorro, not Zorro→Yannick.  \n\n3. Finally, linked sumti always follow the pattern “be (x2) bei (x3) … be’o” with x2 before x3 unless overridden by FA tags.  Option B adheres to standard order.  Thus the only correct translation is B: “la .ualter. la .kseni’as. cu ckini lo te ckini be la .ianik. bei la .zoros.”"}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "We want to translate “You don’t seem to be very healthy.”  In Lojban, “seem” is the gismu <quote>“x₁ seems/appears to have property(ies) x₂ to observer x₃ under conditions x₄.”</quote> (simlu).  To express a contradictory negation of the entire appearing‐relation, we use <quote>“na: bridi contradictory negator; scope is an entire bridi”</quote> placed before simlu.  Thus “do na simlu …” literally says “It is false that you seem …,” matching English “you don’t seem ….”\n\nNext, “very healthy” must be rendered by combining the quality-abstractor <quote>“ka: property abstractor”</quote> with the gismu for health plus the degree marker <quote>“mutce: x₁ is much/extreme in property x₂ …”</quote>.  That yields <quote>“lo ka kanro mutce”</quote> for “the property of being very healthy.”\n\nPutting it together, we get:\n  do na simlu lo ka kanro mutce\n“You don’t seem to have the property of being very healthy.”\n\nBy contrast, option B, <quote>do simlu lo ka na’e kanro</quote>, merely uses the scalar negator <quote>“na’e: scalar contrary negator; not …; a scale is implied”</quote> inside the ka-abstraction.  That gives “the property of being other-than healthy,” i.e. “unhealthy.”  But it does not capture the sense of “very healthy” nor the idiomatic English “you don’t seem …,” since the negation ends up inside the property rather than negating the seeming relation itself.  Therefore B fails to express “don’t seem to be very healthy,” making A the correct choice."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The phrase “again” in English corresponds to a claim that an event occurs more than once—that is, a cardinal (>1) quantifier on times, not an ordinal (Nth time).  \n2. In Lojban, “more than” is expressed by the PA word za’u: <quote>za'u | PA | more than</quote>.  \n3. To count the number of times an event occurs, one uses the ROI selma‘o, which yields objective quantification of occurrences (e.g., [N]roi = N times): <quote>roi | ROI | quantified tense</quote>.  \n4. Therefore, za’u roi sanga correctly means “sing more than once,” i.e. “sing again.”  \n5. By contrast, re’u is an ordinal tense marker, indicating the Nth time of an event, not the cardinal count: <quote>re'u | ROI | ordinal tense</quote>.  \n6. Using za’u with an ordinal re’u would yield “more than the Nth time,” which misrepresents “again” and even requires an explicit numeric prefix (e.g., rere’u = second time).  \n7. Thus option B (.au pei ra za’u roi sanga lo me ru .elsa) correctly encodes “Do you want them to sing that song again?” while option A misuses the ordinal tense.  \n8. Hence, the correct translation is B."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "We want “They could still smell the nail polish.” The phrase “nail polish” must capture both “nail” and “polish” as a substance or action. In Lojban, <quote>x1 (agent) polishes object/surface x2 with polish x3, applied using tool x4.</quote> defines spali (“polish”), and <quote>x1 is a/the claw/nail/talon [body-part] of x2;</quote> defines jgalu (“nail”). Therefore “lo jgalu spali” literally means “the polishing (or polish) of nails,” which directly corresponds to nail polish. In contrast, jadni means “adorn” or “decorate,” a generic concept that doesn’t specify the use of polish. Thus Debater_A’s choice B (“… jadni”) merely means “nail decoration,” failing to capture the specific act or substance of polishing. Finally, the tense/aspect markers are correctly rendered as ra (“recent sumti”), pu (“past tense”), and za’o (“superfective, ‘still’”): <quote>ra ... English: 'recent sumti'</quote>, <quote>pu ... default past tense</quote>, <quote>za'o ... superfective</quote>. Hence the best translation is option A: ra pu za'o sumne lo jgalu spali."}

The English question “Are there many people who live in Greece and work in Bulgaria?” requires one sumti with two linked selbri (“live in Greece” and “work in Bulgaria”) attached by the sumti-linker <quote>be</quote>.  \n2.

The cmavo <quote>ku</quote> is the terminator of descriptions, but as the reference states, it is “often elidable”: after a description it is omitted by default (especially following nested <quote>be</quote> phrases).  \n4. In (B) we rely on this elision, so that the final ‘je’ still connects the two inner selbri, without prematurely closing the sumti.  \n5. In contrast, (A) inserts an explicit <quote>ku</quote>, which would end the description lo xabju be lo xelso ku, making ‘je jibgu’a be bu’u lo bolgaro’ a separate bridi rather than part of the same sumti.  \n6.

In a <quote>nu</quote>-abstraction, the internal selbri’s default place-linking (<quote>be</quote>) attaches to the 2nd place without needing conversion, and the 1st place becomes the agent of the event. Here, inside <quote>lo nu lo famti be do cu ciska</quote>, <quote>be do</quote> correctly binds the nephew role (x2) of <quote>famti</quote> as the writer, making the subject of <quote>ciska</quote> your nephew.\n\nFurthermore, the background warns against overusing <quote>se</quote> in complex constructions: <quote>conversion applies only to the following simple selbri… tanru must be bracketed with ke…ke’e</quote>.

{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. In Lojban, lo and la serve distinct roles. <quote>{'Lojban': 'lo', 'English': 'the really is', 'Definition': 'veridical descriptor: the one(s) that really is(are) ...', 'Type': 'cmavo'}</quote> describes an actual class of things fitting a selbri, whereas <quote>{'Lojban': 'la', 'English': 'that named', 'Definition': 'name descriptor: the one(s) called ... ; takes name or selbri description', 'Type': 'cmavo'}</quote> attaches to a proper name.  \n2. In the English sentence “The Board decided ...”, “the board” is not a proper name but a descriptive title for a body of people. Rendering it with lo captures the idea “the (group of) board members” without pretending it’s literally named “Board”.  \n3. By contrast, la tanbo would force “tanbo” to be a proper name, implying the board’s actual name is “tanbo”, which misrepresents the source sentence.  \n4. The predicate uses <quote>{'Lojban': \"zu'ejdi\", 'English': 'x1 rejects x2 (offer, suggestion, proposal) from x3 .', 'Type': 'lujvo'}</quote> correctly, and <quote>{'Lojban': 'fitytoltu'i', 'English': 'rejects offer', 'Type': 'lujvo'}</quote> packages the semantics of rejecting a proposal.  \n5. Finally, <quote>{'Lojban': 'stidi', 'English': '- propose; suggests', 'Type': 'gismu'}</quote> is converted with se to obtain the proposal as the rejected idea.  \nTherefore “lo tanbo cu zu'ejdi lo ka fitytoltu'i lo se stidi” accurately renders “The Board decided to dismiss the proposal,” using lo to denote the acting board as a descriptive group rather than misassigning it a proper name."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "Let’s compare the two candidate translations for “The trumpet is tired.”  The key point is how to make the trumpet itself the x1 of “play-instrument,” rather than the musician.  In Lojban, by default “be” links a sumti into the x2 place of a selbri:<quote>“Definition: sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri; used in descriptions”</quote>Thus “lo zgipli be lo tabra” means “the one who plays the trumpet” (x2=tabra), i.e. the musician, not the trumpet.  That is what choice A actually says, so it fails to identify the trumpet as tired.  By contrast, conversion with “se” swaps x1 and x2 of the selbri, making the trumpet itself the x1:<quote>“In particular, after the application of any SE cmavo, ... two of them have been exchanged”</quote>and as shown for klama,<quote>“The place structure of se klama: x1 is the destination of x2’s going …”</quote>so for zgipli, “se zgipli” has x1=instrument played.  Hence “lo se zgipli be lo tabra” literally means “the trumpet that has been played,” i.e. the trumpet itself, which is exactly the natural subject of “tired.”  Therefore the correct translation is choice B."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. Debater_A incorrectly insists on quoting the string “.robert.” with zo, but the English sentence “The cook’s name is Robert” is not about the word “Robert,” it’s about naming the person who cooked. In Lojban, the cmavo <quote>‘la’</quote> introduces a name sumti, “the one called ….”  \n2. As the background defines, <quote>‘la’ … English: ‘that named’; Definition: name descriptor: the one(s) called …</quote>. Thus <invalid_quote>la .robert.</invalid_quote> properly names the person Robert.  \n3. By contrast, <quote>‘zo’ … Definition: quote next word only; quotes a single Lojban word</quote> is a metalinguistic operator for referring to the word itself, not the person. It would produce a sentence meaning “The cook’s name is the word ‘Robert’,” which is not the intended meaning.  \n4. Example 19.53 shows how <quote>zo .bab.</quote> quotes the word “Bob,” followed by <quote>la bab.</quote> to refer to the person named Bob.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. In Lojban, asking “Are you twins?” requires a predicate that relates two participants (the two people referred to by “you”). This demands a two-place predicate (a lujvo) with x1 and x2 sumti places.  \n\n2. The background definitions list both candidate lujvo:  \n<quote>{'Lojban': \"tarbykansi'u\", 'Lojban Composition': 'tarbi+kansa+simxu', 'Type': 'lujvo', 'Arguments': nan}</quote>  \n<quote>{'Lojban': 'tarbykansa', 'Lojban Composition': 'tarbi+kansa', 'Type': 'lujvo', 'Arguments': nan}</quote>  \nNeither entry explicitly states argument structure, but the composition tarbi+kansa indicates a two-place relation (“x1 is a twin of x2”). The additional +simxu in tarbykansi'u signals an intransitive or abstracted form, which does not directly link two sumti.  \n\n3. The structure of the question uses “xu lo re do TWIN” where \"xu\", \"lo\", \"re\", and \"do\" provide the truth-question frame and sumti:  \n<quote>{'Lojban': 'xu', 'English': 'true-false ?', 'Type': 'cmavo'}</quote>  \n<quote>{'Lojban': 'lo', 'English': 'the really is', 'Type': 'cmavo'}</quote>  \n<quote>{'Lojban': 're', 'English': '2', 'Type': 'cmavo'}</quote>  \n<quote>{'Lojban': 'do', 'English': 'you', 'Type': 'cmavo'}</quote>  \nWe then need a predicate that can take exactly these two sumti — \"lo re do\" — as its x1 and x2. That predicate is tarbykansa.  \n\n4. Debater_A’s proposal uses tarbykansi'u, which by its extra +simxu abstractor fails to directly connect the two people named by \"lo re do\". It would instead treat “the two of you” as a single group of twins, without establishing the twin relation between the two individuals. This mismatches the English structure asking whether those two individuals are twin siblings.  \n\n5. In contrast, tarbykansa properly fills the two argument places: x1 = the first of the two you’s, x2 = the second. Thus the translation xu lo re do tarbykansa literally asks “Is the first of you a twin of the second of you?” which exactly matches “Are you twins?”  \n\nTherefore, the correct translation is B: xu lo re do tarbykansa."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "The sentence “I didn’t give anything to anyone” requires negating every instance of both the object variable (something) and the recipient variable (anyone).  In Lojban, the cmavo <quote>no</quote> as a quantifier means “zero of,” so <quote>no da</quote> is “there is no something” and <quote>no de</quote> is “there is no someone.”  By combining them, <quote>no da no de zo'u da dunda de</quote> literally asserts: “For zero X and zero Y, I gave X to Y,” i.e. I gave no thing to any person.<quote>Example 16.69</quote> in the background states: <quote>noda rode zo'u da prami de</quote> “There is no X that loves everything.”  Analogously, <quote>mi no da no de pu dunda</quote> straightforwardly negates both variables.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_A’s option B uses <quote>su'o de</quote> (“at least one person”) instead of <quote>no de</quote>.  That would parse as “For zero X, there exists at least one Y such that I gave X to Y,” which fails to negate the recipient variable universally.  It only says “I didn’t give any one particular thing to someone,” not “I didn’t give anything to anyone.”  Therefore only A correctly captures the global negation of both object and recipient."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. The target sentence “Do you have some wine glasses?” asks whether there exist cups whose contents are wine.  \n2. In Lojban, the gismu <quote>kabri</quote> is defined as “x₁ is a cup/glass containing contents x₂, and of material x₃” – so its second place x₂ names the CONTENT of the glass. <quote>kabri: 'x₁ is a cup/glass/tumbler/mug/vessel/[bowl] containing contents x₂, and of material x₃.'</quote>  \n3. Meanwhile, <quote>vanju</quote> is “x₁ is made of/contains/is a quantity of wine from fruit/grapes x₂,” but here we want to use its first place x₁ (the wine itself) as the CONTENT of a kabri. <quote>vanju: 'x₁ is made of/contains/is a quantity of wine from fruit/grapes x₂.'</quote>  \n4. Therefore the correct structure is su’o kabri vanju: “at least one cup (kabri) whose x₂ is wine (vanju)”, i.e. “some wine glasses.” The quantifier <quote>su'o</quote> naturally supplies “at least one.”  \n5. By contrast, su’o vanju kabri would treat vanju as the head bridi and attach a sumti kabri, yielding “some wine whose x₂ is glass,” literally “wine glasses” in reverse – nonsensical for asking about cups.  \n6. Debater A’s proposal <quote>xu do ralte su'o vanju kabri</quote> wrongly fills the second place of vanju with kabri, asking “Do you have some wine whose fruit x₂ is glass?” – clearly not equivalent to “wine glasses.”  \n7.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The English sentence “The copper wire is one metre long” names an object (“copper wire”) and states its length.

To specify the material (copper) of that cord, we use the gismu <quote>tunka</quote>, defined as <quote>x₁ is made of/contains/is a quantity of copper (Cu).</quote>  \n3. In Lojban descriptive sumti, the head (the primary concept, here the cord) comes last and is modified by preceding descriptors. Thus “lo skori tunka” literally means “the cord that is copper,” i.e. the copper wire.  \n4. By contrast, “lo tunka skori” would treat “tunka” as the head (“the copper”) modified by “skori” (“that is a cord”), a less direct and potentially ambiguous phrasing for “copper wire.”  \n5. The rest of the bridi states the object’s length: <quote>cu</quote> is the selbri separator, <quote>mitre</quote> means “meter” (<quote>x₁ is x₂ meter(s)…</quote>), and <quote>li pa</quote> is “the number one.”  \n6. Putting it all together, the natural and unambiguous translation is “lo skori tunka cu mitre li pa,” making choice B correct and rendering A incorrect."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "We need to ask “Have you worked at a store?” by using the lujvo jibgu’a ‘employee’ with x1=worker (you) and x2=employer (store), and mark the modal ‘can and has’ (pu’i) before that selbri.  In Lojban a bridi with a tense or modal follows the pattern: [tense] [modal] sumti₁ sumti₂ selbri.  \n\n1. The lujvo jibgu’a is defined as “employee” with x1=worker, x2=boss (employer):\n   <quote>{'Lojban': 'jibgu\\'a', 'English': 'employee', 'Arguments': '$gunka1 = jibri2 $gunka2 = jibri1'}</quote>\n   Hence we want x1=do (you) and x2=zarci (a store).  \n\n2. The modal pu’i (“can and has”) must precede the selbri, not the sumti it governs.  As the grammar states:\n   <quote>A CAhA cmavo is always placed after any other tense cmavo ...</quote>\n   And Example 10.145 shows this order clearly:\n   <quote>la frank. pu'i viska — Frank has demonstrated a potential for seeing.</quote>\n   There, ‘pu’i’ comes before the selbri viska, and the sumti la frank. remains x1.  \n\n3. In choice B “xu do pu’i zarci jibgu’a” the cmavo pu’i incorrectly scopes over zarci, making ‘the store’ the thing that “can and has” rather than ‘you’.  That yields the unintended meaning “the store has worked as an employee,” which is nonsensical here.  \n\n4. By contrast, choice A “xu do pu’i jibgu’a zarci” correctly puts pu’i before the selbri jibgu’a and places store as the second sumti.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The key issue is whether the origin (‘from the left door’) must be explicitly tagged with fi, or can simply follow lo zunle vorme without fi.  \n2. In the basic example of a selbri with multiple sumti slots, untagged sumti fill slots in sequence.  As shown in the background: <quote>ta [cu] klama ti zo'e zo'e ta</quote> maps ti→x2 (destination), zo'e→x3 (origin), zo'e→x4 (route), ta→x5 (means).  When only one sumti is given after klama, that single sumti naturally occupies the next available slot, which in our translation is the origin slot x3, matching ‘from the left door.’  \n3. The place‐tag fi is described as an elidable marker used when necessary for disambiguation: <quote>‘elidable marker: separates selbri from preceding sumti, allows preceding terminator elision’</quote>.  But when there is no conflict or ambiguity about which place is being filled, fi may be omitted.  \n4. Debater_A’s insistence that fi is mandatory overlooks numerous examples where a single sumti after a gismu simply fills the intended role without an explicit tag.  In Section 2.11: <quote>Example 2.48. ti [cu] djarspageti</quote> shows that even fu’ivla selbri take their sumti untagged.  \n5. Therefore the simpler form “lo djabei cu klama lo zunle vorme” (B) correctly translates “The waiter came from the left door” without unnecessary fi, yielding a grammatically valid and idiomatic Lojban sentence."}

To express “The child is talking about dogs,” we only need x1 and x3; we can omit x2 (listener) and x4 (language).  \n\n2.

It is only required when a sumti must explicitly be placed in the 3rd slot out of sequence or when earlier sumti are non‐ellipsable.  In our sentence, since x3 is naturally the only remaining sumti and sits at the end, fi is redundant and unidiomatic.\n\n4. Therefore, the correct idiomatic translation is “lo verba cu tavla lo'e gerku,” using ellipsis rather than an explicit place tag. Answer A is correct, and the use of fi in B is unnecessary and breaks standard bridi ellipsis conventions."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The selbri <quote>x_{1} falls/drops to x_{2} from x_{3} in gravity well/frame of reference x_{4}.</quote> shows that FARLU has four places: the object that falls (x1), the destination (x2), the origin (x3), and the frame (x4).\n2. Although the cmavo FI is defined as <quote>sumti place tag: tag 3rd sumti place</quote>, in Lojban you only tag a place when you need to skip an earlier place that is omitted for contextual reasons.\n3. In the English sentence “Some tomatoes fell from the table,” only the origin is relevant and the destination is left unspecified; thus we omit the x2 argument entirely and let the next sumti fill x3 positionally.\n4. By dropping the destination slot and supplying “lo jubme” directly after the selbri, we correctly indicate “from the table” without using FI.\n5. Debater_A’s claim that FI is always required misunderstands that untagged sumti fill the next open place, so explicit place tags are unnecessary when you simply skip x2 by omission.\n6. Therefore the standard Lojban rendition is B: su'o tamca cu farlu lo jubme."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "Debater_A insists on using <quote>ku'o</quote> to close the relative clause, but in fact in Lojban any terminator for a sumti is <quote>ku</quote> unless disambiguation absolutely requires <quote>ku'o</quote>.  Section 9.3 explains that <quote>ku</quote> is the standard \"elidable terminator: end description, modal, or negator sumti; often elidable\".  Here, <quote>su'o xunre ku</quote> cleanly ends the tagged sumti for the red spot, so <quote>lo lolnitku'a</quote> correctly fills x3 (source) of <quote>cpacu</quote>.  Debater_A’s use of <quote>ku'o</quote> is unnecessary and actually forces <quote>lo lolnitku'a</quote> into the inner relative clause started by <quote>poi</quote>, yielding a nonsensical meaning where the ball has a basement inside the relative clause rather than the speaker acquiring something from the basement.  Thus the proper translation is A: <quote>ra cpacu lo bolci poi barna fa su'o xunre ku lo lolnitku'a</quote>."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "We need to close the relative clause started by <quote>poi</quote>.  In standard Lojban, <quote>ku'o</quote> is the terminator for a NOI relative clause, but that terminator is fully elidable in simple cases.  As the grammar states, <quote>\"ku'o: end NOI relative clause; always elidable, but preferred in complex clauses\"</quote>.  Since our sentence has only one short relative clause (<quote>poi se pagbu ci jufmei ku</quote>), we may drop the <quote>ku'o</quote> and use just <quote>ku</quote> to terminate the description and the clause at once.  Indeed, Example 8.9 demonstrates this elision: <quote>\"ti poi prenu cu barda ... without any change in meaning.\"</quote>  Answer B (<invalid_quote>.ai mi seltcitygau lo lisri poi se pagbu ci jufmei ku zo tordydu'e</invalid_quote>) uses <quote>ku</quote> correctly and concisely, while A needlessly inserts <quote>ku'o</quote> and thus overcomplicates a simple relative clause.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "We need to translate “You’re taller than the cupboard with the apples.” The phrase “the cupboard with the apples” is a description sumti introduced by lo followed by a restrictive relative clause poi se nenri lo plise. According to the cmavo definitions, <quote>poi is a \"restrictive relative clause introducer\"</quote> and <quote>ku is an \"elidable terminator: end description, modal, or negator sumti\"</quote>. Section 8.6 warns that for lo-descriptors one must terminate a NOI relative clause with ku, not ku'o, because <quote>The safe strategy, therefore, is to always use __ku__ when attaching a __noi__ relative clause to a __lo__ descriptor. Otherwise we may end up claiming far too much.</quote> If we use ku'o as Debater_A proposes, we close only the relative clause, so the following lo ka rajycla falls unexpectedly inside that clause, mangling the structure. By contrast, using ku properly delimits the sumti _lo kajnyta'e poi se nenri lo plise ku_ so that _lo ka rajycla_ stands at top level as the property of tallness. Therefore the correct translation is B: do zmadu lo kajnyta'e poi se nenri lo plise ku lo ka rajycla."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The English sentence describes one action (waiting) with two sequential locations: first “on the fence”, then “on the roof”. We need a single bridi (predicate) with two locative tails, connected at the predicate level, not two separate bridi.  \n2. In Lojban, the cmavo je is the “tanru logical ‘and’” used to join selbri components into one predicate. As explained, <quote>‘je’ … tanru logical “and”</quote> ensures both predicates apply to the same argument in the same bridi (Section 5.6).  \n3. The tense connective ba (“after”) can be combined with je to yield a tensed logical connective, as shown by Example 10.127: <quote>mi bevri le dakli gi'e bau bevri le gerku</quote> (“and then carries the dog”). Notice that gi'e (another form of je) precedes bake (ba+ke) to connect the two predicate segments.  \n4. Option A uses .e, which is a sumti-level connective (<quote>‘.e’ … sumti afterthought and</quote>, Section 5.6), thereby splitting the bridi into two separate waiting events. That translation yields two bridi: one where the cat waits on the fence, and a second identical bridi where it waits on the roof. This does not capture the intended single action with sequential locatives.  \n5. Furthermore, A’s inclusion of lo before drudi makes “lo drudi” another sumti, rather than part of the predicate tail. In contrast, B omits lo before drudi, correctly treating drudi as the second location-tail of the same waiting bridi.  \n6. Therefore, connecting at the predicate level with je and ba, as in B, yields a single bridi meaning “the cat waited on the fence and then on the roof.” Option B is the precise, standard Lojban translation."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "The core issue is whether the two materials “wood” and “plastic” should be joined inside the tanru (so the bed is simultaneously made of both) or treated as separate sumti (implying two separate predications). In Lojban, <quote>{'Lojban': 'je', 'English': 'tanru and', 'Definition': 'logical connective: tanru-internal afterthought and'}</quote> is the connector you use between brivla **within** a tanru, whereas <quote>{'Lojban': '.e', 'English': 'sumti and', 'Definition': 'logical connective: sumti afterthought and'}</quote> connects entire sumti **outside** of the tanru.  \n\nIn (A), “lo'e mudri je slasi” forms one composite descriptor “wood-and-plastic,” so ckana applies to the **single** material that is both wood and plastic. This matches English “made of wood and plastic.”  In contrast, (B) splits them: “lo'e mudri .e lo'e slasi” creates two separate material sumti for one predicate, effectively saying “this bed is made of wood, AND (separately) this bed is made of plastic.” That does not correctly capture the unified material composition.  \n\nBackground examples confirm this use of **je** in tanru:  \n- <quote>barda je xunre gerku</quote> means “big and red dog” (both properties apply to one dog).  \n- If you used .e instead, you would get two separate claims about the dog, not a single tanru.  \n\nTherefore, the correct translation is (A) lo me ti ckana lo'e mudri je slasi cu marji."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "In Lojban, the cmavo <quote>je</quote> is precisely the connector for joining two selbri into a single tanru, whereas <quote>.e</quote> is used only to connect separate sumti after a selbri.

As shown in Section 5.6: <quote>Example 5.41. barda je xunre gerku — (big | and | red) | type-of | dog</quote> combines “big” and “red” into a single tanru “big-and-red dog.”  Similarly, <quote>mi lo'e silna je pelpeli cu to'e nelci</quote> forms the tanru “salt-and-pepper” as the object of dislike.  By contrast, <quote>.e</quote> is defined as a “logical connective: sumti afterthought and” that connects independent sumti in the same bridi, not to build a compound descriptor.  Using <quote>.e</quote> (as in Debater_A’s A: <quote>mi lo'e silna .e lo'e pelpeli cu to'e nelci</quote>) wrongly treats salt and pepper as two separate arguments to the selbri, making the sentence awkward and diluting the intended unity of “salt-and-pepper.”  Therefore, the better translation is B: <quote>mi lo'e silna je pelpeli cu to'e nelci</quote>."}

FA tags fe and fi explicitly label x2 and x3 respectively.

In (A), “punji fe su’o pinsi fi ro ci’ajbu” means:\n   • fe su’o pinsi → x2 = at‐least one pencil\n   • fi ro ci’ajbu → x3 = every desk\n   Thus, “the teacher puts at least one pencil on each desk,” matching “a pencil on every desk.”\n\n4. In (B), swapping the tags “fi ro ci’ajbu fe su’o pinsi” forces x3 before x2, violating the natural Lojban order and implying “for each desk, choose some pencil,” which reads awkwardly and isn’t standard: you must specify x2 before moving to x3.\n\n5.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. In Lojban, when we ask a question about whether every country has been visited by someone, we must scope the universal quantifier over the sumti “gugde” (countries) before introducing the existential quantifier for people.  \n\n2. Choice B, “xu ro gugde su'o da pu'i se stuvi'e”, places “ro gugde” immediately after “xu”, giving x1 = every country, and then “su'o da” in x2, giving x2 = at least one person.  \n   • <quote>ro da zo'u da viska mi  — “For-every X: X sees me.”</quote> shows that “ro da” correctly scopes over the first sumti.  \n   • By analogy, <quote>ro gugde su'o da zo'u da viska mi</quote> would mean “For every country, there is something that sees me.”  Replacing “viska mi” with “pu'i se stuvi'e” (can-and-has been-visited-by) yields exactly “For every country, there is at least one person who has visited it.”  \n\n3. The use of “se” in “se stuvi'e” converts the selbri so that the country becomes the object of visiting, matching the passive sense “been visited by”.  \n   • <quote>la frank. pu'i viska — “Frank has demonstrated a potential for seeing.”</quote> shows the CAhA modal “pu'i” marking “can and has”.  \n   • Similarly, “pu'i se stuvi'e” marks “can-and-has been-visited-by.”  \n\n4. In contrast, choice A, “xu su'o da ro gugde pu'i stuvi'e”, wrongly scopes the existential person first (x1 = someone) and then the universal country (x2 = every country) but without using “se”.  This parses as “Is there a person for whom every country is the agent of visiting?” which is structurally incorrect. It fails to assign the correct place roles and omits the conversion needed for the passive meaning “has been visited by.”  \n\nTherefore, B correctly captures “Has anybody visited every country?” in standard Lojban, while A misorders the quantifiers and misses the necessary conversion."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The sentence “Every human has at least one embarrassing secret” requires a universal quantifier over humans (every human) and, for each human, an existential quantifier over secrets (at least one secret). In Lojban, the order of quantifiers matters: the quantifier attached to the first sumti takes widest scope, then the next, and so on.  \n\n2. In choice A, mipri su'o jai se ckeji fa ro remna, the existential quantifier __su'o__ applies to the secret first, then __fa ro remna__ tags the x1 place. Quoting the definition:  \n<quote>su'o … Definition: digit/number: at least (some); no less than</quote>  \nand  \n<quote>fa … Definition: sumti place tag: tag 1st sumti place</quote>  \nThus A reads “There is at least one embarrassing secret such that that same secret is kept hidden from each human.” That wrongly says “a single secret” common to all humans, not “each human has a (possibly different) secret.”  \n\n3. In choice B, ro remna cu mipri su'o jai se ckeji, __ro remna__ provides the universal quantifier “for every human,” as stated:  \n<quote>ro da … For-every | X | : …</quote>  \nand __su'o__ then attaches to the secret:  \n<quote>su'o … at least (some); no less than</quote>  \nso that mipri su'o jai se ckeji means “keeps at least one embarrassing secret.” Together B reads “For every human, he/she keeps at least one embarrassing secret,” exactly matching the English.  \n\n4.

Their example ro remna cu mipri su'o jai se ckeji correctly expresses ∀human ∃secret, while A erroneously expresses ∃secret ∀human.  \n\nTherefore, the correct Lojban translation is choice B: “ro remna cu mipri su'o jai se ckeji.”"}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "We want to translate “The wolves howled through the night.” In Lojban, “lo nicte” is “the night,” and the tense/cmavo <quote>ze'u</quote> marks a long time interval “through.” The gismu <quote>cmoni</quote> means “moan/groan/howl,” so “lo labno cmoni ze'u lo nicte” reads literally “the wolves howl for a long interval through the night.”\n\nDebater_A claims that “cu” is required before the selbri, but the grammar explicitly says this marker is optional. The dictionary entry for <quote>cu</quote> defines it as an <quote>elidable marker: separates selbri from preceding sumti, allows preceding terminator elision</quote>. Likewise, Example 2.46 shows “cu” in brackets: <quote>mi [cu] klama ti zo'e zo'e ta</quote>, demonstrating that “cu” may be omitted when the selbri is clear.

Here the sumti is “lo cukta” and the selbri is “se pagbu 361 papri.”\n\n2.

The separator “cu” is optional and only needed to resolve ambiguity:  \n<quote>elidable marker: separates selbri from preceding sumti, allows preceding terminator elision</quote>\nBecause “se pagbu” unambiguously begins the selbri (it is a conversion cmavo), inserting “cu” is redundant and atypical in standard Lojban.\n\n4.

{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The English sentence “Are your legs healthy now?” is a yes/no question, so we start with xu, then a complete bridi whose x1 is “your legs” and whose predicate is “healthy now.”\n\n2. “Your legs” in Lojban is correctly expressed as lo tuple be do. The cmavo be links the selbri tuple (leg) to its x2 sumti (you):\n   <quote>be: sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri; used in descriptions</quote>\n\n3. The predicate “healthy now” is kanro di’a. Here kanro is the gismu “healthy” and di’a is the resumptive aspect indicating “now”:\n   <quote>kanro: x₁ is healthy/fit/well/in good health by standard x₂</quote>\n   <quote>di’a: resumptive contour for resumption of a paused process</quote>\n\n4. Putting it all together as one bridi gives “xu lo tuple be do kanro di’a.” No cu is required because there is no terminator-omission ambiguity. As the background explains for cu:\n   <quote>cu: elidable marker: separates selbri from preceding sumti, allows preceding terminator elision</quote>\n   Since our sumti is closed by the cmavo be and no other terminator is elided, cu is optional and normally dropped for brevity.\n\n5. Debater_A’s choice (A) “xu lo tuple be do cu kanro di’a” needlessly inserts cu, splitting the bridi and breaking the direct be-link. This makes the structure heavier and is unidiomatic when no ambiguity exists.\n\n6. Therefore the more natural, concise, and grammatically correct translation is choice B: xu lo tuple be do kanro di’a."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "We need to see how the gismu cpedu assigns its sumti by default and how Lojban\u0002s variant bridi structure works. First, note that cpedu is defined as “x1 requests/asks for x2 of/from x3 in manner x4.” This tells us the 1st sumti is the requester, the 2nd the thing requested, and the 3rd the source (the person asked). <quote>x_{1} requests/asks/petitions/solicits for x_{2} of/from x_{3} in manner/form x_{4}.</quote>\n\nNext, Lojban allows placing more than one sumti before the selbri, filling the x1 and x2 places, and then any sumti after the selbri fill x3 and x4. As shown in Example 2.16–2.18, two sumti before _cu_ automatically become x1 and x2 without any tags. <quote>Example 2.16. mi ti [cu] vecnu ta …</quote> shows that the first sumti is x1 and the second is x2 by default.\n\nIn A, we have:\nxu do lo vecnu cu cpedu lo ka jdimyjdikygau\nHere “do” (you) is the first sumti (x1 = requester), “lo vecnu” (the seller) is the second sumti (x2 = thing requested), and “lo ka jdimyjdikygau” (the property/discount) is the first sumti after the selbri (x3 = from whom). This perfectly maps onto cpedu\u0002s x1=x requester, x2=x thing requested, x3=x source without extra tags.\n\nDebater_A\u0002s choice B wrongly insists on mixing up the default order and inserting _fi_/_fe_ tags, but those are only needed if you want to scramble or omit sumti. Here the straightforward, untagged order already tracks cpedu\u0002s places correctly, so A is the better translation."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The predicate kucli (– curious) takes an object/abstract in its x2 place, not a question or direct quotation.  As defined, “<quote>kucli: x1 is curious/wonders about/is interested in [object/abstract] x2</quote>.”  In Choice B, <quote>lo ni glare ca lo bavlamdei</quote> is precisely an amount abstraction (a number) denoting how hot it will be tomorrow, which is a valid abstract object for kucli.\n\n2. By contrast, Choice A wraps the measure clause in an indirect question under du'u and kau: <quote>lo du'u ma kau ni glare ca lo bavlamdei</quote>.  However, du'u produces a predication abstraction requiring a full bridi as its x2 (<quote>du'u: x1 is the predication expressed in sentence x2</quote>), and kau marks an indirect question.  So kucli would be curious about a proposition (“who is the temperature-measurer”), not about an abstract quantity.  That contradicts our intent “how hot” (the amount), not “who”.\n\n3. The correct way to express “curious how hot it will be tomorrow” is to supply kucli’s x2 with the amount abstract ni: ni’s place structure is <quote>_ _ni_ _ x1 is the amount of (the bridi) on scale x2</quote>.  Here the bridi is “glare ca lo bavlamdei” (‘is hot at tomorrow’).  Hence B, <quote>mi kucli lo ni glare ca lo bavlamdei</quote>, literally means “I am curious about the amount of hotness at tomorrow,” exactly matching the English.\n\n4.

The gismu <quote>pensi</quote> means “x₁ thinks/considers/cogitates/reasons/is pensive about subject/concept x₂.”  This is itself an event/state predicate that fits perfectly into the x₂ slot of <quote>kakne</quote>.  Thus the nested structure “are ants capable of thinking” is expressed by <quote>kakne pensi</quote>, where <quote>pensi</quote> supplies the event of thinking.  \n\n3.

Altogether:  \n\n   xu kakne pensi fa lo'e manti  \n   “Is it true that the (typical) ants are able to think?”  \n\n4.

In sentence (B) “do zmadu sutra lo drata”, the structure is do (x₁) zmadu (predicate) lo drata (x₂) with sutra filling the x₃ place: “you exceed the others in quickness.”  \n3. In contrast, sentence (A) “do sutra zmadu lo drata” groups sutra and zmadu as a tanru: <quote>when two gismu are adjacent, the first one modifies the second</quote>. Here sutra modifies zmadu, yielding “you quickly exceed the others,” which is an action predicate about *how* you exceed them, not a comparative statement about your speed.  \n4. The intended meaning “you are faster than the others” is not about the manner of exceeding but about the property in which you exceed them.

Moreover, inside the restrictive clause <quote>“poi” is “restrictive relative clause; attaches subordinate bridi with identifying information to a sumti”</quote>, the use of “li pa” is illegal without the elidable terminator “lo'o”; <quote>“li has an elidable terminator, lo'o, which is needed when a li sumti is followed by a logical connective”</quote>, making (A) ungrammatical. 3.

B uses “.e nai lo canko”, whereas A wrongly uses “ge”, which is a forethought connective: <quote>'Lojban': 'ge', 'English': 'fore and', 'Definition': 'logical connective: forethought all but tanru-internal and (with gi)'</quote>.\n3. To negate only the window, we attach NAI to lo canko: <quote>'Lojban': 'nai', 'English': 'negate last word', 'Definition': 'attached to cmavo to negate them'</quote>.  B places NAI directly after .e, correctly negating lo canko; A instead attaches NAI to ge, misplacing the negation.\n4. Finally, the contrast “but” is signaled by KU'I at the end: <quote>'Lojban': 'ku'i', 'English': 'however/but/in contrast'</quote>.  B’s trailing “ku ku'i” properly terminates the descriptor and marks the contrast.  A fails to scope its KU'I correctly under the forethought GE.\nTherefore, only B (“frili fa tu'a lo vorme .e nai lo canko ku ku'i”) faithfully renders “The door is easy, but the window isn’t.”"}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. In Lojban the quantifier cmavo must directly precede the sumti it quantifies.  As shown in Example 6.66, “mi catlu su'o re prenu” means “I look at at-least two persons,” where <quote>su'o</quote> clearly binds to <quote>prenu</quote>.<quote>Example 6.66. mi | catlu | su'o | re | prenu — I look-at at-least two persons</quote> 2. The resumptive aspect cmavo <quote>di'a</quote> is an event‐contour modifier that must be placed immediately before the selbri it modifies, per Example 10.59.  There, <quote>di'a</quote> directly precedes <quote>citka</quote> to yield “I will resume eating my meal.”<quote>Example 10.59. mi | ba | di'a | citka | le | mi | sanmi — I will resume eating my meal.</quote> 3. Putting these together, the natural order is [quantifier + noun] then [aspect] then [selbri], i.e. <quote>su'o ratcu di'a kurji</quote>.  This exactly matches choice A, “xu do su'o ratcu di'a kurji,” meaning “Do you again have at least one rat (i.e. resume caring for pet rats)?” 4. By contrast, Debater_A’s proposal <quote>xu do di'a kurji su'o ratcu</quote> misplaces the quantifier, forcing <quote>di'a</quote> to scope over <quote>kurji</quote> before <quote>su'o ratcu</quote> can even bind.  That violates the binding pattern established by the examples above and leads to an unnatural reading. Therefore the correct translation is choice A."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The translation must correctly represent “haven’t yet matured” with the undemonstrated potential modal <quote>nu’o</quote> scoped only over <quote>makcu</quote>, as in the standard example: <quote>ro cifydatka nu'o flulimna</quote> (“All infant ducks have an undemonstrated potential for swimming”). In sentence B, <quote>lo cakcinki nu'o makcu</quote> cleanly encodes that the beetles can but haven’t yet matured. 2. The justification connector <quote>ki'u</quote> must be followed by a complete event description (a sumti built on an event abstraction <quote>lo nu …</quote>), as demonstrated in Example 9.36: <quote>ki'u le nu la djan. jinga</quote> (“John got the first prize because he won”). Sentence B uses exactly this pattern: <quote>ki'u lo nu ri nu'o gau mi sepsi'u</quote> (“because the event of my not separating them”). 3. The pro-sumti <quote>ri</quote> in B correctly refers back to <quote>lo cakcinki</quote> (“the beetles”), matching the definition: <quote>ri: pro-sumti that repeats last sumti</quote>. In contrast, sentence A with <quote>.i ki'u bo ri nu'o …</quote> misplaces <quote>bo</quote>, preventing <quote>ki'u</quote> from taking a proper event sumti and causing <quote>ri</quote> to pick up the wrong antecedent. Therefore, option B is the only grammatically coherent and semantically accurate translation."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. The key bridi here is zu'ejdi, which means “x1 decides to do x2 (ka)”.  We must say what x2 is: “the action that was easiest for me.”  That action must be expressed as a ka-abstraction selbri describing an action whose ‘easiness for me’ is maximal.  \n\n2. In Lojban, lo ka zukte X describes “the property of performing X.”  Here X itself must denote “the easiest action for me.”  To get X = “the easiest action for me,” we need the selbri frilyrai (lujvo from frili+traji) with its places swapped so that x1 is the action and x2 is the experiencer (‘for me’).\n\n3. We use se-conversion to swap x1 and x2 of frilyrai.  As defined:  <quote>se  SE  2nd conversion  – switch 1st/2nd places</quote>.  Therefore lo se frilyrai be fi mi is “the action that is easy for me.”  Without se, lo frilyrai be fi mi would mean “the property of being easy to me,” not the action itself.\n\n4. Putting it all together: mi zu'ejdi lo ka zukte lo se frilyrai be fi mi literally means “I decide to do the property (ka) of performing the action which is easiest for me.”  That matches “I chose to do what was easiest for me.”\n\n5. Debater_A’s choice (B) omits se.  Without se-conversion, frilyrai’s x1 remains the property rather than the action, so lo frilyrai be fi mi would not refer to the easiest action but to the quality of easiness itself.  Thus (B) fails to place the action in x1 and misrepresents the English.\n\nHence the correct translation is A: mi zu'ejdi lo ka zukte lo se frilyrai be fi mi."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The predicate “zilfadni” requires a unary property abstraction in its first place: <quote>_ _zilfadni_ _ x1 is an ordinary / common / general / typical / usual property among f3_</quote>. 2. We need to express “fighting with one’s parents” as a single property: that is done by lo ka ... kei. 3. Within that abstraction, <invalid_quote>_ _ce'u_ _ x1 is the variable bound inside the abstraction_</invalid_quote> (Section 11.4). 4. By writing “lo ka ce'u damba lo rirni be ce'u”, we bind the same variable ce’u both as the fighter and as the child’s parent, yielding exactly one placeholder “one” that both fights and is parented: a true unary predicate. 5. In contrast, option A attaches <quote>ri</quote> (anaphoric “the last sumti”) which lies outside the scope of the ka-abstraction: it makes the second argument refer to an external antecedent rather than the same lambda variable. That breaks the intended binding and produces a binary relation, not a unary property as required by zilfadni. 6. Therefore the correct, self-contained unary predicate is B: zilfadni fa lo ka ce'u damba lo rirni be ce'u."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. In Lojban, the cmavo <quote>\"be\": sumti link to attach sumti (default x2) to a selbri; used in descriptions</quote>. That means whatever sumti follows “be” becomes the selbri’s x2, while the sumti immediately before is its x1.\n2. In choice A, “lo .ekcala be lo nazbi cu xunre”, the selbri is <quote>xunre</quote> (“is red”). Thus:\n   - x1 = lo .ekcala = “the clown”\n   - x2 = lo nazbi  = “the nose”\n   Reading: \"The clown’s nose is red.\"\n3. In choice B, “lo nazbi be lo .ekcala cu xunre”, we get x1 = “the nose” and x2 = “the clown”. Although that yields the same English meaning, it misapplies the standard Lojban pattern for body‐part ownership: we want the possessor (.ekcala) to occupy the x1 slot of the color predicate, with the body‐part (nazbi) as x2.\n4. Supporting example: when describing a body part inhering in someone, one commonly fronts the possessor before the body‐part.  By analogy to <quote>Example 8.3: ti poi ke'a nazbi ku'o cu barda</quote> (“This thing which is a nose is big”), we see that “nazbi” naturally takes its owner as an adjunct after “be,” but the color predicate itself must have the person first.\n5. Debater_A’s suggestion reverses this order and treats the nose as the primary x1 argument of the color predicate, which violates the usual Lojban ownership idiom.  Therefore the correct translation is A."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. The core issue is correct grouping of the ZAhO modifier <quote>co'a</quote> (initiative) and the event abstraction <quote>lo nu ra jukpa</quote> (the event of their cooking).  In Lojban, every abstraction introduced by <quote>lo nu</quote> must be closed with <quote>ku</quote> to prevent scope bleed (Section 11.2).  Without that <quote>ku</quote>, the parser will attach the <quote>mo'u</quote> (completive) incorrectly to the <quote>co'a</quote> rather than to the event abstraction.  \n\n2. In Choice A (<quote>do gleki co'a lo nu ra mo'u jukpa</quote>), there is no <quote>ku</quote> terminator after <quote>co'a</quote>, so the ZAhO <quote>co'a</quote> remains open through the entire <quote>lo nu ... jukpa</quote> phrase.  This misparses as “you start becoming happy the moment the initiative of their cooking completes,” which is ungrammatical and semantically off.  \n\n3. Choice B (<quote>do gleki co'a ku mo'u lo nu ra jukpa</quote>) correctly closes the <quote>co'a</quote> aspect with <quote>ku</quote> before the completive <quote>mo'u</quote> and the event abstraction.  The structure is then:\n   • <quote>do gleki</quote> “you become happy”\n   • <quote>co'a ku</quote> “as soon as (initiative) ends”\n   • <quote>mo'u lo nu ra jukpa</quote> “the event of their cooking has just completed.”\n\n4. This matches the English “You became happy as soon as they finished cooking.”  The <quote>ku</quote> is indispensable for scoping, as taught in Section 8.6:  “__ku__ is the terminator of the descriptor or abstraction; omitting it changes what the relative/abstraction scope applies to.”  Here it terminates the ZAhO modifier so that <quote>mo'u lo nu ra jukpa</quote> can stand as a separate event clause.  \n\n5. Therefore, only Choice B faithfully renders the timing and aspect (“as soon as they finished cooking”) without misattaching <quote>mo'u</quote> to the wrong predicate.  Choice A lacks the necessary <quote>ku</quote> and thus fails syntactically and semantically."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "The correct translation is “ze’a lo nicte lo ckuliki cu troci nerkla” (A) because in Lojban tanru (compound predicates) are head-final: the last brivla in a compound is the main predicator, and preceding brivla modify it.  Here we want “the mosquitoes tried to enter.”  “nerkla” means “to enter” and is the head of the compound, while “troci” (“to try”) modifies it to mean “try-to-enter.”  In contrast, reversing them as “nerkla troci” would make “enter” modify “try,” yielding “enter-like trying” or “try by entering,” which does not express “tried to get inside.”\n\nSupporting evidence:\n<quote>“troci: x₁ tries/attempts/makes an effort to do/attain x₂ (event/state/property) by actions/method x₃.”</quote>\n<quote>“nerkla: … English: ‘to enter’ … Type: lujvo.”</quote>\n\nExample of head-final tanru in the background text:\n<quote>Example 5.90. la djan. go'i troci  … John tries to.</quote>\nHere “troci” is the head (the action “to try”), modified by “go'i.”  Similarly, in our sentence “troci nerkla” makes “nerkla” the head (“to enter”) modified by “troci” (“try”).  Therefore choice A correctly means “tried to get inside,” whereas choice B does not."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "1. In Lojban, a vocative phrase uses the cmavo DOI to mark the addressee. As the Lojban grammar states, “A vocative phrase begins with a cmavo of selma’o COI or DOI” and can be followed by a free modifier such as an attitudinal. <quote>\"A vocative phrase begins with a cmavo of selma’o COI or DOI, all of which are explained in more detail in Section 13.14.\"</quote>\n\n2. The attitudinal .e’a is the standard way to express granting permission. As defined, “.e’a: attitudinal: granting permission – prohibiting.” <quote>\"Lojban: .e’a; English: permission; Definition: attitudinal: granting permission - prohibiting.\"</quote>\n\n3. Attitudinals are free modifiers that attach to the bridi (predicate) they modify, and must appear immediately before that bridi. Placing .e’a directly before “do ca sipna” makes it unambiguously apply to the sleeping event.\n\n4. In option A (“doi pinfu do ca sipna .e’a”), .e’a comes after the entire bridi and thus risks being read as an afterthought or as modifying only the single word “sipna” awkwardly at the end. By contrast, option B places .e’a in the canonical position for a free modifier: immediately before the main predicate.\n\n5. Therefore, the idiomatic and grammatically correct translation aligns with B:\n   doi pinfu .e’a do ca sipna\n   (“Prisoners, permission: you now sleep.”)"}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "The key difference hinges on how “lo” versus “loi” quantifies “spenysi'u” (couples). According to the grammar, <quote>'lo': veridical descriptor: the one(s) that really is(are) ...</quote>, whereas <quote>'loi': veridical descriptor: the mass of individual(s) that is(are) ...</quote>. In English, “One of the couples is from Morocco” picks out exactly one discrete couple. Using “pa lo spenysi'u” means “one real couple,” matching the English intent. By contrast, “pa loi spenysi'u” would mean “one of the mass of couples,” treating couples as a continuous mass rather than discrete entities. That misrepresents the notion of selecting a single couple from a set. Thus option (A) correctly uses “lo” for discrete quantification, while option (B) incorrectly uses “loi,” making (A) the right translation."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "Debater_A’s proposal <quote>ki lo dormidju zi co'a kakpa fa lo ricyratcu</quote> wrongly treats “ki” as a necessary marker for a simple temporal preposition, but “ki” is in fact only the sticky‐tense flag and not needed here. As explained, <quote>zi | ZI | short time distance</quote> is the correct cmavo to express “around noon” when placed directly before the sumti. Moreover, by inserting “ki” at the front, A inadvertently invokes stickiness: <quote>To make a tense sticky, suffix ki to it</quote>, which is irrelevant for a one‐off temporal adverbial like “around noon.” Choice B, <quote>zi lo dormidju co'a kakpa fa lo ricyratcu</quote>, correctly uses “zi” to indicate a short temporal distance prior to the event without superfluous stickiness. Thus the proper Lojban translation is B."}

The cmavo <quote>pe’u … ‘Please, X’; indicates a request to the listener.</quote>  (Section 13.14). 3. Because vocatives must come before their argument (the addressee sumti), the correct ordering is pe’u ti vajni (“Please, this is important”), not ti vajni pe’u, which would leave pe’u with no following argument and mis-parse the sentence. 4. Therefore the proper translation is A: pe’u ti vajni."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "In Lojban mekso it is usual to rely on the semantic convention that division binds more tightly than addition, rather than cluttering the expression with explicit parentheses. As the background states, “the notion that multiplication takes precedence over addition is too deeply ingrained to be eradicated by Lojban parsing, which totally ignores semantics.” <quote>The first solution is to ignore the problem. People will say _li ci su'i vo pi'i mu_ and mean 23 by it, because the notion that multiplication takes precedence over addition is too deeply ingrained to be eradicated by Lojban parsing, which totally ignores semantics. This convention essentially allows semantics to dominate syntax in this one area.</quote> By the same token, the phrase “li pa pa fe'i mu du li re su'i pa fe'i mu” will be understood naturally as 11/5 = 2 + (1/5), i.e. two and one-fifth. Introducing the explicit left‐bracket marker “vei” in choice A is unnecessary and non-idiomatic, since Lojban even allows parentheses to be omitted when they are not needed. <quote>Note that __ve'o__ (the right parenthesis) is an elidable terminator...</quote> Therefore, the simpler sentence without “vei” (choice B) is the correct, idiomatic translation."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "First, note the meaning of djica: it takes an event or state as its x2. As the background says, <quote>djica: x₁ desires/wants/wishes x₂ (event/state) for purpose x₃.</quote> Here our semantic goal is to express a *state* — that the door *be* on the east side — not to schedule an action or event of moving it there.\n\nOption B uses nu-abstraction (<quote>nu: abstractor: x₁ is state/process/achievement/activity of [bridi]</quote>) producing an *event-of* the door’s being on the east side, then converts stuzi with se. That literally means “the event of someone’s placing the door on the east side,” i.e. an action rather than the *state* the English sentence describes. It misses the immediate, static property of the door’s location.\n\nBy contrast, Option A packages the bridi under ka, the property abstractor. As explained, <quote>ka: abstractor: property/quality abstractor (-ness); x₁ is quality/property exhibited by [bridi]</quote>. Then <invalid_quote>le ka lo stuna mlana cu stuzi</invalid_quote> denotes “the property of being on the east side.” Feeding that into djica as x2 yields exactly “she wants the door’s east-sideness.” This matches the English “She wants the door to be on the east side” by expressing a desired *state* or *property*, not an event.\n\nFurthermore, se-stuzi in B only makes sense if one is focusing on swapping arguments of an action of placing. But here no placing-action is intended. Ka-abstraction is the standard way to express “to be X” as a state. Therefore the correct translation is option A: ra djica lo vorme lo ka lo stuna mlana cu stuzi."}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "We need to distinguish talking about the word “pot” itself (a metalinguistic quotation) versus talking about the object referred to by that word.  \n\n1. “zo” is a quoting operator that “quotes the next word only; quotes a single Lojban word (not a cmavo compound or tanru)” (<quote>zo | ZO | quote single word; quote next word only; quotes a single Lojban word</quote>).  This is used when you literally mean the string of letters or the Lojban word as an object.  \n\n2. “lo” is a veridical descriptor meaning “the one(s) that really is(are) …” (<quote>lo | LE | veridical descriptor: the one(s) that really is(are) …</quote>).  This is used when you refer to the actual thing denoted by the word, not the word itself.  \n\n3. The English sentence “The ‘pot’ in the second sentence should be a ‘cup’” is instructing a correction of the object in that sentence: it’s saying that what was intended to be a pot should actually be a cup.  This is not a comment on the string of characters “pot” and “cup” but on the objects they denote.  \n\n4. Therefore, both mentions must use “lo” to refer to the actual pot and the actual cup, not “zo.”  Using “zo kabri” in (A) would quote the Lojban word “kabri” itself; here we want <i>the cup</i>, so we must say “lo kabri.”  Likewise, “lo patxu” refers to the pot in sentence two, not the word <quote>patxu</quote>.  \n\nHence the correct translation is:  \n.ei lo patxu pe lo re moi co jufra cu se basti lo kabri  \n(option B)."}
{"answer": "A", "cot": "1. The gismu <quote>birti</quote> is defined as “x1 is certain/sure/positive/convinced that x2 is true.”  As a gismu it takes normal sumti arguments (not full bridi abstractions).  \n2.

By contrast, choice B uses <quote>lo du'u ma kau junta lo sfofa</quote> as the second argument to <quote>birti</quote>.  But <quote>du'u</quote> is the predication abstractor—“x1 is predication [bridi] expressed in sentence x2”—which yields a selbri, not a plain sumti.

Therefore the correct translation is A, “mi na'e birti lo junta be lo sfofa.”"}
{"answer": "B", "cot": "The English sentence “Nobody is perfect” requires a negation of the predicate (“perfect”) over the domain of persons.  In Lojban, ordinary negation of an entire bridi is done with the cmavo <quote>na</quote>, not by putting <quote>no</quote> (the digit ‘0’) inside the sumti.  \n\n1. “no” is defined as “digit/number: 0 (digit) [zero]” and is a PA-class cmavo used only to supply the numeral 0, not to negate a statement (see the background definition of <quote>no</quote>).  As such, “no prenu cu prane” simply says “Zero persons are perfect”—it supplies a sumti of 0 persons but leaves the bridi positive.  That fails to carry the negation on the predicate.  \n\n2. In contrast, <quote>na</quote> is the Lojban bridi negator whose scope is the entire bridi.  To say “Nobody is perfect,” we quantify “0 persons” with <quote>no prenu</quote> as the x1 sumti and then negate the predicate “perfect” with <quote>na prane</quote>.  The resulting bridi <quote>no prenu na prane</quote> literally means “Zero persons are not perfect,” i.e. “nobody is perfect.”  This matches precisely the intended universal negation.\n\n3. Debater_A’s choice (A) leaves out the necessary bridi negation and thus cannot express “nobody” in the sense of a negative predicate—merely stating a sumti of zero doesn’t negate the predicate in Lojban’s grammar.

{"answer": "A", "cot": "1) We need to express two distinct predicate‐properties of the carpet: “getting wet quickly” and “drying slowly.” Each is packaged as a property abstraction using “ka.” 2) The cmavo <quote>ka</quote> introduces a property abstraction, but it must be explicitly terminated when part of a compound bridi. 3) In compound bridi, the connector <quote>gi'e</quote> (“and”/“but”) links bridi-tails; to delimit the end of the first tail, the cmavo <quote>vau</quote> is required.

By contrast, choice B <quote>lo’e pacna ra’u ku fliba ta’e</quote> places <quote>ra’u</quote> inside the sumti before <quote>ku</quote>, so it wrongly modifies “pacna” instead of “fliba,” producing “those who mainly hope” as the primary claim and misplacing “chiefly.”  That does not express “fail usually.”  \n4.

The core predicate “kurjysi'u” is the lujvo for “care for each other.”\n\nThe choice “lo mi'o ro kurjysi'u” (B) parses as follows: “ro” quantifies the predicate, giving “each mutual-care”: <quote>Lojban': 'ro', 'Formal Language': 'PA4', 'English': 'each', 'Definition': 'digit/number: each, all'</quote>.  Then “mi'o” (the speaker plus listener) marks the possessor of those care-relations: <quote>Lojban': \"mi'o\", 'Formal Language': 'KOhA3', 'English': 'me and you', 'Definition': 'pro-sumti: me/we the speaker(s)/author(s) & you the listener(s)'</quote>.
