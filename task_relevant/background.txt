It explains newer rules of Lojban not covered by older materials\nsuch as \"What is Lojban?\" and \"Lojban for Beginners\".\n\nIf you are new to Lojban, I recommend listening to any recordings you can find\nof spoken Lojban (readings, music, conversation) both before and while you are\ntaking this tutorial, in order to make yourself familiar with the sounds and\nwords of the language. Furthermore, try to say the things you read in Lojban\naccent if it's reasonably practical. This can help your pronunciation a lot.\n\nWhen taking this tutorial, it's best to pause between lessons in order to\ninternalize what you have learnt. I have attempted to build these lessons from\nthe bottom up and exclude any words or concepts that have not been explained\nin previous lessons. Once explained, they are used freely throughout the\nremainder of the tutorial. I urge readers not to pass any misunderstood\ncontent; if you have questions or are uncertain about something, feel free to\nask the Lojban community, which can be found in Lojban Live Chat or on Google\nGroups. They will be happy to help.\n\nIn this tutorial, Lojban text is written in **bold**. Later, when Lojban\nloanwords are used in English sentences, they are not marked. Answers to\nexercises are displayed as a grey bar. Highlight the text in order to see it.\nEnglish terms are written in _italic_.\n\nLastly, I have as far as possible attempted to use the Lojban words for\ngrammatical constructs: **sumka'i** instead of _pro-sumti_ , **sumtcita**\ninstead of _modal_ and **jufra** instead of _utterance_. This is because I\nfeel the English words are often either arbitrary, in which case they are just\nmore words to learn, or misleading, in which case they are worse than useless.\nIn either case, as long as the words are specific to those who are learning\nLojban anyway, there is no reason for them to exist as separate English words.\n\n## Lesson 0: Sounds\n\nWhile you are (hopefully) eager to get started on the inner workings of Lojban\ngrammar, a short lesson on the sounds and writing conventions of the language\nis beneficial. Learning a language only by reading is hard, and it's not\neasier if your internal voice is mispronouncing it.\n\nFor more details on vowels and consonants sounds used in Lojban, click on the\nletters described. They are pointing to Wikipedia articles which describe the\nsound and usually have an audio record of it.\n\n### Vowels\n\nThere are five proper vowels in Lojban and one almost-vowel. First the proper\nones:\n\n**a** | as in \"father\" or \"large\"   \n---|---  \n**e** | as in \"get\" or \"gem\"   \n**i** | as in \"machine\" or \"scream\" (not as in \"hit\")   \n**o** | as in \"bold\" or \"more\" — not as in \"so\" (this should be a 'pure' sound.)   \n**u** | as in \"rude\" or \"due\" (not as in \"but\")   \n**y** | as \"a\" in \"Tina\" (not as in \"but\")   \n  \n  \n\nThese are pretty much the same as vowels in Italian or Spanish. The sixth\n(almost-)vowel, **y** , is called a \"schwa\" in the language trade, and is\npronounced as \"comm _a_ \", \"tak _e_ n\" or \"s _u_ rprise!\". It's the sound that\ncomes out when the mouth is completely relaxed.\n\nTwo vowels together are pronounced as one sound (and called a \"diphthong\").\nSome examples are:\n\n  \n\n**ai** | as in \"high\"   \n---|---  \n**au** | as in \"how\"   \n**ei** | as in \"hey\"   \n**oi** | as in \"boy\"   \n**ia** | as in \"yacht\"   \n**ie** | as in \"yes\"   \n**iu** | as in \"you\"   \n**ua** | as in \"wander\"   \n**ue** | as in \"wet\"   \n**uo** | as in \"woke\"   \n**ui** | as in \"we\"   \n  \n  \n**i** and **u** act as semivowels when they precede another vowel. Double\nvowels are rare. The only examples are **ii** , which is pronounced like\nEnglish \"ye\" (as in _Oh come all ye faithful_) or Chinese \"yi\", and **uu** ,\npronounced like \"woo\".\n\nNote that because of variation between English dialects, approximations like\nthese will necessarily be wrong for some speakers. The surest way to learn the\nphonology of the language is to imitate those who already speak it!\n\n### Consonants\n\nThere are seventeen consonants in Lojban and one almost-consonant. The Lojban\nconsonants are the same as the English, except that Lojban doesn't use the\nletters H, Q or W. Most of the consonants are pronounced like in English, but\nthere are some exceptions:\n\n**g** always \"g\" as in \"gum\", never \"g\" as in \"gem\"  \n---  \n**c** \"sh\", as in \"ship\"  \n**j** as in \"measure\" or French \"bonjour\"  \n**x** as in the exclamation \"Ach!\", or in German \"Bach\", Spanish \"Jose\" or\nArabic \"Khaled\"  \n  \n  \nThe almost-consonant is the apostrophe This letter is pronounced like the\nEnglish letter H, but is only used between two vowels to prevent them from\nrunning into each other. Thus **ui** is normally pronounced \"we\", but **u'i**\nis \"oohee\". Groups of cmavo are called selma'o and are written using capital\nletters; but unexpectedly the capital version of this letter is **h** not H\n(ko'a is KOhA).\n\nThe combination **dj** is like the **j** in \"joke\". The combination **tc** is\nlike the **ch** in \"chat\".\n\nThe following sound as they do in English, with the exception that **r** is\noften rolled (but does not have to be):\n\n**b** , **d** , **f** , **k** , **l** , **m** , **n** , **p** , **r** , **s**\n, **t** , **v** , **z**.\n\n### Letter names\n\nSpeaking of the letters, what are the names for them? For example, when\nreciting the alphabet in English the letter C is pronounced \"see\". This is\nrather different than the sound the letter makes when used in a word. How\nabout Lojban? Well, consonants are straightforward: The name of a consonant\nletter is the sound of that letter, plus **y**. So the consonant letters of\nLojban, \"b, c, d, f, g ...\", are called **by cy dy fy gy** in Lojban. The\nalmost-consonant **'** is called **.y'y** (pronounced like an agreeing uh-huh\nbut without the stress).\n\nVowels are handled by following the vowel sound with the word **bu** , which\nsignifies we're speaking about a symbol. So the vowels of Lojban are: **.abu\n.ebu .ibu .obu .ubu and .ybu**.\n\nLastly you should know that stress is placed on the second-to-last syllable in\nwords with more than one syllable, ignoring syllables containing **y** , and\nthat one-syllable words are not stressed.\n\n### Correct pronunciation\n\nYou don't have to be very precise about Lojban pronunciation, because the\nphonemes are distributed so that it is hard to mistake one sound for another.\nThis means that rather than one 'correct' pronunciation, there is a range of\nacceptable pronunciation—the general principle is that anything is OK so long\nas it doesn't sound too much like something else. For example, Lojban **r**\ncan be pronounced like the \"R\" in English, Scottish or French.\n\nTwo things to be careful of, though, are pronouncing Lojban **i** and **u**\nlike Standard British English \"hit\" and \"but\" (Northern English \"but\" is\nfine!). This is because non-Lojban vowels, particularly these two, are used to\nseparate consonants by people who find them hard to say. For example, if you\nhave problems spitting out the **zd** in **zdani** (house), you can say\n**zɪdani** — where the **ɪ** is very short, but the final **i** has to be\nlong.\n\n### Writing Lojban\n\nAs you have already seen, Lojban uses the Latin alphabet, though various\nLojbanists have suggested different, usually self-designed ones. Furthermore,\nLojban almost always uses lower-case letters. Capital letters are only used to\nmark stress in proper names, but people tend to avoid them even in names.\n\nApart from the letters, some punctuation is used:\n\nA full stop (period) is a glottal stop (the consonant in the middle of \"uh-\noh\") or a short pause. The rules of Lojban make it easier for one word to run\ninto another when the second word begins with a vowel; so any word starting\nwith a vowel conventionally has a full stop placed in front of it. Full stops\nare not usually used to end sentences.\n\nCommas are rare in Lojban. They are only used to emphasize boundaries between\nsyllables, and adding or removing commas never changes a word's pronunciation\nor meaning.\n\nThe following are found writing styles of different Lojbanists, but they are\nnot conventional:\n\nSpaces are usually used between words. They are mandatory between some words\n(more on that in lesson thirteen). Double or triple space is sometimes used\nbefore the beginning of new sentences. This is to clearly mark sentence shift\nvisually. This might compensate for lack of capital letters which are used for\nthe same purpose in English.\n\nIn òrder to visuàlly reprèsent the stress on the penultìmate syllàble, and\nbècause they find it visuàlly plèasing, some pèople use grave or acute àccents\nòver the vòwel of those syllàbles.\n\nSome people borrow other punctuation marks from English, even though they are\nnot canon, and Lojban is equipped with actual words which should compensate\nfor any punctuation one might want to use. Nonetheless, question marks, for\nexample, clearly marks a sentence as a question and is much easier to catch\nwith the eye than any word is, and so some Lojbanists use them. Quotation\nmarks, parenthesis and exclamations marks can be used similarly. While this is\nnot ungrammatical, since that doesn't interfere with the sentences, some\npeople think exotic punctuation creates an unwanted difference between written\nand spoken Lojban, generally a big no-no.\n\n### Lojbanized foreign proper names (cmevla)\n\nThe following names are Lojbanized - their sounds are transcribed into Lojban\nand their ending sound have been changed to a consonant. The final consonant\nis necessary, because that's how foreign names are differentiated from Lojban\nwords. Again, more on that in lesson thirteen.\n\n_Exercise 1_\n\nWhere are these places?\n\n  1. .nuIORK.\n  2. .romas.\n  3. .xavanas.\n  4. .kardif.\n  5. .beidjin.\n  6. .ANkaras.\n  7. .ALbekerkis.\n  8. .vankuver.\n  9. .keiptaun.\n  10. .taibeis.\n  11. .bon.\n  12. .delis.\n  13. .nis.\n  14. .atinas.\n  15. .lidz.\n  16. .xelsinkis.\n\nAnswer:\n\n  1.

The concept is very\nclose to what we call a proposition in English. A bridi is a claim that some\nobjects stand in a relation to each other, or that an object has some\nproperty. This stands in contrast to **jufra** , which are merely Lojban\nutterances, which can be bridi or anything else being said. The difference\nbetween a bridi and a jufra is that a jufra does not necessarily state\nanything, while a bridi does. Thus, a bridi might be true or false, while not\nall jufra can be said to be such.\n\nTo have some examples (in English, to begin with), _Mozart was the greatest\nmusician of all time_ is a bridi, because it makes a claim with a truth value,\nand it involves an object, Mozart, and a property, being the greatest musician\nof all time. On the contrary, _Ow! My toe!_ is not a bridi, since it does not\ninvolve a relation, and thus does not state anything. Both, though, are jufra.\n\nTry to identify the bridi among these English jufra:\n\n  1. _I hate it when you do that._\n  2. _Woah, that looks delicious!_\n  3. _Geez, not again._\n  4. _No, I own three cars_\n  5. _Nineteen minutes past eight._\n  6. _This Saturday, yes._\n\nAnswer: 1, 2 and 4 are bridi. The rest contain no relation or claim of a\nproperty.\n\nPut in Lojban terms, a bridi consists of one **selbri** , and one or more\n**sumti**. The selbri is the relation or claim about the object, and the sumti\nare the objects which are in a relation. Note that _object_ is not a perfect\ntranslation of **sumti** , since sumti can refer to not just physical objects,\nbut can also purely abstract things like \"_The idea of warfare_ \". A better\ntranslation would be something like \"_subject, direct or indirect object_ \"\nfor **sumti** , and _main verb_ for **selbri** , though, as we will see, this\nis not optimal either.\n\nWe can now write the first important lesson down:\n\nbridi = selbri + one or more sumti\n\n  \n\nPut another way, a bridi states that some sumti do/are something explained by\na selbri.\n\nIdentify the sumti and selbri equivalents in these English jufra:\n\n> I will pick up my daughters with my car.\n\nAnswer: selbri: _pick up (with)_. sumti: _I_ , _my daughters_ , _my car_\n\n> He bought 5 new shirts from Mark for just two hundred euro!\n\nAnswer: selbri: _bought (from) (for)_ sumti: _He_ , _5 new shirts_ , _Mark_\nand _two hundred euros_\n\nSince these concepts are so fundamental to Lojban, let's have a third example:\n\n> So far, the EPA has done nothing about the amount of sulphur dioxide.\n\nAnswer: selbri: _has done (about)_ sumti: _The EPA_ , _nothing_ and _the\namount of sulphur dioxide_\n\nNow try begin making Lojban bridi. For this you will need to use some words,\nwhich can act as selbri:\n\n    **dunda** = _x 1 gives x2 to x3 (without payment)_\n    **pelxu** = _x 1 is yellow_\n    **zdani** = _x 1 is a home of x2_\n\nNotice that these words meaning _give_ , _yellow_ and _home_ would be\nconsidered a verb, an adjective and a noun in English. In Lojban, there are no\nsuch categories and no such distinction. **dunda** can be translated _gives_\n(verb), _is a giver_ (noun), _is giving_ (adjective) as well as to an adverb\nform. They all act as selbri, and are used in the same way.\n\nAs well as a few words, which can act as sumti:\n\n    **mi** = _\"I\" or \"we\" – the one or those who are speaking_\n    **ti** = _\"this\" – a close thing or event nearby which can be pointed to by the speaker_\n    **do** = _\"you\" – the one or those who are being spoken to_\n\nSee the strange translations of the selbri above - especially the x1, x2 and\nx3? Those are called sumti places. They are places where sumti can go to fill\na bridi. Filling a sumti in a place states that the sumti fits in that place.\nThe second place of **dunda** , for example, x2, is the thing being given. The\nthird is the object which receives the thing. Notice also that the translation\nof **dunda** has the word _to_ in it. This is because, while this word is\nneeded in English to signify the receiver, the receiver is in the third sumti\nplace of **dunda**. So when you fill the third sumti place of **dunda** , the\nsumti you fill in is always the receiver, and you don't need an equivalent to\nthe word _to_!\n\nTo say a bridi, you simply say the x1 sumti first, then the selbri, then any\nother sumti.\n\nUsual bridi: (x1 sumti) _(selbri)_ (x2 sumti) (x3 sumti) (x4 sumti) (x5 sumti)\n(and so on)\n\nThe order can be played around with, but for now, we stick with the usual\nform. To say _I give this to you_ you just say **mi dunda ti do** , with the\nthree sumti at the right places.\n\nSo, how would you say _This is a home of me_?\n\nAnswer: **ti zdani mi**\n\nTry a few more in order to get the idea of a place structure sink in.\n\n_You give this to me_?\n\nAnswer: **do dunda ti mi**\n\nAnd translate **ti pelxu**\n\nAnswer: _This is yellow._\n\nQuite easy once you get the hang of it, right?\n\nMultiple bridi after each other are separated by **.i** This is the Lojban\nequivalent of full stop, but it usually goes before bridi instead of after\nthem. It's often left out before the first bridi, though, as in all these\nexamples:\n\n    **.i** = _Sentence separator. Separates any two jufra (and therefore also bridi)._\n\n**ti zdani mi .i ti pelxu** _This is a home to me. This is yellow._\n\nBefore you move on to the next lesson, I recommend that you take a break for\nat least seven minutes to let the information sink in.\n\n## Lesson 2: Skipping around with **FA** and **zo'e**\n\nMost selbri have from one to five sumti places, but some have more. Here is a\nselbri with four sumti places:\n\n    **vecnu** = _x 1 sells x2 to x3 for price x4_\n\nIf I want to say _I sell this_ , it would be too much to have to fill the\nsumti places x3 and x4, which specify who I sell the thing to, and for what\nprice. Luckily, I don't need to. sumti places can be filled with **zo'e**.\n**zo'e** indicates to us that the value of the sumti place is unspecified\nbecause it's unimportant or can be determined from context.\n\n    **zo'e** = _something; fills a sumti place with something, but does not state what._\n\nSo to say _I sell to you_ , I could say\n\n**mi vecnu zo'e do zo'e**  \n _I sell something to you for some price._  \n---  \n  \nHow would you say: _That's a home (for somebody)_?\n\nAnswer:  **ti zdani zo'e**\n\nHow about _(someone) gives this to (someone)_?\n\nAnswer: **zo'e dunda ti zo'e**\n\nStill, filling out three **zo'e** just to say that a thing is being sold takes\ntime. Therefore you don't need to write all the **zo'e** in a bridi. The rule\nsimply is that if you leave out any sumti, they will be considered as if they\ncontained **zo'e**. If the bridi begins with a selbri, the x1 is presumed to\nbe omitted and it becomes **zo'e**.\n\nTry it out. What's Lojban for _I sell_?\n\nAnswer: **mi vecnu**\n\nAnd what does **zdani mi** mean?\n\nAnswer: _Something is a home of me_ or just _I have a home._\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the form doesn't have to be {x1 sumti} {selbri} {x2\nsumti} {x3 sumti} (ect.) In fact, you can place the selbri anywhere you want,\njust not at the beginning of the bridi. If you do that, the x1 is considered\nleft out and filled with **zo'e** instead. So the following three jufra are\nall the exactly same bridi:\n\n  * **mi dunda ti do**\n  * **mi ti dunda do**\n  * **mi ti do dunda**\n\nSometimes this is used for poetic effect. _You sell yourself_ could be **do do\nvecnu** , which sounds better than **do vecnu do**. Or it can be used for\nclarity if the selbri is very long and therefore better be left at the end of\nthe bridi.\n\nThere are also several ways to play around with the order of the sumti inside\nthe bridi. The easiest one is by using the words **fa** , **fe** , **fi** ,\n**fo** and **fu**.\n\n    **fa** = _Tags the following sumti as filling x 1_\n    **fe** = _Tags the following sumti as filling x 2_\n    **fi** = _Tags the following sumti as filling x 3_\n    **fo** = _Tags the following sumti as filling x 4_\n    **fu** = _Tags the following sumti as filling x 5_\n\nNotice that the vowels are the five vowels in the Lojban alphabet in order.\nUsing one of these words marks that the next sumti will fill the x1, x2, x3,\nx4 and x5 respectively. The next sumti after that will be presumed to fill a\nslot one greater than the previous. To use an example:\n\n**dunda fa do fe ti do** – _Giving by you of this thing to you_. **fa** marks\nthe x1, the giver, which is you. **fe** marks the thing being given, the x2.\nSumti counting then continues from **fe** , meaning that the last sumti fills\nx3, the object receiving.\n\nAttempt to translate the following three sentences:\n\n**mi vecnu fo ti fe do**\n\nAnswer: _I sell, for the price of this, you_. or _I sell you for the price of\nthis_ (probably pointing to a bunch of money)\n\n**zdani fe ti**\n\nAnswer: _This has a home_. Here, the fe is redundant.\n\n**vecnu zo'e mi ti fa do**\n\nAnswer: _You sell something to me for this price_\n\n## Lesson 3: tanru and **lo**\n\nIn this lesson, you will become familiar with the concept of a **tanru**. A\ntanru is formed when a selbri is put in front of another selbri, modifying its\nmeaning. A tanru is itself a selbri, and can combine with other selbri or\ntanru to form more complex tanru. Thus **zdani vecnu** is a tanru, as well as\n**pelxu zdani vecnu** , which is made from the tanru **pelxu zdani** and the\nsingle brivla word **vecnu**. To understand the concept of tanru, consider the\nEnglish noun combination _lemon tree_. If you didn't know what a lemon tree\nwas, but had heard about both lemons and trees, you would not be able to\ndeduce what a lemon tree was. Perhaps a lemon-colored tree, or a tree shaped\nlike a lemon, or a tree whose bark tastes like lemon. The only things you\ncould know for sure would be that it would be a tree, and it would be lemon-\nlike in some way.\n\nA tanru is closely analogous to this. It cannot be said exactly what a **zdani\nvecnu** is, but it can be said that it is definitely a **vecnu** , and that\nit's **zdani** -like in some way. And it could be **zdani** -like in any way.\nIn theory, no matter how silly or absurd the connection to **zdani** was, it\ncould still truly be a **zdani vecnu**. However, it must actually be a\n**vecnu** in the ordinary sense in order for the tanru to apply. You could\ngloss **zdani vecnu** as _home seller_ , or even better but worse sounding _a\nhome-type-of seller_. The place structure of a tanru is always that of the\nrightmost selbri. It's also said that the left selbri modifies the right\nselbri.\n\n\"Really?\", you'd ask, skeptically, \"It doesn't matter how silly the connection\nto the left word in a tanru is, it's still true? So I could call all sellers\nfor **zdani vecnu** and then make up some silly excuse why I think it's zdani-\nlike?\"\n\nWell yes, but then you'd be a dick. Or at least you'd be intentionally\nmisleading. In general, you should use a tanru when it's obvious how the left\nword relates to the right.\n\nAttempt to translate the following: **ti pelxu zdani do**\n\nAnswer: _That is a yellow home for you_ Again, we don't know in which way it's\nyellow. Probably it's painted yellow, but we don't know for sure.\n\n**mi vecnu dunda**\n\nAnswer: _I sell-like give_. What can that mean? No idea. It certainly doesn't\nmean that you sold something, since, by definition of **dunda** , there can be\nno payment involved. It has to be a giveaway, but be sell-like in some aspect.\n\nAnd now for something completely different. What if I wanted to say I sold to\na German?\n\n    **dotco** = _x 1 is German/reflects German culture in aspect x2_\n\nI can't say **mi vecnu zo'e dotco** because that would leave two selbri in a\nbridi, which is not permitted. I could say **mi dotco vecnu** but that would\nbe unnecessary vague - I could sell in a German way. Likewise, if I want to\nsay _I am friends with an American_ , what should I say?\n\n    **pendo** = _x 1 is a friend of x2_\n    **merko** = _x 1 is American/reflect US culture in aspect x2_\n\nAgain, the obvious would be to say **mi pendo merko** , but that would form a\ntanru, meaning _I am friend-like American_ , which is wrong. What we really\nwant to is to take the selbri **merko** and transform it into a sumti so it\ncan be used in the selbri **pendo**. This is done by the two words **lo** and\n**ku**.\n\n    **lo** = _generic begin convert selbri to sumti word. Extracts x 1 of selbri to use as sumti._\n    **ku** = _end convert selbri to sumti process._\n\nYou simply place a selbri between these two words, and it takes anything that\ncan fill the x1 of that selbri and turns it into a sumti.\n\nSo for instance, the things that can fill **zdani'** s x1 are only things\nwhich are homes of somebody. So **lo zdani ku** means _a home or some homes\nfor somebody._ Similarly, if I say that something is **pelxu** , it means it's\nyellow. So **lo pelxu ku** refers to something yellow.\n\nNow you have the necessary grammar to be able to say _I am friends with an\nAmerican._ How?\n\nAnswer: **mi pendo lo merko ku**\n\nThere is a good reason why the **ku** is necessary. Try to translate _A German\nsells this to me_\n\nAnswer: **lo dotco ku vecnu ti mi** If you leave out the ku, you do not get a\nbridi, but simply three sumti. Since lo…ku cannot convert bridi, the ti is\nforced outside the sumti, the lo-construct is forced to close and it simply\nbecomes the three sumti of **lo dotco vecnu {ku}** , **ti** and **mi**.\n\nYou always have to be careful with jufra like **lo zdani ku pelxu**. If the\n**ku** is left out the conversion process does not end, and it simply becomes\none sumti, made from the tanru **zdani pelxu** and then converted with **lo**.\n\n## Lesson 4: Attitudinals\n\nAnother concept which can be unfamiliar to English speakers is that of\nattitudinals. Attitudinals are words that express emotions directly. They\nturned out to be incredibly awesome and useful. They all have a so-called free\ngrammar, which means that they can appear almost anywhere within bridi without\ndisrupting the bridi's grammar or any grammatical constructs.\n\nIn Lojban grammar, an attitudinal applies to the previous word. If that\nprevious word is a word which begins a construct (like **.i** or **lo**), it\napplies to the entire construct. Likewise, if the attitudinal follows a word\nwhich ends a construct like **ku** , it applies to the ended construct.\n\nLet's have two attitudinals to make some examples:\n\n    **ui** = _attitudinal: simple pure emotion: happiness - unhappiness_\n    **za'a** = _attitudinal: evidential: I directly observe_\n\nNote that in the definition of **ui** , there are listed two emotions,\nhappiness and unhappiness. This means that **ui** is defined as happiness,\nwhile its _negation_ , means unhappiness. _Negation_ might be the wrong word\nhere. Technically, the other definition of **ui** is another construct, **ui\nnai**. Most of the time, the second definition of attitudinals - the ones\nsuffixed with **nai** \\- really is the negation of the bare attitudinal. Other\ntimes, not so much.\n\n    **nai** = _misc. negation - attached to attitudinals, it changes the meaning into the attitudinal's \"negation\"_\n\nAnd some more selbri, just for the heck of it:\n\n    **citka** = _x 1 eats x2_\n    **plise** = _x 1 is an apple of strain/type x2_\n\nThe sentence **do citka lo plise ku ui** , means _You eat an apple, yay!_\n(especially expressing that it is the _apple_ that the speaker is happy about,\nnot the eating, or the fact that it was you.) In the sentence **do za'a citka\nlo plise ku** , the speaker directly observes that it is indeed the __you__ ,\nwho eats an apple as opposed to someone else.\n\nIf an attitudinal is placed at the beginning of the bridi, it is understood to\napply to an explicit or implicit **.i** , thus applying to the entire bridi:\n\n**ui za'a do dunda lo plise ku mi** – _Yay, I observe that you give an/some\napple to me!_\n\n**mi vecnu ui nai lo zdani ku** _I sell (which sucks!) a home_.\n\nTry it out with a few examples. First, though, here are some more\nattitudinals:\n\n    **.u'u** = _attitudinal: simple pure emotion: guilt - remorselessness - innocence._\n    **.oi** = _attitudinal: complex pure emotion: complaint - pleasure._\n    **iu** = _attitudinal: miscellaneous pure emotion: love - hate._\n\nLook at that, a word with three emotions in the definition! The middle one is\naccessed by suffixinng with **cu'i**. It's considered the midpoint of the\nemotion.\n\n    **cu'i** = _attitudinal midpoint scalar: attach to attitudinal to change the meaning to the \"midpoint\" of the emotion._\n\nTry saying _I give something to a German, who I love_\n\nAnswer: **mi dunda fi lo dotco ku iu** or **zo'e** instead of **fi**\n\nNow _Aah, I eat a yellow apple_\n\nAnswer: **.oi nai mi citka lo pelxu plise ku**\n\nLet's have another attitudinal of a different kind to illustrate something\npeculiar:\n\n    **.ei** = _attitudinal: complex propositional emotion: obligation - freedom._\n\nSo, quite easy: _I have to give the apple away_ is **mi dunda .ei lo plise\nku** , right? It is, actually! When you think about it, that's weird. Why is\nit that all the other attitudinals we have seen so far expresses the speaker's\nfeeling about the bridi, but this one actually changes what the bridi means?\nSurely, by saying _I have to give the apple away_ , we say nothing about\nwhether the apple actually is being given away. If I had used **ui** ,\nhowever, I would actually have stated that I gave the apple away, and that I\nwas happy about it. What's that all about?\n\nThis issue, exactly how attitudinals change the conditions on which a bridi is\ntrue, is a subject of a minor debate. The official, _textbook_ rule, which\nprobably won't be changed, is that there is a distinction between _pure\nemotions_ and _propositional emotions_. Only propostional emotions can change\nthe truth conditions, while pure emotions cannot. In order to express a\npropositional emotional attitudinal without changing the truth value of the\nbridi, you can just separate it from the bridi with **.i**. There is also a\nword for explicitly conserving or changing the truth conditions of a bridi:\n\n    **da'i** = _attitudinal: discursive: supposing - in fact_\n\nSaying **da'i** in a bridi changes the truth conditions to hypothetical, which\nis the default using propositional attitudinals. Saying **da'i nai** changes\nthe truth condition to the normal, which is default using pure attitudinals.\n\nSo, what's two ways of saying _I give the apple away_? (and feel obligation\nabout it)\n\nAnswer: **mi dunda lo plise ku .i .ei** and **mi dunda da'i nai .ei lo plise\nku**\n\nThe feeling of an attitudinal can be subscribed to someone else using **dai**.\nUsually in ordinary speech, the attitudinal is subscribed to the listener, but\nit doesn't have to be so. Also, because the word is glossed _empathy_ (feeling\nothers emotions), some Lojbanists mistakenly think that the speaker must share\nthe emotion being subscribed to others.\n\n    **dai** = _attitudinal modifier: empathy (subscribes attitudinal to someone else, unspecified)_\n\nExample: **.u'i .oi dai citka ti** \\- _Ha ha, this was eaten! That must have\nhurt!_\n\n    **.u'i** = _attitudinal: simple pure emotion: amusement - weariness_\n\nWhat often used phrase could **.oi .u'i dai** mean?\n\nAnswer: _Ouch, very funny._\n\nAnd another one to test your knowledge: Try to translate _He was sorry he sold\na home_ (remembering, that tense is implied and need not be specified. Also,\n_he_ could be obvious from context)\n\nAnswer: **u'u dai vecnu lo zdani ku**\n\nLastly, the intensity of an attitudinal can be specified using certain words.\nThese can be used after an attitudinal, or an attitudinal with **nai** or\n**cu'i** suffixed. It's less clear what happens when you attach it to other\nwords, like a selbri, but it's mostly understood as intensifying or weakening\nthe selbri in some unspecified way:\n\nModifying word  | Intensity   \n---|---  \ncai  | Extreme   \nsai  | Strong   \n(none)  | Unspecified (medium)   \nru'e  | Weak   \n  \n  \n\nWhat emotion is expressed using **.u'i nai sai** ?\n\nAnswer: Strong weariness\n\nAnd how would you express that you are mildly remorseless?\n\nAnswer: **.u'u cu'i ru'e**\n\n## Lesson 5: Reordering places with **SE**\n\nBefore we venture into the territory of more complex constructs, you should\nlearn another mechanism for reordering the sumti of a selbri. This, as we will\nshow, is very useful for making description-like sumti (the kind of sumti with\n**lo**).\n\nConsider the sentence _I eat a gift_ , which might be appropriate if that gift\nis an apple. To translate this, it would seem natural to look up a selbri\nmeaning _gift_ before continuing. However, if one looks carefully at the\ndefinition of **dunda** , x1 gives x2 to x3, one realizes that the x2 of\n**dunda** is something given – a gift.\n\nSo, to express that sentence, we can't say **mi citka lo dunda ku** , because\n**lo dunda ku** would be the x1 of **dunda** , which is a donor of a gift.\nCannibalism aside, we don't want to say that. What we want is a way to extract\nthe x2 of a selbri.\n\nThis is one example where it is useful to use the word **se**. What **se**\ndoes is to modify a selbri such that the x1 and x2 of that selbri trade\nplaces. The construct of **se** \\+ selbri is on its own considered one selbri.\nLet's try with an ordinary sentence:\n\n_ti se fanva mi = mi fanva ti_  \n` This is translated by me (= I translate this). [literally]`  \n---  \n  \n    **fanva** = _x 1 translates x2 to language x3 from language x4 with result of translation x5_\n\nOften, but not always, bridi with **se** -constructs are translated to\nsentences with the passive voice, since the x1 is often the object taking\naction.\n\n**se** has its own family of words. All of them swap a different place with\nthe x1.\n\nse  | swap x1 and x2   \n---|---  \nte  | swap x1 and x3   \nve  | swap x1 and x4   \nxe  | swap x1 and x5   \n  \nNote that **s** , **t** , **v** , and **x** are consecutive consonants in the\nLojban alphabet.\n\nSo: Using this knowledge, what would **ti xe fanva ti** mean?\n\nAnswer: _This is a translation of this_ (or **fanva ti fu ti**)\n\n**se** and its family can of course be combined with **fa** and its family.\nThe result can be very confusing indeed, if you wish to make it so:\n\n    **klama** = _x 1 travels/goes to x2 from x3 via x4 using x5 as transportation device_\n\n**fo lo zdani ku te klama fe do ti fa mi** = **mi te klama do ti lo zdani ku**\nand since **te** exchanges x1 and x3: = **ti klama do mi lo zdani ku** = _This\ntravels to you from me via a home._\n\nOf course, no one would make such a sentence except to confuse people, or\ncruelly to test their understanding of Lojban grammar.\n\nAnd thus, we have come to the point where we can say _I eat a gift._. Simply\nexchange the sumti places of **dunda** to get the gift to be x1, then extract\nthis new x1 with **lo**...**ku**. So, how would you say it?\n\nOne (possible) answer: **mi citka lo se dunda ku**\n\nThis shows one of the many uses for **se** and its family.\n\n## Lesson 6: Abstractions\n\nSo far we have only expressed single sentences one at a time. To express more\ncomplex things, however, you often need subordinate sentences. Luckily, these\nare much easier in Lojban than what one would expect.\n\nWe can begin with an example to demonstrate this:\n\n> I am happy that you are my friend.\n\nHere, the main bridi is _I am happy that X._ , and the sub-bridi is _You are\nmy friend._ Looking at the definition for _happy_ , which is **gleki**\n\n    **gleki** = _x 1 is happy about x2 (event/state)_\n\nwe can see that the x2 needs to be an event or a state. This is natural,\nbecause one cannot be happy about an object in itself, only about some state\nthe object is in. But alas! Only bridi can express a state or an event, and\nonly sumti can fill the x2 of **gleki**!\n\nAs you might have guessed, there is a solution. The words **su'u**...**kei**\nis a generic _convert bridi to selbri_ function, and works just like **lo**\n…**ku**.\n\n    **su'u** = _x 1 is an abstraction of {bridi} of type x2_\n    **kei** = _end abstraction_\n\nExample:\n\n**melbi su'u dansu kei**  \n _Beautiful dancing/Beautiful dance_  \n---  \n  \n    **melbi** = _x 1 is beautiful to x2._\n    **dansu** = _x 1 dances to accompaniment/music/rhythm x2._\n\nIt's usually hard to find good uses of a bridi as a selbri. However, since\n**su'u BRIDI kei** is a selbri, one can convert it to a sumti using\n**lo**...**ku**.\n\nNow we have the equipment to express _I am happy that you are my friend_. Try\nit out!\n\n    **pendo** = _x 1 is a friend of x2_\n\nAnswer: **mi gleki lo su'u do pendo mi kei ku**\n\nHowever, **su'u** …**kei** does not see much use. People prefer to use the\nmore specific words **nu** …**kei** and **du'u** …**kei**. They work the same\nway, but mean something different. **nu…kei** treats the bridi in between as\nan event or state, and **du'u…kei** treats it as an abstract bridi, for\nexpressing things like ideas, thoughts or truths. All these words (except\n**kei**) are called abstractors. There are many of them, and only few are used\nmuch. **su'u…kei** is a general abstractor, and will work in all cases.\n\n    **nu** = _x 1 is an event of (bridi)_\n    **du'u** = _x 1 is the predication of (bridi), as expressed in sentence x2_\n\nUse **nu** to say _I'm happy about talking to you._\n\n    **tavla** = _x 1 talks to x2 about subject x3 in language x4._\n\nAnswer: **mi gleki lo nu tavla do kei ku** (notice both the English and the\nLojban is vague as to who is doing the talking).\n\nOther important abstractors include: **ka...kei** (property/aspect\nabstraction), **si'o...kei** (concept/idea abstraction), **ni...kei**\n(quantity abstraction) among others. The meanings of these is a complicated\nmatter, and will be discussed much later, in lesson twenty-nine. For now,\nyou'll have to do without them.\n\nIt is important to notice that some abstractors have several sumti places. As\nan example, **du'u** can be mentioned. **du'u** is defined:\n\n    **du'u** = _abstractor. x 1 is the predicate/bridi of (bridi) expressed in sentence x2._\n\nThe other sumti places besides x1 is rarely used, but **lo se du'u (bridi) kei\nku** is sometimes used as a sumti for indirect quotation: _I said that I was\ngiven a dog_ can be written **mi cusku lo se du'u mi te dunda lo gerku ku kei\nku** , if you will pardon the weird example.\n\n    **cusku** = _x 1 expresses x2 to x3 through medium x4_\n    **gerku** = _x 1 is a dog of race x2_\n\n## Lesson 7: **NOI**\n\nWhile we're at it, there's another type of subordinate bridi. These are called\n_relative clauses_. They are sentences which add some description to a sumti.\nIndeed, the \"_which_ \" in the previous sentence marked the beginning of a\nrelative clause in English describing relative clauses. In Lojban, they come\nin two flavors, and it might be worth distinguishing the two kinds before\nlearning how to express them.\n\nThe two kinds are called restrictive and non-restrictive (or incidential)\nrelative clauses. An example would be good here:\n\n> _My brother, who is two meters tall, is a politician._\n\nThis can be understood in two ways. I could have several brothers, in which\ncase saying he is two meters tall will let you know which brother I am talking\nabout. Or I might have only one brother, in which case I am simply giving you\nadditional information.\n\nIn English as well as Lojban we distinguish between these two kinds – the\nfirst interpretation is restrictive (since it helps restrict the possible\nbrothers I might be talking about), the second non-restrictive. When speaking\nEnglish, context and tone of voice (or in written English, punctuation) helps\nus distinguish between these two, but not so in Lojban. Lojban uses the\nconstructs **poi…ku'o** and **noi…ku'o** for restrictive and non-restrictive\nrelative clauses, respectively.\n\nLet's have a Lojbanic example, which can also explain our strange gift-eating\nbehavior in the example in lesson five:\n\n    **noi** = _begin non-restrictive relative clause (can only attach to sumti)_\n    **poi** = _begin restrictive relative clause (can only attach to sumti)_\n    **ku'o** = _end relative clause_\n**mi citka lo se dunda ku poi plise ku'o**  \n _I eat the gift that (something is) an apple._  \n---  \n  \nHere the **poi…ku'o** is placed just after **lo se dunda ku** , so it applies\nto the gift. To be strict, the relative clause does not specify what it is,\nwhich is an apple, but given the context we can safely assume that it means\nthat the gift is an apple. If we want to be absolutely sure that it indeed was\nthe gift that was an apple, we use the word **ke'a** , which is a **sumka'i**\n(a Lojban pronoun, more on them later) representing the sumti which the\nrelative clause is attached to. **ke'a** is often omitted for brevity when it\nwould be in the x1 place of the relative clause.\n\n    **ke'a** = _sumka'i; refers to the sumti, to which the relative clause it attached._\n**ui mi citka lo se dunda ku poi ke'a plise ku'o**  \n _Yay, I eat the gift that is an apple._  \n---  \n  \nTo underline the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive relative\nclauses, here's another example:\n\n    **lojbo** = _x 1 reflects Lojbanic culture/community is aspect x2; x1 is Lojbanic._\n**mi noi lojbo ku'o fanva fo lo lojbo ku**  \n _I, who am a Lojbanic, translate from some Lojbanic language._  \n---  \n  \nHere, there is not multiple things which **mi** could refer to, and the fact\nthat I am lojbanic is merely additional information not needed to identify me.\nTherefore **noi…ku'o** is appropriate.\n\nSee if you can translate this:\n\n> _I flirt with the man who is beautiful/handsome._\n\n    **nanmu** = _x 1 is a man_\n    **melbi** = _x 1 is beautiful to x2 in aspect (ka) x3 by standard x4_\n    **cinjikca** = _x 1 flirts/courts x2, exhibiting sexuality x3 by standard x4_\n\nAnswer: **mi cinjikca lo nanmu ku poi (ke'a) melbi ku'o**\n\nOn a more technical side note, it might be useful to know that **lo (selbri)\nku** is often seen defined as **zo'e noi ke'a (selbri) ku'o**.\n\nBesides, it is also possible to connect two or more relative clauses to the\nsame sumti, by using the relative clause joiner **zi'e**. It's syntax is\n\"sumti + relative clause + **zi'e** \\+ relative clause (+ **zi'e** \\+ relative\nclause (...))\". Here is an example:\n\n    **penmi** = _x 1 meets/encounters x2 at/in location x3_\n    **dasni** = _x 1 wears/is robed/garbed in x2 as a garment of type x3_\n**mi tavla lo nanmu ku poi do penmi ke'a ku'o zi'e noi dasni lo xunre ku\nku'o**  \n _I talked to the man that you met and which (incidentally) was dressed in\nred._  \n`... and which wears something red... [literally]`  \n---  \n  \n## Lesson 8: Terminator elision\n\n**je'u mi djica lo nu le merko poi tunba mi _vau ku'o ku_ jimpe lo du'u mi na\nnelci lo nu ri darxi mi _vau kei ku vau kei ku vau kei ku vau_**  \n _I do wish the American, who is my sibling, would understand that I don't\nlike that he hits me._  \n---  \n  \nRegardless of whether the above sentence is being understood, (it shouldn't,\nas it contains words we have not covered in these lessons yet) one thing\nstands out: As more complex Lojban structures are learned, more and more of\nthe sentences get filled with **ku** , **kei** , **ku'o** and other of those\nwords which by themselves carry no meaning.\n\nThe function of all these words is to signal the end of a certain grammatical\nconstruct, like for instance _convert selbri to sumti_ in the case of **ku**.\nThe English word for this kind of word is _terminator_ , the Lojban word is\n**famyma'o**. They are underlined in the example above.\n\nNote: The **vau** in the above example are the famyma'o for _end bridi_. There\nis a good reason you have not yet seen it, stay tuned.\n\n    **vau** = _famyma'o: terminates bridi._\n\nIn most spoken and written Lojban, most famyma'o are skipped (elided). This\ngreatly saves syllables in speech and space in writing, however, one must\nalways be careful when eliding famyma'o. In the simple example **lo merko ku\nklama** , removing the famyma'o **ku** would yield **lo merko klama** , which\nis a single sumti made from the tanru **merko klama**. Thus, it means _an\nAmerican traveler_ instead of _an American travels_. famyma'o elision can lead\nto very wrong results if done incorrectly, which is why you haven't learned\nabout it until now.\n\nThe rule for when famyma'o can be elided is very simple, at least in theory:\n_You can elide a famyma'o,_if and only if_ doing so does not change the\ngrammatical constructs in the sentence._ In other words, a construct extends\nas far right as possible, until either its famyma'o or another word not\nallowed in the construct appears.\n\nMost famyma'o can be safely elided at the end of the bridi. Exceptions are the\nobvious ones like _end quote_ -famyma'o and _end bridi grouping_ -famyma'o.\nThis is why **vau** is almost never used – simply beginning a new bridi with\n**.i** will almost always terminate the preceding bridi anyway. It has one\nfrequent use, however. Since attitudinals always apply to the preceding word,\napplying it to a famyma'o applies it to the entire construct which is\nterminated. Using **vau** , one can then use attitudinals afterthought and\napply them to the entire bridi:\n\n**za'a do dunda lo zdani {ku} lo prenu {ku}... vau .i'e**  \n _I see that you give a home to a person... I approve!_  \n---  \n  \n    **prenu** = _x 1 is a person; x1 has a personality._\n\nKnowing the basic rules for famyma'o elision, we can thus return to the\noriginal sentence and begin removing famyma'o:\n\n**je'u mi djica lo nu le merko poi tunba mi _vau ku'o ku_ jimpe lo du'u mi na\nnelci lo nu ri darxi mi _vau kei ku vau kei ku vau kei ku vau_**  \n---  \n  \nWe can see that the first **vau** is grammatically unnecessary, because the\nnext non-famyma'o-word is **jimpe** , which is a selbri. Since there can only\nbe one selbri per bridi, **vau** is not needed. Since **jimpe** as a selbri\ncannot be in the relative clause either (only one bridi in a clause, only one\nselbri in each bridi), we can elide **ku'o**. Likewise, **jimpe** cannot be a\nsecond selbri inside the construct **le merko poi{...}** , so the **ku** is\nnot needed either. Furthermore, all the famyma'o at the very end of the\nsentence can be elided too, since beginning a new bridi will terminate all of\nthese constructs anyway.\n\nWe then end up with:\n\n**je'u mi djica lo nu le merko poi tunba mi jimpe lo du'u mi na nelci lo nu ri\ndarxi mi**  \n---  \n  \nwith no famyma'o at all!\n\nWhen eliding famyma'o, it is a good idea to be acquainted with **cu**. **cu**\nis one of those words which can make your (Lojbanic) life a lot easier. What\nit does is to separate any previous sumti from the selbri. One could say that\nit defines the next word to be a selbri, and terminates exactly as much as it\nneeds to in order to do that.\n\n    **cu** = _elidable marker: separates selbri from preceding sumti, allows preceding famyma'o elision._\n    **prami** = _x 1 loves x2_\n**lo su'u do cusku lo se du'u do prami mi _vau kei ku vau kei ku_ se djica mi  \n= lo su'u do cusku lo se du'u do prami mi _cu_ se djica mi**  \n _That you say that you love me is desired by be = I wish you said you loved\nme._  \n---  \n  \nNote: **cu** is not a famyma'o, because it is not tied to one specific\nconstruct. But it can be used to elide other famyma'o.\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of **cu** is that it quickly becomes easy to\nintuitively understand. By itself it means nothing, but it reveals the\nstructure of Lojban expressions by identifying the core selbri. In the\noriginal example with the violent American brother, using **cu** before\n**jimpe** does not change the meaning of the sentence in any way, but might\nmake it easier to read.\n\nIn the following couple of lessons, **cu** will be used when necessary, and\nall famyma'o elided if possible. The elided famyma'o will be encased in curly\nbrackets, as shown below. Try to translate it!\n\n**.a'o do noi ke'a lojbo .o'a dai {ku'o} cu jimpe lo du'u lo famyma'o {ku} cu\nvajni {vau} {kei} {ku} {vau}**\n\n    **vajni** = _x 1 is important to x2 for reason x3_\n    **jimpe** = _x 1 understands that x2 (du'u-abstraction) is true about x3_\n    **a'o** = _attitudinal: simple propositional emotion: Hope - despair_\n    **o'a** = _attitudinal: simple propositional emotion: pride - modesty/humility - shame_\n    **dai** = _attitudinal modifier: Empathy (subscribes attitudinal to someone else, unspecified)_\n\nWhat do I state?\n\nAnswer: _I hope that you, a proud Lojbanist, understands that famyma'o are\nimportant_\n\nFun side note: Most people well-versed in famyma'o-elision do it so\ninstinctively that they often must be reminded how important understanding\nfamyma'o are to the understanding of Lojban. Therefore, each Tuesday have been\ndesignated _Terminator Day_ or **famyma'o djedi** on the Lojban IRC chatroom.\nDuring Terminator Day, many people try (and often fail) to remember writing\nout all famyma'o with some very verbose conversations as a result.\n\n## Lesson 9: sumtcita\n\nSo far we have been doing pretty well with the selbri we have had at hand.\nHowever, there is a finite amount of defined selbri out there, and in many\ncases the sumti places are not useful for what we had in mind. What if, say, i\nwant to say that I am translating using a computer? There is no place in the\nstructure of **fanva** to specify what tool I translate with, since, most of\nthe time, that is not necessary. Not to worry, this lesson is on how to add\nadditional sumti places to the selbri.\n\nThe most basic way to add sumti places are with **fi'o SELBRI fe'u** (yes,\nanother example of a famyma'o, **fe'u**. It's almost never necessary, so this\nmight be the last time you ever see it.)\n\nIn between these two words goes a selbri, and like **lo SELBRI ku** , **fi'o\nSELBRI fe'u** extracts the x1 of the selbri put into it. However, with **fi'o\nSELBRI fe'u** , the selbri place is converted, not to a sumti, but to a\n**sumtcita** , meaning _sumti-label_ , with the place structure of the x1 of\nthe selbri it converted. This **sumtcita** then absorbs the next sumti. One\ncould say that using a **sumtcita** , you import a sumti place from another\nselbri, and add it to the bridi being said.\n\nNote: Sometimes, especially in older texts, the term _tag_ or _modal_ is used\nfor **sumtcita**. Ignore those puny English expressions. We teach proper\nLojban here.\n\nWhile it is hard to grasp the process from reading about it, an example can\nperhaps show its actual simplicity:\n\n    **skami** = _x 1 is a computer for purpose x2_\n    **pilno** = _x 1 uses x2 as a tool for doing x3_\n\n**mi fanva ti fi'o se pilno {fe'u} lo skami {ku}{vau}** \\- _I translate this\nwith a computer_ The x2 of **pilno** , which is the x1 of **se pilno** is a\nplace structure for a tool being used by someone. This place structure is\ncaptured by **fi'o SELBRI fe'u** , added to the main selbri, and then filled\nby **lo skami**. The idea of **sumtcita** is sometimes expressed in English\nusing the following translation:\n\n_I translate this with-tool: A computer_\n\nA **sumtcita** can only absorb one sumti, which is always the following one.\nAlternatively, one can use the **sumtcita** construct by itself without sumti.\nIn this case you need to put it either before the selbri or terminate it with\n**ku**. In such case one can think as if the sumtcita has the word **zo'e** as\nthe sumti.\n\n    **zukte** = _x 1 is a volitional entity carrying out action x2 for purpose x3_\n    **zarci** = _x 1 is a market/store/exchange/shop(s) selling/trading (for) x2, operated by/with participants x3_\n\n**fi'o zukte {fe'u} ku lo prenu {ku} cu klama lo zarci {ku}{vau}** \\- _By\ntheir own volition, a person is going to the store_\n\nNote that there is **ku** in **fi'o zukte {fe'u} ku**. Without it the sumtcita\nwould have absorbed **lo prenu {ku}** and we don't want that.\n\nWe can say the same in other words:\n\n**fi'o zukte {fe'u} zo'e lo prenu {ku} cu klama lo zarci {ku}{vau}**\n\n**lo prenu {ku} cu fi'o zukte fe'u klama lo zarci {ku}{vau}**\n\nretaining the meaning.\n\nWhat does **mi jimpe fi lo skami fi'o se tavla {fe'u} mi** state?\n\nAnswer: _I understand something about computers, spoken to me_\n\nPutting the **sumtcita** right in front of the selbri also makes it self-\nterminate, since sumtcita only can absorb sumti, and not selbri. This fact\nwill be of importance in next lesson, as you will see.\n\nActually, **fi'o** is not used very often despite its flexibility. What IS\nused very often, though, are BAI. BAI is a class of Lojban words, which in\nthemselves act as **sumtcita**. An example of this is **zu'e** , the BAI for\n**zukte**. Grammatically, **zu'e** is the same as **fi'o zukte fe'u**. Thus,\nthe above example could be reduced to:\n\n**zu'e ku lo prenu {ku} cu klama lo zarci {ku}{vau}**. There exist something\nlike 60 BAI, and a lot of these are very useful indeed. Furtermore, BAI can\nalso be converted with **se** and friends, meaning that **se zu'e** is equal\nto **fi'o se zukte fe'u** , which results in a great deal more BAI.\n\n## Lesson 10: **PU** , **FAhA** , **ZI** , **VA** , **ZEhA** , **VEhA**\n\nHow unfamiliar a language like Lojban must seem to an English-speaker, when\none can read through nine lessons of Lojban grammar without meeting a tense\nonce! This is because, unlike many natural languages (most Indo-European ones,\nfor instance), all tenses in Lojban are optional. Saying **mi citka lo cirla\n{ku}** can mean _I eat cheese_ or _I ate the cheese_ or _I always eat cheese_\nor _In a moment, i will have just finished eating cheese_. Context resolves\nwhat is correct, and in most conversation, tenses are not needed at all.\nHowever, when it's needed it's needed, and it must be taught. Furthermore,\nLojban tenses are unusual because they treat time and space fundamentally the\nsame - saying that I worked a long time ago is not grammatically different\nthan saying I work far away to the north.\n\nLike many other languages, the Lojban tense system is perhaps the most\ndifficult part of the language. Unlike many other languages though, it's\nperfectly regular and makes sense. So fear not, for it will not involve\nsweating to learn how to modify the selbri or anything silly like that.\n\nNo, in the Lojban tense system, all tenses are sumtcita, which we have\nconveniently just made ourselves familiar with. Okay okay, technically, tenses\nare slightly different from other sumtcita, but this difference is almost\ninsignificant, and won't be explained until later. In most aspects they are\nlike all other sumtcita; they are terminated by **ku** , making it explicit\nthat PU is terminated by **ku**.\n\nThere are many different kinds of tense-sumtcita, so let's start at the ones\nmost familiar to English-speakers.\n\n    **pu** = _sumtcita: before {sumti}_\n    **ca** = _sumtcita: at the same time as {sumti}_\n    **ba** = _sumtcita: after {sumti}_\n\nThese are like the English concepts _before_ , _now_ and _after_. In actuality\nthough, one could argue that two point-like events can never occur exactly\nsimultaneously, rendering **ca** useless. But **ca** extends slightly into the\npast and the future, meaning just _about now_. This is because human beings\ndon't perceive time in a perfectly logical way, and the Lojban tense system\nreflects that.\n\nSide note: It was actually suggested making the Lojban tense system\nrelativistic. That idea, however, was dropped, because it is counter-\nintuitive, and would mean that to learn Lojban, one would have to learn the\ntheory of relativity first.\n\nSo, how would you say _I express this (pointing to a paper) after I came to\nthis place?_\n\nAnswer: **mi cusku ti ba lo nu mi klama ti {vau} {kei} {ku} {vau}**\n\nUsually when speaking, we do not need to specify which event in the past this\naction is relative to. In: _I gave a computer away_ , we can assume that the\naction happened relative to _now_ , and thus we can elide the sumti of the\nsumtcita, because it's obvious:\n\n**pu ku mi dunda lo skami {ku} {vau}** or\n\n**mi dunda lo skami {ku} pu {ku} {vau}** or, more commonly\n\n**mi pu {ku} dunda lo skami {ku} {vau}**. The sumti which fills the sumtcita\nis an implied **zo'e** , which is almost always understood as relative to the\nspeaker's time and place (this is especially important when speaking about\nleft and right). If speaking about some events that happened some other time\nthan the present, it is sometimes assumed that all tenses are relative to that\nevent which is being spoken about. In order to clarify that all tenses are\nrelative to the speaker's current position, the word **nau** can be used at\nany time. Another word, **ki** marks a tense which is then considered the new\nstandard. That will be taught way later.\n\n    **nau** = _updates temporal and spacial frame of reference to the speaker's current here and now._\n    **gugde** = _x 1 is the country of people x2 with land/territory x3_\n\nAlso note that **mi pu {ku} klama lo merko gugde {ku} {vau}** , _I went to\nAmerica_ , does not imply that I'm not still traveling to USA, only that it\nwas also true some time in the past, for instance five minutes ago.\n\nAs mentioned, spacial and temporal time tenses are very much alike. Contrast\nthe previous three time tenses with these four spacial tenses:\n\n    **zu'a** = _sumtcita: left of {sumti}_\n    **ca'u** = _sumtcita: in front of {sumti}_\n    **ri'u** = _sumtcita: right of {sumti}_\n    **bu'u** = _sumtcita: at the same place as {sumti} (spacial equivalent of**ca**)_\n    **.o'o** = _attitudinal: complex pure emotion: patience - tolerance - anger_\n\nWhat would **.o'o nai ri'u ku lo prenu {ku} cu darxi lo gerku {ku} pu {ku}\n{vau}** mean?\n\n    **darxi** = _x 1 beats/hits x2 with instrument x3 at locus x4_\n\nAnswer: _{anger!} To the right (of something, probably me) and in the past (of\nsome event), something is an event of a person beating a dog._ or _A man hit a\ndog to my right!_\n\nIf there are several tense sumtcita in one bridi, the rule is that you read\nthem from left to right, thinking it as a so called _imaginary journey_ ,\nWhere you begin at an implied point in time and space (default: the speaker's\nnow and here), and then follow the sumtcita one at a time from left to right.\n\nExample\n\n**mi pu {ku} ba {ku} jimpe fi lo lojbo famyma'o {ku} {vau}** = _At some time\nin the past, I will be about to know about famyma'os._\n\n**mi ba {ku} pu {ku} jimpe fi lo lojbo famyma'o {ku} {vau}** _At some point in\nthe future, I will have understood about famyma'os._\n\nSince we do not specify the amount of time we move back or forth, the\nunderstanding could in both cases happen in the future or the past of the\npoint of reference.\n\nAlso, if spacial and temporal tenses are mixed, the rule is to always put\ntemporal before spacial.\n\nSuppose we want to specify that the a man hit a dog just a minute ago. The\nwords **zi** , **za** and **zu** specifies a short, unspecified (presumably\nmedium) and long distance in time. Notice the vowel order **i** , **a** and\n**u**. This order appears again and again in Lojban, and might be worth to\nmemorize. _Short_ and _long_ in are always context dependent, relative and\nsubjective. Two hundred years is a short time for a species to evolve, but a\nlong time to wait for the bus.\n\n    **zi** = _sumtcita: Ocurring the small distance of {sumti} in time from point of reference_\n    **za** = _sumtcita: Ocurring the unspecified(medium) distance of {sumti} in time from point of reference_\n    **zu** = _sumtcita: Ocurring the far distance of {sumti} in time from the point of reference_\n\nSimilarly, spacial distance is marked by **vi** , **va** and **vu** for short,\nunspecified (medium) and long distance in space.\n\n    **vi** = _sumtcita: Ocurring the small distance of {sumti} in space from point of reference_\n    **va** = _sumtcita: Ocurring the unspecified(medium) distance of {sumti} in space from point of reference_\n    **vu** = _sumtcita: Ocurring the far distance of {sumti} in space from the point of reference_\n    **gunka** = _x 1 works at x2 with objective x3_\n\nTranslate: **ba {ku} za ku mi vu {ku} gunka {vau}**\n\nAnswer: _Some time in the future, I will work a place far away_\n\nNote: People rarely use **zi** , **za** or **zu** without a **pu** or **ba**\nin front of it. This is because most people always need to specify past or\nfuture in their native language. When you think about it Lojbanically, most of\nthe time the time-direction is obvious, and the **pu** or **ba** superfluous!\n\nThe order in which direction-sumtcita and distance-sumtcita are said makes a\ndifference. Remember that the meanings of several tense words placed together\nare pictured by an imaginary journey reading from left to right. Thus **pu\nzu** is _a long time ago_ while **zu pu** is _in the past of some point in\ntime which is a long time toward the future or the past of now_. In the first\nexample, **pu** shows that we begin in the past, **zu** then that it is a long\ntime backwards. In the second example, **zu** shows that we begin at some\npoint far away in time from now, **pu** then, that we move backwards from that\npoint. Thus **pu zu** is always in the past. **zu pu** could be in the future.\nThe fact that these time tenses combine in this way is one of the differences\nbetween tense sumtcita and other sumtcita. The meanings of other sumtcita are\nnot altered by the presence of additional sumtcita in a bridi.\n\nAs briefly implied earlier, all these constructs basically treat bridi as if\nthey were point-like in time and space. In actuality, most events play out\nover a span of time and space. In the following few paragraphs, we will learn\nhow to specify intervals of time and space.\n\n    **ze'i** = _sumtcita: spanning over the short time of {sumti_}\n    **ze'a** = _sumtcita: spanning over the unspecified (medium) time of {sumti_}\n    **ze'u** = _sumtcita: spanning over the long time of {sumti_}\n    **ve'i** = _sumtcita: spanning over the short space of {sumti_}\n    **ve'a** = _sumtcita: spanning over the unspecified (medium) space of {sumti_}\n    **ve'u** = _sumtcita: spanning over the long space of {sumti_}\n\nSix words at a time, I know, but remembering the vowel sequence and the\nsimilarity of the initial letter z for temporal tenses and v for spacial\ntenses might help the memorizing.\n\n    **.oi** = _attitudinal: pain - pleasure_\n\nTranslate: **.oi dai do ve'u {ku} klama lo dotco gugde {ku} ze'u {ku} {vau}**\n\nAnswer: _Ouch, you spend a long time traveling a long space to Germany_\n\n  \n**ze'u** and its brothers also combine with other tenses to form compound\ntenses. The rule for **ze'u** and the others are that any tenses preceding it\nmarks an endpoint of the process (relative to the point of reference) and any\ntenses coming after it marks the other endpoint relative to the first. This\nshould be demonstrated with a couple of examples:\n\n**.o'ocu'i do citka pu {ku} ze'u {ku} ba {ku} zu {ku} {vau}** \\- _{tolerance}\nyou eat beginning in the past and for a long time ending at some point far\ninto the future of when you started_ or _Hmpf, you ate for a long time_. One\ncan also contrast **do ca {ku} ze'i {ku} pu {ku} klama {vau}** with **do pu\n{ku} ze'i {ku} ca {ku} klama {vau}**. The first event of traveling has one\nendpoint in the present and extends a little towards the past, while the\nsecond event has one endpoint in the past and extends only to the present\n(that is, slighty into the past or future) of that endpoint.\n\n    **jmive** = _x 1 is alive by standard x2_\n\nWhat does **ui mi pu {ku} zi {ku} ze'u {ku} jmive {vau}** express?\n\nAnswer: _{happiness!} I live from a little into the past and a long way\ntowards the future or past (obviously the future, in this case) of that event_\nor _I am young, and have most of my life ahead of me :)_\n\nJust to underline the similarity with spacial tenses, let's have another\nexample, this time with spacial tenses:\n\n    **.u'e** = _attitudinal: wonder - commonplace_\n\n**.u'e za'a bu'u {ku} ve'u {ku} ca'u {ku} zdani {vau}** \\- What does it mean?\n\nAnswer:  _{wonder} {I observe!} Extending a long space from here to my front\nis a home._ or _Wow, this home extending ahead is huge!_\n\nBefore we continue with this syntax-heavy tense system, i recommend spending\nat least ten minutes doing something which doesn't occupy your brain in order\nto let the information sink in. Sing a song or eat a cookie very slowly -\nwhatever, as long as you let your mind rest.\n\n## Lesson 11: **ZAhO**\n\nThough we won't go through all Lojban tense constructs for now, there is one\nother kind of tense that I think should be taught now. These are called _event\ncontours_ , and represent a very different way of viewing tenses that we have\nseen so far. So let's get to it:\n\nUsing the tenses we have learned so far, we can imagine an indefinite time\nline, and we then place events on that line relative to the _now_. With event\ncontours, however, we view each event as a process, which has certain stages:\nA time before it unfolds, a time when it begins, a time when it is in process,\na time when it ends, and a time after it has ended. Event contours then tells\nus which part of the event's process was happening during the time specified\nby the other tenses. We need a couple of tenses first:\n\n    **pu'o** = _sumtcita: event contour: Bridi has not yet happened during {sumti_}\n    **ca'o** = _sumtcita: event contour: Bridi is in process during {sumti_}\n    **ba'o** = _sumtcita: event contour: The process of bridi has ended during {sumti_}\n\nThis needs to be demonstrated by some examples. What's **ui mi pu'o {ku} se\nzdani {vau}** mean?\n\nAnswer: _Yay, I'm about to have a home_.\n\nBut hey, you ask, why not just say **ui mi ba {ku} se zdani {vau}** and even\nsave a syllable? Because, remember, saying that you will have a home in the\nfuture says nothing about whether you have a home now. Using **pu'o** ,\nthough, you say that you are now in the past of the process of you having a\nhome, which means that you don't have one now.\n\nNote, by the way, that **mi ba {ku} se zdani {vau}** is similar to **mi pu'o\n{ku} se zdani {vau}** , and likewise with **ba'o** and **pu**. Why do they\nseem reversed? Because event contours view the present as seen from the\nviewpoint of the process, whereas the other tenses view events seen from the\npresent.\n\nOften, event contours are more precise that other kind of tenses. Even more\nclarity is achieved by combining several tenses: **.a'o mi ba {ku} zi {ku}\nba'o {ku} gunka {vau}** \\- _I hope I've soon finished working._\n\nIn Lojban, we also operate with an event's _natural beginning_ and its\n_natural end_. The term _natural_ is highly subjective in this sense, and the\nnatural end refers to the point in the process where it should end. You can\nsay about a late train, for instance, that its process of reaching you is now\nextending beyond its natural end. An undercooked, but served meal, similarly,\nis being eaten before that process' natural beginning. The event contours used\nin these examples are as follows:\n\n    **za'o** = _sumtcita: event contour: Bridi is in process beyond its natural end during {sumti_}\n    **xa'o** = _sumtcita: event contour: Bridi is immaturely in process during {sumti_}\n    **cidja** = _x 1 is food, which is edible for x2_\n\nTranslate: **.oi do citka za'o lo nu do ba'o {ku} u'e citka zo'e noi cidja do\n{vau} {ku'o} {vau} {kei} {ku}**\n\nAnswer: _Oy, you keep eating when you have finished, incredibly, eating\nsomething edible!_\n\nImage above: ZAhO tenses (event contours). All tenses above the line of the\nevent signify stages covering an amount of time. All tenses below the event\nline signify stages which are point-like.\n\nAll of these tenses have been describing stages of a process which takes some\ntime (as shown on the graph above; those tenses above the event like). But\nmany of the event contours describes point like stages in the process, like\nits beginning. As is true of **ca** and **bu'u** , they actually extend\nslightly into the past and future of that point, and need not to be precise.\n\nThe two most important point-like event contours are:\n\n    **co'a** = _sumtcita: event contour: Bridi is at its beginning during {sumti_}\n    **co'u** = _sumtcita: event contour: Bridi is at its ending during {sumti_}\n\nFurthermore, there is a point where the process is naturally complete, but not\nnecessarily has ended yet:\n\n    **mo'u** = _sumtcita: event contour: Bridi is at its natural ending during {sumti_}\n\nMost of the time, though, processes actually end at their natural ending; this\nis what makes it natural. Trains are not usually late, and people usually\nretrain themselves to eat only edible food.\n\nSince a process can be interrupted and resumed, these points have earned their\nown event contour also:\n\n    **de'a** = _sumtcita: event contour: Bridi is pausing during {sumti_}\n    **di'a** = _sumtcita: event contour: Bridi is resuming during {sumti_}\n\nIn fact, since **jundi** means _x1 pays attention to x2_ , **de'a jundi** and\n**di'a jundi** are common Lojban ways of saying _BRB_ and _back_. One could of\ncourse also say the event contours by themselves and hope the point gets\nacross.\n\nFinally, one can treat an entire event, from the beginning to the end as one\nsingle point using **co'i** :\n\n    **penmi** = _x 1 meets x2 at location x3_\n\n**mi pu {ku} zi {ku} co'i {ku} penmi lo dotco prenu {ku} {vau}** \\- _A little\nwhile ago, I was at the point in time where i met a German person_\n\n## Lesson 12: Orders and questions\n\nPhew, those two long lessons with syntax heavy Lojban gives the brain\nsomething to ponder about. Especially because it's so different from English.\nSo let's turn to something a little lighter: Orders and questions.\n\nWhat the... _sit up and focus!_\n\nSince the way to express orders in English is to leave out the subject of the\nclause, why did you assume that it was you I was speaking to, and not ordering\nmyself, or expressing the obligation someone else has? Because the English\nlanguage understands that orders, by their very nature, are always directed\ntowards the listener - the _you_ , and so the subject is not necessary.\n\nIn Lojban, eliding the subject yields **zo'e** , so that possibility is sadly\nnot open to us. Instead, we use the word **ko** , which is the imperative form\nof **do**. Grammatically and bridi-wise, it's equivalent to **do** , but it\nadds a layer of semantics, since it turns every statement with **ko** in it\ninto an order. _Do such that this sentence is true for you=**ko**!_ For the\nsame reason we don't need the subject in English sentences, we don't need\norder-words derived from any other sumti than **do**.\n\nHow could you order one to go far away for a long time (using **klama** as the\nonly selbri?)\n\nAnswer: ko ve'u ze'u klama\n\n(**.i za'a dai a'o mi ca co'u ciska lo famyma'o .i ko jimpe vau .ui**) - work\nit out. Note that\n\n    **ciska** = _x 1 writes text x2 on x3_\n\nQuestions in Lojban are very easy to learn, and they come in two kinds: Fill\nin the blank, and true/false questions. Let's begin with the true-false\nquestion kind - that's pretty overcomeable, since it only involves one word,\n**xu**.\n\n**xu** works like an attitudinal in the sense that it can go anywhere, and it\napplies to the preceding word (or construct). It then transforms the sentence\ninto a question, asking whether it is true or not. In order to affirm, you\nsimply repeat the bridi:\n\n**xu ze'u zdani do** **.i ze'u zdani mi** , or you just repeat the the selbri,\nwhich is the bridi with all the sumti and tenses elided: **zdani**.\n\nThere is an even easier way to affirm using brika'i, but those are a tale for\nanother time. To answer _no_ or _false_ , you simply answer with the bridi\nnegated. That too, will be left for later, but we will return to question\nanswering by then.\n\nThe other kind of question is fill in the blank. Here, you ask for the\nquestion word to be replaced for a construct, which makes the bridi correct.\nThere are several of these words, depending on what you are asking about:\n\n    **ma** = _sumti question_\n    **mo** = _selbri question_\n    **xo** = _number question_\n    **cu'e** = _tense question_\n\nAs well as many others. To ask about a sumti, you then just place the question\nword where you want your answer: **do dunda ma mi** \\- asks for the x2 to be\nfilled with a correct sumti. _You give what to me?_. The combination of\n**sumtcita** \\+ **ma** is very useful indeed:\n\n    **mu'i** = _sumtcita: motivated by the abstraction of {sumti_}\n\n**.oi do darxi mi mu'i ma** \\- _Oy, why do you hit me?!_\n\nLet's try another one. This time, you translate:\n\n**ui dai do ca ze'u pu mo**\n\nAnswer: _You're happy, what have you been doing all this long time until now?_\nTechnically, it could also mean _what have you been?_ , but answering with\n**ua nai li'a remna** (Uh, human, obviously) is just being incredibly annoying\non purpose.\n\nSince tone of voice or sentence structure does not reveal whether a sentence\nis a question or not, one better not miss the question word. Therefore, since\npeople tend to focus more on words in the beginning or at the end of\nsentences, it's usually worth the while to re-order the sentence so that the\nquestion words are at those places. If that is not feasable, **pau** is an\nattitudinal marking that the sentence is a question. Contrary, **pau nai**\nexplicitly marks any question as being rhetorical.\n\nWhile we are on the topic of questions, it's also appropriate to mention the\nword **kau** , which is a marker for _indirect question_. What's an indirect\nquestion, then? Well, take a look at the sentence: **mi djuno lo du'u ma kau\nzdani do** \\- _I know what is your home._\n\n    **djuno** = _x 1 knows fact(s) x2 are true about x3 by epistemology x4_\n\nOne can think it as the answer to the question **ma zdani do**. More rarely,\none can mark a non-question word with **kau** , in which case one still can\nimagine it as the answer to a question: **mi jimpe lo du'u dunda ti kau do**\n\\- _I know what you have been given, it is this._\n\n## Lesson 13: Morphology and word classes\n\nBack to more heavy (and interesting) stuff.\n\nIf you haven't already, I strongly suggest you find the Lojbanic recording\ncalled \"Story Time with Uncle Robin\", or listen to someone speak Lojban on\nMumble, and then practice your pronunciation. Having an internal conversation\nin your head in Lojban is only good if it isn't with all the wrong sounds, and\nlearning pronunciation from written text is hard. Therefore, this lesson will\nnot be on the Lojban sounds, however important they might be, but a short\nintroduction to the Lojban morphology.\n\nWhat is morphology? The word is derived from Greek meaning _the study of\nshapes_ , and in this context, we talk about how we make words from letters\nand sounds, as contrasted with syntax - how we make sentences with words.\nLojban operates with different morphological word classes, which are all\ndefined by their morphology. To make it all nice and systematic though, words\nwith certain functions tend to be grouped by morphological classes, but\nexceptions may occur.\n\nClass  | Meaning  | Defined By  | Typical Function   \n---|---|---|---  \nWords:  |  |  |   \nbrivla  | bridi-word  | Among first 5 letters (excluding _‘_) is a consonant cluster. Ends in vowel.  | Acts as a selbri by default. Always has a place structure.   \ngismu  | Root-word  | 5 letters of the form CVCCV or CCVCV  | One to five sumti places. Covers basic concepts.   \nLujvo  | Compound word. Derived from from _lujvla_ , meaning _complex word_ | Min. 6 letters. Made by stringing rafsi together with binding letters if necessary.  | Covers more complex concepts than gismu.   \nzi'evla  | Free-word  | As brivla, but do not meet defining criteria of gismu or lujvo, ex: **angeli** | Covers unique concepts like names of places or organisms.   \ncmevla  | Name-word  | Beginning and ending with pause (full stop). Last sound/letter is a consonant.  | Always acts as a name or as the content of a quote.   \ncmavo  | Grammar-word. From _cmavla_ , meaning _small word_ | One consonant or zero, always at the beginning. Ends in a vowel.  | Grammatical functions. Varies   \nWord-fragments:  |  |  |   \nrafsi  | Affix  | CCV, CVC, CV'V, -CVCCV, -CCVCV, CVCCy- or CCVCy-  | Not actual words, but can be stringed together to form lujvo   \n  \n  * **_cmevla_** are very easy to identify because they begin and end with a pause, signaled by a full stop in writing, and the last letter is a consonant. Cmevla have two functions: They can either act as a proper name, if prefixed by the article **la** (explained in next lesson), or they can act as the content of a quote. As previously stated, one can mark stress in the names by capitalizing the letters which are stressed. Examples of cmevla are: **.io'AN.** (Johan), **.mat.** (Matt) and **.cumindzyn.** (Xuming Zeng). Names which do not end in consonants have to have one added: **.anas.** (Anna), or removed: **.an.**\n  * **_brivla_** are called _bridi-words_ because they by default are selbri, and therefore almost all Lojban words with a place structure are brivla. This has also given them the English nickname _content-words_. It's nearly impossible to say anything useful without brivla, and almost all words for concepts outside lojban grammar (and even most of the words for things in the language) are captured by brivla. As shown in the table, brivla has three subcategories:\n  * **_gismu_** are the root words of the language. Only about 1450 exist, and very few new ones are added. They cover the most basic concepts like _circle_ , _friend_ , _tree_ and _dream_. Examples include **zdani** , **pelxu** and **dunda**\n  * **_lujvo_** are made by combining rafsi (see under rafsi), respresenting gismu. By combining rafsi, one narrows down the meaning of the word. lujvo are made by an elaborate algorithm, so making valid lujvo on the fly is near impossible, with few exceptions like **selpa'i** , from **se prami** , which can only have one definition. Instead, lujvo are made once, its place structure defined, and then that definition is made official by the dictionary. Examples include brivla (bridi-word), **cinjikca** (sexual-socializing = flirting) and **cakcinki** (shell-insect = beetle).\n  * **_zi'evla_** are made by making up words which fit the definition for brivla, but not for lujvo or gismu. They tend to cover concepts which it's hard to cover by lujvo, for instance names of species, nations or very cultural specific concepts. Examples include **xanguke** (South Korea) **cidjrpitsa** (pizza) or **.angeli** (angel).\n  * **_cmavo_** are small words with one or zero consonants. They tend to not signify anything in the exterior world, but to have only grammatical function. Exceptions occur, and it's debatable how much attitudinals exists for their grammatical function. Another weird example are the words of the class GOhA, which act as brivla. It is valid to type several cmavo in a row as one word, but in these lessons, that won't be done. By grouping certain cmavo in functional units, though, it is sometimes easier to read. Thus, **uipuzuvukumi citka** is valid, and is parsed and understood as **ui pu zu vu ku mi citka**. Like other Lojban words, one should (but need not always) place a full stop before any words beginning with a vowel. \n    * cmavo of the form xVV, CV'VV or V'VV are experimental, and are words which are not in the official language definition, but which have been added by Lojban users to respond to a certain need.\n  * **_rafsi_** are not Lojban words, and can never appear alone. However, several (more than one) rafsi combine to form lujvo. These must still live up to the brivla-definition, for instance **lojban** is invalid because it ends in a consonant (which makes it a cmevla), and **ci'ekei** is invalid because it does not contain a consonant cluster, and is thus read as two cmavo written as one word. Often, a 3-4 letter string is both a cmavo and a rafsi, like **zu'e** , which is both the BAI and the rafsi for **zukte**. Note that there is nowhere that both a cmavo and a rafsi would be grammatical, so these are not considered homophones. All gismu can double as (word-final) rafsi, if they are prefixed with another rafsi. The first four letter of a gismu suffixed with an \"y\" can also act as a rafsi, if they are suffixed with another rafsi. The vowel \"y\" can only appear in lujvo or cmevla. Valid rafsi letter combinations are: CVV, CV'V, CCV, CVCCy- CCVCy-, -CVCCV and -CCVCV.\n\nUsing what you know now, you should be able to answer the test I thus present:\n\nCategorize each of the following words as cmevla (C), gismu (g), lujvo (l),\n**zi'evla** (z) or cmavo (c):\n\nA ) jai  | G ) mumbl   \n---|---  \nB ) .irci  | H ) .i'i   \nC ) bostu  | I ) cu   \nD ) xelman  | J ) plajva   \nE ) po'e  | K ) danseke   \nF ) djisku  | L ) .ertsa   \n  \nAnswer: a-c, b-z, c-g, d-C, e-c, f-l, g-C, h-c, i-c, j-l, k-z, l-z. I left out\nthe full stops before and after names in order not to make the task too easy.\nNote: some of these words, like **bostu** do not exist in the dictionary, but\nthis is irrelevant. The morphology still makes it a gismu, so it's just an\nundefined gismu. Similarly with **.ertsa**\n\n## Lesson 14: Lojban sumti 1ː LE and LA\n\nIf you have read and understood the content of all the lessons until now, you\nhave amassed a large enough knowledge of Lojban so that it doesn't matter in\nwhich order you learn the rest. As a result, the order of the next lessons\nwill be a mixture of sorted by increasing difficulty and sorted by importance\nin ordinary Lojban conversation.\n\nOne of the biggest constrains on your speak now is your limited knowledge on\nhow to make sumti. So far, you only know **ti** and **lo SELBRI** , which\ndoesn't take you far considering how important sumti are in Lojban. This\nlesson as well as the following two will be about the Lojban sumti. For now,\nwe focus on the descriptive-like sumti, the ones made with articles like\n**lo**\n\nArticles are in lojban called **gadri** , and all the ones discussed in this\nlesson are terminated by **ku** , except the combination **LA CMEVLA**. We\nwill begin by describing three simple kinds of descriptive sumti, and then\nimmediately find that they are not so simple after all:\n\n    **lo** = _gadri: generic, converts selbri to sumti._\n    **le** = _gadri: specific and descriptive, converts selbri to sumti._\n    **la** = _gadri: naming article, convert selbri or cmevla to sumti._\n\nYou are already familiar with **lo** and what it does. **lo** creates a sumti\nreferring to what fits in the first place of the following selbri.\n\nThis may be contrasted with **le** , which is specific and descriptive. Saying\n**le gerku** says that you have one or more specific objects in mind, and you\nuse the selbri **gerku** to describe it, so that the listener may identify\nthose specific objects. This means that **le** has two important differences\nfrom **lo** : Firstly, it cannot refer to objects in general, but always\nrefers to specific objects. Secondly, **le gerku** explicitly hints that the\nselbri is only meant to help the speaker identify what the description refers\nto, whether or not it actually satisfies the selbri. Perhaps the speaker is\nreferring to a hyena, but is not familiar with them and thinks _dog_ is a good\nenough approximation to be understood; however, this non-veridicality is\nperhaps over-emphasized in many texts. The best way to describe a dog is\nusually to describe it as being a dog, and unless there is a good reason not\nto, **le gerku** is usually presumed to refer to something which is also **lo\ngerku**.\n\nIn translation, **lo gerku** can be any of _the dog_ , _the dogs_ , _a dog_ ,\n_some dogs_ , or _dogs in general_ , while **le gerku** is _the dog_ or _the\ndogs_. Even better for **le gerku** would be _the_ dog(s)__\n\nLast of the three basic **gadri** , there is **la** , the naming **gadri** ,\nwhich strips the following selbri of its usual meaning and refers to someone\nor something whose name is that selbri. If I in English refer to a person\ncalled Innocent by her name, I neither describe her as being innocent, nor do\nI state that she is. I only state that by convention, that object is referred\nto by that selbri or cmevla. Note that **la** and the gadri derived from it\ncan convert cmevla to sumti unlike any other **gadri**. Also: Be cautious:\nOther texts do not mention that names can be formed from ordinary selbri using\nthe gadri **la**. But those heretics must burn; selbri names are as good as\nthey get, and many a proud Lojbanist have them.\n\n**la** is a bit eccentric, since it _always_ marks the beginning of a name.\nUnlike the other gadri, anything that can be grammatically placed after **la**\nand its sisters are considered part of the name. For example, **le mi gerku**\nis \"my dog\", but **la mi gerku** is someone or something called \"My Dog\".\n\nThese three basic **gadri** can be expanded with three more, which correspond\nto the previous:\n\n    **loi** = _gadri: generic, mass of individuals_\n    **lei** = _gadri: specific and descriptive, mass of individuals_\n    **lai** = _gadri: mass of named individuals_\n\nThese are the same as the first three articles in all aspects except for one:\nthey wrap the sumti into masses. Masses are used to abstract multiple\nindividuals into single entities for ease of expression. For example, a\nfootball team can be described as a mass of its members, or an animal as a\nmass of cells.\n\n    **mivysle** = _x 1 is a biological cell of organism x2_\n    **remna** = _x 1 is a human_\n\n**loi mivysle cu remna** \\- \"Masses of cells are humans\". Again, none of the\ncells are humans. Indeed, the cells have very few human traits, but the cells\nconsidered as a whole makes up a human. This example also shows that the\nselbri following **loi** must be satisfied by the members of the mass, but not\nby the mass itself: a human isn't a cell either.\n\nA mass made with **lei** , such as **lei gerku** , refers to a mass formed by\na group of specific individuals, which the speaker refers to as **le gerku**.\n\n  \nIt needs to be noted that regular sumti built using **lo** are usually\nsufficient even when a selbri is meant to apply collectively. Constructing\nmasses is mainly necessary when talking about multiple groups of individuals.\n\n    **sruri** = _x 1 flanks/encircles/encloses x2 in line/plane/directions x3_\n\n**lo prenu cu sruri lo zdani** – **People surround the house.** The Lojban\nsentence shares the obvious meaning of the English one, namely that people are\narranged around the house, not necessarily that individual people are\nstretched around it.\n\nBut what if we want to explicitly say that people surround the house from head\nto toe? In order to be explicit about a selbri distributing across\nindividuals, one needs **lo** , **le** or **la** with an outer quantifier. The\nsubject of quantifiers will be considered later, in lesson twenty-two.\n\n  \nLastly, there are the (only two) generalizing gadri:\n\n    **lo'e** = _gadri: veridical_ convert selbri to sumti _. Sumti refers to the archetype of**lo {selbri}**._\n    **le'e** = _gadri: Descriptive_ convert selbri to sumti _. Sumti refers to the described/perceived archetype of**le {selbri}**._\n\nOf which there is no **la** -equivalent.\n\nSo, what is actually meant by the archetype? For **lo'e tirxu** , it is an\nideal, imagined big cat, which has all the properties which best exemplifies\nbig cats. It would be wrong to say that this includes having a striped fur,\nsince a big systematic subgroup of the members of the set of big cats do not\nhave striped fur, such as the leopards and the jaguars. Likewise, the typical\nhuman does not live in Asia even though a lot of humans do. However, if\nsufficiently many humans have a trait, for instance being able to speak, we\ncan say:\n\n    **kakne** = _x 1 is capable of doing/being x2 under circumstance x3_\n\n**lo'e remna cu kakne lo nu tavla** \\- _The typical human being can speak_.\n\n**le'e** then, is the ideal object as perceived or described by the speaker.\nThis need not be factually correct, and is often translated as the\n_stereotype_ , even though the English phrase have some unpleasant negative\nconnotations, which the Lojban does not. In fact, everyone has a stereotypical\narchetypichal image of any category. In other words, **lo'e remna** is the\narchetype which best exemplifies all **lo remna** , while the archetype **le'e\nremna** best exemplifies all **le remna**.\n\nThe eleven gadri can be seen in the diagram below.\n\n| Generic  | Masses  | Generalizing   \n---|---|---|---  \nVeridical  | lo  | loi  | lo'e   \nDescriptive  | le  | lei  | le'e   \nName  | la  | lai  | does not exist   \n  \nNote: Earlier, there was a word **xo'e** for the generic gadri. However, the\nrules and definitions for gadri were changed in late 2004, and the current set\nof rules on this topic, nicked _xorlo_ has replaced the old way. Now, **lo**\nis generic, and **xo'e** is used as an elliptical digit (lesson nineteen).\nThere are also gadri for building sets (**lo'i** , **le'i** , **la'i**), but\nthey are exceedingly rare in post-xorlo usage.\n\n## Lesson 15: Lojban sumti 2ː KOhA3, KOhA5 and KOhA6\n\nSee what happens if I try to translate the sentence: _Stereotypical people who\ncan speak Lojban speak to each other about the languages they can speak_ :\n\n    **bangu** = _x 1 is a language used by x2 to express x3 (abstraction)_\n\n**le'e prenu poi ke'a kakne lo nu tavla fo la .lojban. cu tavla le'e prenu poi\nke'a kakne lo nu tavla fo la .lojban. lo bangu poi lo prenu poi ke'a tavla fo\nla .lojban. cu se bangu ke'a**\n\nWhat we see is that the Lojban version is much longer than the English. This\nis primarily because the first, ridiculously long sumti is being repeated two\nmore times in the Lojban text, while the English can refer to it by _each\nother_ and _they_ \\- much more efficiently. Wouldn't it be clever if Lojban\nsomehow had mechanisms for doing the same?\n\nIt turns out it does, what a surprise! Lojban has a range of words called\n**sumka'i** meaning _sumti-representatives_. In English, we refer to them as\npro-sumti, because they are essentially the same as the English pronouns, but\nwith sumti instead of nouns. In fact, you already know **ti** , **do** and\n**mi** , but there are many more, so let's get learning. First, we want to put\nit into system. We can begin with the ones most familiar to English, and what\nyou've already learned:\n\n    **ti** = _sumka'i:_ immediate ‘it': represents a sumti physically near the speaker'****\n    **ta** = _sumka'i:_ nearby ‘it': represents a sumti some physical distance from the speaker OR close to the listener'****\n    **tu** = _sumka'i:_ distant ‘it': represents a sumti physically far from the speaker and the listener.'****\n\nYou can again recognize the _i, a, u_ -sequence which pops up over and over.\nSome things might take some clearing up, though. Firstly, these sumti can\nrepresent anything which can be said to occupy a physical space. Objects,\ncertainly. Ideas, certainly not. Events are accepted, but only to the extent\nthey are restricted to a specific place - the Jasmin Revolution cannot be\npointed at, but some bar-fight or a kiss might. Secondly, note that the\ndistance is relative to different things for the different words: **tu** only\napplies if it's distant from both the speaker and the listener. In cases where\nthe speaker and listener is far apart and the listener cannot see the speaker\ntalking, **ta** refers to something close to the listener. Thirdly, it's all\nrelative and context dependent. These three words are all problematic in\nwritten text, for instance, because the position of the speaker and listener\nis unknown to each other, and changes as time goes by. Furthermore, the author\nof a book cannot point to an object and express the pointing in the book.\n\nThen there is a series called KOhA3, to which **mi** and **do** (and **ko** ,\nbut I won't write that here) belongs:\n\n    **mi** = _sumka'i: The speaker(s)._\n    **mi'o** = _sumka'i: The mass of the speaker(s) and the listener(s) ._\n    **mi'a** = _sumka'i: The mass of the speaker(s) and others._\n    **ma'a** = _sumka'i: The mass of the speaker(s), the listener(s) and others._\n    **do** = _sumka'i: The listener(s)._\n    **do'o** = _sumka'i: The mass of the listener(s) and others._\n\nThese six sumka'i are more easily grasped in the below Venn diagram:\n\nVenn diagram of KOhA3 (**ko** excluded). **le drata** is not a KOhA3, but\nmeans _the other(s)_\n\nIt is possible for several people to be _the speakers_ , if one statement is\nmade on the behalf of all of them. Therefore, while _we_ can be translated as\neither **mi** , **mi'o** , **mi'a** or **ma'a** , what one quite often means\nis really just **mi**. All of these six, if they refer to more than one\nindividual, represent masses. Within bridi-logic, the bridi **mi gleki** said\nby speaker A is exactly equivalent to **do gleki** said by speaker B to\nspeaker A, and are considered the same bridi. We will come back to this later,\nin the **brika'i** (pro-bridi) lesson.\n\nAll of these **sumka'i** are very content-specific, and cannot be used, for\ninstance, to help us with the sentence which this lesson began with. The\nfollowing series can in principle be used to refer to any sumti:\n\n    **ri** = _sumka'i:_ Last sumti mentioned'****\n    **ra** = _sumka'i:_ A recent, but not the last sumti mentioned'****\n    **ru** = _sumka'i:_ A sumti mentioned long ago'****\n\nThese sumti will refer to any terminated sumti except most other **sumka'i**.\nThe reason that most other **sumka'i** cannot be referred to by these sumti,\nis that they are so easy to just repeat by themselves. The exception to the\nrule are **ti** , **ta** and **tu** , because you could have changed what you\npoint at, and thus cannot just repeat the word. (There are some other\nexceptions, to be handled later.) They will only refer to terminated sumti,\nand thus cannot, for instance, be used to refer to an abstraction if the word\nin is that abstraction: **le pendo noi ke'a pendo mi cu djica lo nu ri se\nzdani** \\- here **ri** cannot refer to the abstration, since it is not\nterminated, nor to **mi** or **ke'a** , since they are sumka'i, so it refers\nto **le pendo**.\n\n**ra** and **ru** are context-dependent in what they refer to, but they follow\nthe rules mentioned above, and **ru** always refer to a more distant sumti\nthan **ra** , which is always more distant than **ri**.\n\n**ri** and it's brothers are pretty well suited for dealing with the original\nsentence. Try saying it using two instances of **sumka'i**!\n\nAnswer: **le'e prenu poi ke'a kakne lo nu tavla fo la .lojban. cu tavla ru lo\nbangu poi ru cu se bangu ke'a**. **ri** is not correct, because it refers to\n**la .lojban.**. **ra** could be used, but could be mistakenly be thought to\nrefer to **lo nu tavla fo la .lojban.** , but **ru** is assumed to refer to\nthe most distant sumti - the most outer one.\n\nLastly, there a sumtcita which represent utterances: So called utterance\nvariables. They need not be restricted to one sentence (jufra), but can be\nseveral sentences, if the context allows it:\n\n    **da'u** = _Utterance variable: Remote past sentence_\n    **de'u** = _Utterance variable: Recent sentence_\n    **di'u** = _Utterance variable: Previous sentence_\n    **dei** = _Utterance variable: This sentence_\n    **di'e** = _Utterance variable: Next sentence_\n    **de'e** = _Utterance variable: Near future sentence_\n    **da'e** = _Utterance variable: Remote future sentence_\n    **do'i** = _Utterance variable: Elliptical utterance variable: Some sentence_\n\nThese represents sentences as sumti, and refer only to the spoken words or the\nletters, not to the meaning behind them.\n\nThere are more Lojban **sumka'i** , but for now you probably need a break from\nthem. The next lesson will be on derived sumti, sumti made from other sumti.\n\n## Lesson 16: Lojban sumti 3ː derived sumti\n\nYou can probably see that the sumti **le bangu poi mi se bangu ke'a** is a\nless than elegant expression for _my language_. This is because it's really a\nwork around. A language which I speak can be said to fill into the x1 of the\nbridi **bangu mi**. We can't convert that to a sumti using a gadri: **le bangu\n{ku} mi** is two sumti, because **bangu mi** is a bridi, not a selbri. Neither\ncan we convert it using **le su'u** , because the su'u gives the bridi a new\nx1, the abstraction, and the **le** then extracts that. That makes an\nabstraction sumti meaning something like _that something is my language_.\n\nEnter **be**. **be** is a word which binds constructs (sumti, sumtcita and\nothers) to a selbri. Using it in ordinary selbri has no effect: in **mi nelci\nbe do** , the **be** does nothing. However, when a sumti is bound to a selbri\nthis way, you can use a gadri on the selbri without the sumti splitting off:\n**le bangu be mi** is a correct solution to the problem above. Likewise, you\ncan attach a sumtcita: **le jinga be gau do** : _The one who wins because of\nyou_.\n\nWhat if I want to attach several sumti to a selbri inside a gadri? _The giver\nof the apple to you_ is **le dunda be lo plise be do** , right? Nope. The\nsecond **be** attaches to the apple, meaning **le plise be do** \\- _The apple\nof the strain of you_ , which makes no sense. In order to string several sumti\nto a selbri, the all the ones following the first must be bound with **bei**.\nThe _binding_ can be terminated with **be'o** \\- one instance of **be'o** for\neach selbri which has sumti bound by **be**.\n\nTo list them:\n\n    **be** = _binds sumti or sumtcita to selbri_\n    **bei** = _binds a second, third, fourth (ect) sumti or sumtcita to a selbri_\n    **be'o** = _ends binding to selbri_\n\nThere is also ways to loosely associate a sumti with another. **pe** and\n**ne** for restrictive and non-restrictive association. Actually, **le bangu\npe mi** is a better translation of _my language_ , since this phrase, like the\nEnglish, is vague as to how the two are associated with each other.\n\n**pe** and **ne** are used as loose association only, like saying _my chair_\nabout a chair which you sit on. It's not really yours, but has something do to\nwith you. A more intimate connection can be established with **po** , which\nmakes the association unique and binding to a person, as in _my car_ for a car\nthat you actually own. The last kind of associator is **po'e** , which makes a\nso-called \"inalienable\" bond between sumti, meaning that the bond is innate\nbetween the two sumti. Some examples could be \"my mother\", \"my arm\" or \"my\nhome country\"; none of these \"possesions\" can be lost (even if you saw off\nyour arm, it's still _your_ arm), and are therefore inalienable. Almost all of\nthe times a **po'e** is appropriate, though, the x2 of the selbri contains the\none to which the x1 is connected, so **be** is better.\n\n    **ne** = _non-restrictive relative phrase. \"which is associated with...\"_\n    **pe** = _restrictive relative phrase. \"which is associated with...\"_\n    **po** = _possesive relative phrase. \"which is specific to...\"_\n    **po'e** = _inalienable relative phrase. \"which belongs to...\"_\n\nA very useful construct to know is **{gadri} {sumti} {selbri}**. this is\nequivalent to **{gadri} {selbri} pe {sumti}**. For instance **le mi gerku** is\nequivalent to **le gerku pe mi**. One could have description sumti inside\ndescription sumti, saying **le le se cinjikca be mi ku gerku** , = **le gerku\npe le se cinjikca be mi** =_the dog of the man I'm flirting with_ , but that's\nnot very easy to read (or to understand when spoken), and is often being\navoided.\n\nOne need also to learn **tu'a** , since it will make a lot of sentences much\neasier. It takes a sumti and converts it to another sumti - an elliptical\nabstraction which has something to do with the first sumti. For example, I\ncould say **mi djica lo nu mi citka lo plise** , or I could let it be up to\ncontext what abstraction about the apple I desire and just say **mi djica tu'a\nlo plise**. One always has to guess what abstraction the speaker means by\n**tu'a SUMTI** , so it should only be used when context makes it easy to\nguess. Another example:\n\n    **gasnu** = _x 1 does/brings about x2 (volition not implied)_\n\n**za'a do gasnu tu'a lo skami** \\- _I see that you make the computer do\nsomething_. Officially, **tu'a SUMTI** is equivalent to **le su'u SUMTI\nco'e**. Vague, but useful. There are situations where you cannot use **tu'a**\n, even though it would seem suitable. These situations are when I don't want\nthe resulting sumti to be an abstraction, but a concrete sumti. In this case,\none can use **zo'e pe**.\n\n    **tu'a** = _convert sumti to vague abstraction involving the sumti. Equivalent to**le su'u SUMTI co'e kei ku**_\n\nFinally, one kind of sumti can be turned into another by the words of the\nclass LAhE.\n\n    **lu'a** = _Convert individual(s)/mass/sequence/set to individuals._\n    **lu'i** = _Convert individual(s)/mass/sequence/set to a set._\n    **lu'o** = _Convert individual(s)/mass/sequence/set to mass._\n    **vu'i** = _Convert individual(s)/mass/sequence/set to sequence; the order is not stated._\n\nThe use of these words is straight-forwardly: Placing them before a sumti of a\ncertain type makes a new sumti of a new type. Notice, though, that as a fourth\nkind of sumti, a sequence has been introduced. This is not used very often (it\ndoesn't have its own gadri, for instance), but just included here for\ncompletion.\n\nThe last two members of LAhE do not convert between types of sumti, but allows\nyou to speak of a a sumti by only mentioning something which references to it:\n\nIf one sumti A refers to a sumti B, for instance because sumti A is a title of\na book, or a name, or a sentence (which always refer to something, at least a\nbridi), **la'e SUMTI A** refers to sumti B. For instance, **mi nelci la'e\ndi'u** for _I like what you just said_ (not **mi nelci di'u** which just means\n_I like your previous sentence_) or **la'e le cmalu noltru** for the book _The\nLittle Prince_ , and not some little prince himself. The cmavo **lu'e** does\nthe exact reverse – **lu'e SUMTI** refers to an object which refers to the\nsumti.\n\n    **la'e** = _\"the thing referred to by\" - extracts a sumti A from a sumti B which refers to A._\n    **lu'e** = _\"the thing referring to\" - extracts a sumti B from a sumti A, when B refers to A._\n\n## Lesson 17: Cute assorted words\n\nAnd with that, third chapter, you know a lot about Lojban sumti. After such a\nlong time of rigorous systematic learning, what could be more fitting that\nthis lesson where I speak about some words which I could not, or wanted not to\nfit into any other lessons? So here are a few small and really useful words:\n\nThe following cmavo are all elliptical words. You should already be familiar\nwith the first.\n\n    **zo'e** = _elliptical sumti_\n    **co'e** = _elliptical selbri_\n    **do'e** = _elliptical sumtcita_\n    **ju'a** = _elliptical evidential_\n    **do'i** = _elliptical utterance variable_\n    **ge'e** = _elliptical attitudinal_\n\nAll of these act grammatically as a cmavo of the kind they represent, but they\ncontain no information, and can be quite handy when you're lazy and don't need\nto be specific anyway. There are, however, a few things which need to be\ncleared up:\n\n  * **zo'e** have to refer to something which is claimed to have a value. _zero cars_ or _nothing_ , for instance, has no value, and therefore cannot be referred to by **zo'e**. This is because, if it could mean _nothing_ by **zo'e** , then any selbri could be identical to its negation, if one of the elided sumti were filled with a **zo'e** with no value.\n  * **ge'e** does not mean that you feel no emotion, just that you feel nothing special or worth to mention at the moment. It's similar to _I'm fine._. **ge'e pei** ask about an elliptical emotion and is a good translation for: _How are you feeling?_.\n  * **co'e** is handy when needing a selbri in a construct for grammatical reasons, like in the definition of **tu'a** in the previous lesson.\n  * **ju'a** does not change the truth value or subjective understanding of the bridi or anything like that. In fact, it's mostly does nothing. However, **ju'a pei** , _What is your basis for saying that?_ is handy.\n  * **do'i** is really useful. A lot of times when you refer to utterances or conversations by words like _this_ or _that_ , you want **do'i**.\n  * If you fill in more sumti than a selbri has places for, the last sumti have implied **do'e** sumtcita in front of them.\n\nFurthermore, there is a word, **zi'o** , that you can fill a sumti place with\nto delete it from any selbri. **lo melbi be zi'o** , for instance, is just\n_Something beautiful_ , and does not include the usual x2 of **melbi** , which\nis the observer who judges something to be beautiful. Thus, it can mean\nsomething like _Objectively beautiful._ It does not state that nothing fills\nthe sumti place which is being deleted, just that the sumti place is not being\nconsidered in the selbri. Using **zi'o** with a sumtcita gives weird results.\nFormally, they should cancel each other out. Practically, it would probably be\nunderstood as an explicit way of saying that the sumtcita does not apply, as\nin: **mi darxi do mu'i zi'o** \\- _I hit you, with or without motivation._\n\nThen there is the word **jai**. It's one of those cool, small words which are\nhard to grasp, but easy to work with once you know it. It has two distinct,\nbut similar functions. Both have something to do with converting the selbri,\nlike **se** does.\n\n    **jai** = _Selbri conversion: Converts sumtcita or unspecified abstraction to x 1. Use with **fai**_\n\n    **fai** = _Marks sumti place. Works like**fa**. To be used with **jai**._\n\nThe first grammatical construction it can make is \"**jai** {sumtcita}\n{selbri}\". It changes the sumti places such that the sumti place of the\nsumtcita becomes the selbri's x1, and the selbri's old x1 is removed, and only\naccessible by using **fai** , which works like **fa**. You can see it with\nthis example:\n\n    **gau** = _sumtcita (from**gasnu**) _bridi has been brought about by/with active agent {sumti}'****\n\n**do jai gau jundi ti fai mi**. - _You bring about attention to this by me_.\nThe new selbri, **jai gau jundi** , has the place structure of _x1 brings\nabout attention paid to x2_. These are then filled by **do** and **ti**. The\n**fai** then marks the place for the old x1, the one who was paying attention,\nand it is filled with **mi**. This word can be very convenient and has tons of\nuses. A good example is descriptive-like sumti. One can, for instance, refer\nto _the method of volitional action_ by **lo jai ta'i zukte**.\n\n    **ta'i** = _sumtcita (from**tadji**): Bridi is done with the method of {sumti_}\n\nCan you deduce what the ordinary Lojban phrase **do jai gau mo** means?\n\nAnswer: _What are you doing?_\n\nThe other function of **jai** is easier to explain. It simply converts the\nselbri such that the sumti in the x1 gets a **tu'a** in front of it (**ko'a\njai broda** = **tu'a ko'a broda**). In other words, it converts the selbri in\na way such that it builds an elliptical abstraction from the sumti in the x1,\nand then fills x1 with the abstraction instead of the actual sumti. Again, the\noriginal sumti place is accessible by **fai**.\n\nA very active Lojban IRC-user often says **le gerku pe do jai se stidi mi** ,\nto use a random example of a sumti in x1. What's he saying?\n\n    **stidi** = _x 1 inspires/suggests x2 in/to x3_\n\nAnswer: _I suggest (something about) your dog._\n\nSo far you've learned how to convert bridi to selbri, selbri to sumti, and\nselbri into bridi, since all selbri by themselves are also bridi. You only\nneed one last function: convert sumti to selbri. This is done with the word\n**me**. It accepts a sumti and converts it into a selbri.\n\n    **me** = _Generic convert sumti to selbri. x 1 is/are among the referents of SUMTI_\n\nWhen screwing a sentence up, knowing how to correct yourself is a good idea.\nThere are three words in Lojban which you can use to delete your previous\nword(s)\n\n    **si** = _deletion: Deletes last word only._\n    **sa** = _deletion: Deletes back until next cmavo spoken._\n    **su** = _deletion: Deletes entire discourse._\n\nThe function of these words are obvious: They delete words as if they have\nnever been spoken. They do not work inside certain quotes (all quotes except\n**lu...li'u**), though, as that would leave it impossible to quote these\nwords. Several **si** in a row deletes several words\n\n## Lesson 18: Quotes\n\nOne of the key design features of Lojban is that it's supposed to be audio-\nvisual isomorphic, meaning that everything expressed in text should also be\nexpressed in speech and vice versa. Therefore, there cannot be any punctuation\nwhich is not pronounced. This means that Lojban has a wide range of words to\nquote other words. All Lojban quotes take some input of text and converts it\nto a sumti. Let's begin with the most simple:\n\n    **lu** = _Quote word: Begin quote of grammatical Lojban content_\n    **li'u** = _Quote word: End quote of grammatical Lojban content_\n\nThe text inside this construct must by itself be grammatical. It can quote all\nLojban words with some few exceptions, most notably, obviously, **li'u**.\n\nTry to translate the following sentence. Take your time.\n\n**mi stidi lo drata be tu'a lu ko jai gau mo li'u**\n\n    **drata** = _x 1 is different from x2 by standard_\n\nAnswer: _I suggest something different than something about**ko jai gau mo**._\n\nThese quote words cannot quote ungrammatical text. This is sometimes useful,\nwhen you want to only pick out part of a sentence, as in: _is**gi'e** a Lojban\nsumtcita?_\n\nFor this, you need these two cmavo\n\n    **lo'u** = _Quote word: Begin quote of ungrammatical but Lojban content_\n    **le'u** = _Quote word: End quote of ungrammatical but Lojban content_\n\nThe text inside must be Lojban words, but need not be grammatical. Try to\ntranslate the above example (the one with **gi'e**) into Lojban\n\nAnswer: **xu lo'u gi'e le'u lojbo sumtcita**\n\nThis quote can be used to quote all Lojban words except **le'u**. However,\nthis is not enough. If we want to translate _is**do mo** a correct translation\nof \"What's up?\"_, we might be slightly wrong about what we here state, since\n**do mo** also can mean _What are you?_ , but let's roll with it for a second.\nWhat we need here is the word **zoi**.\n\n    **zoi** = _Next cmavo starts all-purpose quote and closes all-purpose quote._\n\nWhen using **zoi** , you pick any morphologically correct lojban word at will\n(called the delimiter), which then opens a quote. To close it, use that word\nagain. This way, you can quote anything except the delimiter, which shouldn't\nbe a problem because you can pick it yourself. Usually, the word picked is\neither **zoi** itself, or a letter which stands for the language which the\nquote is written in. Example: _I liked The Phantom of the Opera_ is **mi pu\nnelci la'e zoi zoi. The Phantom of the Opera .zoi** Notice two things:\nFirstly, I need a **la'e** , since I didn't like the quote, but rather what it\nreferred to. Secondly, between the chosen delimiter and the quote, there are\npauses, optionally represented by a full stop in writing. This pause is\nnecessary to correctly identify the delimiter.\n\nTry to translate the above sentence concerning _What's up?_\n\n    **drani** = _x 1 is correct/proper in aspect x2 in situation x3 by standard x4_\n\nAnswer: **xu lu do mo li'u drani xe fanva zoi gy. What's up? .gy**. Here the\ndelimiter **gy** is chosen because it's short for **glico** , meaning\n\"English\"\n\nClosely analogously, there is **la'o**. It works exactly like **zoi** , but\nturns the resulting quote into a name. It is needed because normally, only\nselbri and cmevla can be names, not quotes.\n\n    **la'o** = _Next cmavo is begin all-purpose quote and close all-purpose quote – use as name._\n\nLast of the official quote words, there is **zo**. **zo** always quotes the\nnext Lojban word, no matter what it is. It's pretty handy.\n\n    **zo** = _quotes next Lojban word, no matter what._\n\nExample:\n\n**zo zo zo'o plixau**  \n _\"zo\" is useful, hehe._  \n---  \n  \n    **zo'o** = _attitudinal: discursive: Humorously, \"kidding you\"_\n    **plixau** = _x 1 is useful for x2 to do purpose x3_\n\nSome Lojban users have found it useful to supplement with four additional\nquote words. The most used is:\n\n**u'i ri pu cusku zo'oi Doh**  \n _Ha ha, he said \"Doh!\"_  \n---  \n  \n    **zo'oi** = _Quote next word only. Next word is identified by pauses in speech or whitespace/dot in writing:_\n\nIt is apparently very easy to use, but as a matter of fact, general use of\nthem is very problematic. Users should be aware that the word following\n**zo'oi** should not include a period, a glottal stop or a pause. For example,\n*** zo'oihttp://www.lojban.org/** is not grammatical since the string\n\"http://www.lojban.org/\" contains periods.\n\nAnother erratic text: *** lo salpo (ku) fa'u lo finti cu smuni zo'oi saka fa'u\nzo'oi sa.ka lo ponjo**. Here \"sa.ka\" has a period inside.\n\nAnalogous to **zo'oi** and **la'o** , there is also the word **la'oi** , which\nworks just like **zo'oi** , but forms a sumti that refers to something called\n(whatever next words is put):\n\n    **la'oi** = _Scope over the next word only; \"something called by the name...\". Next word is identified by pauses in speech or whitespace/dot in writing._\n\nHow would you say: _\"Safi\" is an English guy. It's his name_?\n\n    **glico** = _x 1 is English/pertains to English culture in aspect x2_\n    **cmene** = _x 1 is the name of x2 as used by x3_\n\nAnswer: **la'oi Safi glico .i lu'e ri cmene ri**\n\n**la'oi** has the same problem as **zo'oi** : the word following **la'oi**\nshould not include a period, a glottal stop or a pause. For example, the\nfollowing sentences are not grammatical:\n\n  * **.u'a mi te vecnu lo zgike datni pe la'oi t.A.T.u**. Here \"t.A.T.u\" has periods inside (\"t.A.T.u\" was a musical group).\n\nExample of spoken text: **la'oi .uli.uli zgike tutci**. \"`uli`uli\" is a\nHawaiian musical instrument. This word has periods inside.\n\nExample of spoken text: **ju'i la'oi\njugemujugemugokounosurikirekaijarisuigiono-\nsuigioumatsu,unraimatsufuuraimatsuku,unerutokoronisumutokoro,iaburakoujinoburakouji-\npaipopaipopaiponosiu,uringansiu,uringan,nogu,urindaigu,urindainoponpokopi,inoponpokona,anotcoukiu,umeinotcousuke\nmi'o ko'oi klama lo ckule**. Don't take a breathing in the name, or it will\nresult in an _error_! This word\n(\"じゅげむじゅげむごこうのすりきれかいじゃりすいぎょのすいぎょうまつうんらいまつふうらいまつくうねるところにすむところやぶらこうじのぶらこうじぱいぽぱいぽぱいぽのしゅーりんがんしゅーりんがんのぐーりんだいぐーりんだいのぽんぽこぴーのぽんぽこなーのちょうきゅうめいのちょうすけ\")\nis a famous Japanese name of a boy.)\n\nThirdly, **ra'oi** quotes the next rafsi. Since rafsi are not words, they\nwould usually have to be quoted by **zoi**. Furthermore, several rafsi are\nalso cmavo. To avoid confusion of which is meant, **ra'oi** always refer to a\nrafsi, and is wrong in front of any text string which are not rafsi.\n\nWhat does **ra'oi zu'e rafsi zo zukte .i ku'i zo'oi zu'e sumtcita** mean?\n\n    **ku'i** = _attitudinal: discursive: However / though (contrasts to something previously said)_\n    **rafsi** = _x 1 an affix for word/concept x2 with properties/of form x3 in language x4_\n\nAnswer: _The rafsi**zu'e** is a rafsi for **zukte**. But **zu'e** is a\nsumtcita._\n\nAnd finally the useful word **ma'oi**. **ma'oi** quotes any cmavo, but treats\nthe quote as a name for the word class (selma'o) to which that word belongs.\nSo, for instance, **ba'o** belongs to the wordclass called ZAhO, so **ma'oi\nba'o** is unofficial Lojban for the selmaho **ZahO**.\n\nTry it out. Say that **pu** and **ba** are in the same selma'o!\n\n    **cmavo** = _x 1 is a grammatical word of class x2 in language x3_\n\nOne possible answer: **zo pu cmavo ma'oi ba**\n\n## Lesson 19: Numbers\n\nWhen learning a language, one of the things which are usually taught very\nearly on is how to count. This really makes little sense, because it's not\nnecessary to know numbers if you don't know how to speak about those things to\nwhich they apply. This is partly the reason why I have left it for lesson\nnumber nineteen. The other reason is that while the numbers themselves are\neasy to learn, how they apply to sumti can get very confusing indeed. That,\nhowever, we will save for a later lesson.\n\nBefore learning the words themselves, you should know that numbers do not have\nany internal grammar. This means that any row of number words (henceforth\nreferred to as a \"number string\") are treated identically to any other number\nstring to the Lojban grammar, even if the string makes no sense. Therefore,\none can never answer unambiguously whether a number construct makes sense or\nnot. There are, however, intended ways of using the number words, and\nconfusion will probably result if you deviate from the standard.\n\nLearning all the number words of Lojban are way beyond the scope of this\nlesson, so you will only be introduced to what is normally used in text. The\nwide range of Lojban mathematical cmavo are called **mekso** (Lojban for\n\"mathematical expression\"), and is widely disregarded because of its\ncomplexity and questionable advantage over so-called bridi math.\n\nLet's begin with the ordinary Lojban numbers, from zero to nine:\n\nNotice how the vowels are alternating (with the exception of **no**), and how\nno consonant is used for two digits. In order to express numbers higher than\nnine, the numbers are just strung together:\n\n  * **vo mu ci** – four hundred and fifty three (453)\n  * **pa no no no no** ten thousand (10 000)\n\nThere is also a _question-digit_ , which is used like other fill-in-the-blank\nquestion words. It's **xo**. The answer to such a question may be just the\nrelevant digit(s) by itself, or they can be numerical constructs, as shown\nlater.\n\n  * **ci xo xo xo** – \"Three thousand and how many?\" (3???)\n\n    **xo** = _question digit – use like any other digit to ask for the correct digit._\nThe experimental word **xo'e** is sometimes used to mean an unspecified,\nelliptical digit. Its definition is not official, though.\n\n  * **ci xo'e xo'e xo'e** – Three thousand and something\n\n    **xo'e** = _elliptical digit._\nSince all number strings are treated grammatically the same, one might also answer several digits to one **xo'e** Furthermore, there is also a set of hexadecimal digits A through F. By default, Lojban operates in base 10, but when using hexadecimal digits, it can be safely assumed that you use base sixteen:  dau  | fei  | gai  | jau  | rei  | xei  | vai   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n10(A)  | 11(B)  | 12(C)  | 13(D)  | 14(E)  | 14(E)  | 15(F)   \n  \n  \nYes, I know there are two words for E. The official one is **rei** (all three-\nletter cmavo beginning with x is experimental). **xei** was invented to avoid\nconfusion with **re**.\n\nThe base can be explicitly stated using **ju'u** : Any number before **ju'u**\nthe number being spoken of, any number after is the base of the number:\n\n  * **dau so fei no ju'u pa re** – A9B0 in base 12 (notice here that base 12 is always in decimal. It is possible to permanently change the base you speak in, but since it has never been used in practice, it has not been standardized how one should do it)\n\nFractions are also useful to learn how to express. They are usually expressed\nvia a decimal point, **pi**.\n\n    **pi** = _Decimal point (or point in whichever base you are talking in)_\n\n**pa re pi re mu** – twelve point two five (12.25).\n\nLike in mathematics, when no number string is placed before or after **pi** ,\nzero is assumed.\n\nRelated to this, the number separator **pi'e** is used to separate numbers,\neither to separate digits when speaking in a base larger than sixteen, or when\na decimal point is not applicable, for instance, when talking about time in\nhours, minutes, seconds:\n\n**pa so pi'e re mu pi'e no ju'u re ze** – Nineteen, twenty-five, zero in base\n27 (JP0 base 27)\n\n**re re pi'e vo bi** – twenty-two, fourty eight (22:48)\n\nThere is also a range of number words which are not mathematically exact but\nrather subjective or relative. The behaviors of these words are almost exactly\nlike the behavior of digits, except they cannot be combined to make bigger\nnumbers the way digits can:\n\nro  | so'a  | so'e  | so'i  | so'o  | so'u   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nall  | almost all  | most  | many  | some  | few   \n  \n  \n\nWhen combined with any of the digits, these words are assumed to give a second\nverdict about the size of the number:\n\n**mu bi so'i sai** – Fifty eight, which is really many.\n\nThey should therefore not be placed in the middle of a number string. When\nplaced after **pi** , they are assumed to convey the size of a fraction:\n\n  * **pi so'u** – a small part of it\n  * **pi so'o** – some of it\n  * **pi so'i** – a large part of it\n  * **pi so'e** – most of it\n  * **pi so'a** – almost all of it\n\nThese are some hightly subjective numbers - they work just like the previous\nones.\n\ndu'e  | mo'a  | rau   \n---|---|---  \ntoo many  | too few  | enough   \n  \n  \n\nThe following five are context-based numbers – these work like the previous\nones, with the exception that they take the next number in order to assign\nthem meaning:\n\nda'a  | su'e  | su'o  | za'u  | me'i   \n---|---|---|---|---  \nall except n  | At most n  | At least n  | more than n  | less than n   \n  \nIf no number string follow them, _one_ is assumed.\n\n**so'i pa re da'a mu** – Many, which is twelve, which is all but five.\n\nThe two last number words you should know have slightly more complicated\ngrammar:\n\n    **ji'i** = _number rounding or number approximation_\n\nWhen **ji'i** is placed before a number, the entire number is approximated:\n\n**ji'i ze no za'u rau ju'o** – \"About seventy, which is more than enough,\ncertainly __\n\nPlaced in the middle of the number, only the following digits are non-exact.\nAt the end of a number, it signifies that the number has been rounded off.\n\n    **ki'o** = _Number comma - separates digits within one string; Thousands._\n\nIt is not incidential that **ki'o** sounds like _kilo_. At its simplest,\n**ki'o** is used to separate three digits at a time in large numbers, much\nlike commas are used in English:\n\n**pa ki'o so so so ki'o bi xa ze** – 1,999,867\n\nIf less than three digits are put before a **ki'o** , the digits are assumed\nto be the least significant ones, and zeros are assumed to fill in the rest:\n\n**vo ki'o ci bi ki'o pa ki'o ki'o** – 4,038,001,000,000\n\n**ki'o** is used similarly after a decimal point.\n\nThat concludes the common Lojban numbers themselves. How they apply to sumti\nis a science in itself, and we leave that for lesson twenty-two. Now we focus\non how these numbers can be used in a bridi.\n\nA string of number words by themselves are grammatical, since they can act as\nan answer to a **xo** -type of question. In this case, however, they cannot be\nconsidered part of any bridi. In general, if numbers fill part of a bridi,\nthey do so in one of two forms: Pure numbers and quantifiers. We will return\nto quantifiers in a later lesson. For now, we will look at pure numbers.\n\nA pure number is any row of number words prefixed with **li**. This makes a\nsumti directly from the number, and refers to the mathematical concept of, for\ninstance, _the number six_. Its famyma'o is **lo'o**\n\n    **li** = _convert number/mekso-expression to sumti._\n\n    **lo'o** = _famyma'o: end convert number/mekso-expression to sumti._\n\nThese pure sumti are usually what fills the x2 of brivla such as **mitre** or\n**cacra**\n\n    **mitre** = _x 1 is x2 metres in dimension x3 by standard x4_\n\n    **cacra** = _x 1 is x2 hours in duration (default 1) by standard x3_\n\nTry to translate the following:\n\n**le ta nu cinjikca cu cacra li ci ji'i u'i nai**\n\nAnswer: _(sigh) That flirting has been going on for around three hours._\n\nHow do you count to three in Lojban?\n\nAnswer: **li pa li re li ci**\n\nThe last thing we'll go through in this lesson is the words of the selma'o MAI\nand those of MOI.\n\nMAI only contains two words, **mai** and **mo'o**. Both of these convert any\nnumber string to an ordinal, which has the grammar of attitudinals. Ordinals\nare used to divide a text into numbered segments, like chapters or parts. The\nonly difference between **mai** and **mo'o** is that **mo'o** quantifies\nlarger subdivisions of text, allowing you to divide a text on two different\nlevels, for example enumerating chapters with **mo'o** and sections with\n**mai**. Notice that these as well as the MOI take any number string directly,\nwithout any need for **li**.\n\n    **mai** = _Lower-order ordinal marker: Convert number to ordinal._\n    **mo'o** = _Higher order ordinal marker: Convert number to ordinal._\n\nThere are five MOI, and they all convert any number string to selbri. We'll\ntake them one at a time:\n\n    **moi** = _Convert number n to selbri: x 1 is the n'th member of set x2 by order x3_\n\nExample:\n\n**la lutcimin ci moi lo'i ninmu pendo be mi le su'u lo clani zmadu cu lidne lo\nclani mleca**  \n _Lui-Chi Min is third among my female friends by the order: The more tall\nones precedes the less tall ones._  \n---  \n  \nWhen specifying a sequence, it is widely understood that if a **ka**\n-abstraction (lesson thirty) is used as a sumti, the members of the set are\nordered from the one with most of the property to the one with less of the\nproperty, so the x3 of the following sentence could have been shortened to\n**lo ka clani**.\n\n    **lidne** = _x 1 is before x2 in sequence x3_\n    **clani** = _x 1 is long in dimension x2 by standard x3_\n    **zmadu** = _x 1 exceeds x2 in property/aspect x3 by amount x4_\n    **mleca** = _x 1 is less than/is less characterized than x2 by property/aspect x3 by amount x4_\n    **mei** = _Convert number n to selbri: x 1 is the mass formed from the set x2, which has the n members of x3_\n\nNotice here that x3 are supposed to be individuals, x2 a set and x1 a mass.\n\nWhat would **mi ci mei** mean?\n\nAnwer: _We are group of three._\n\n    **si'e** = _Convert number n to selbri: x 1 is n times x2_\n\nExample: **le vi plise cu me'i pi pa si'e lei mi cidja be ze'a lo djedi** –\n_This apple here is less than one tenth of my food for one day_\n\nPlease note that the definition of **si'e** when looked up will tell you that\nit's \"x1 is an nth of x2\", instead of \"x1 is n times x2\". But people only use\nit as I have defined it, so the definition in the dictionaries will probably\nchange.\n\n    **cu'o** = _Convert number n to selbri: x 1 has n probability of occurring under conditions x2_\n\nExample:\n\n**lo nu mi mrobi'o cu pa cu'o lo nu mi denpa ri**  \n _An event of me dying has probability 1 under the conditions: I wait for it =\nMe dying is completely certain if I wait long enough._  \n---  \n  \n    **denpa** = _x 1 waits for x2, being in state x3 until resuming/doing x4_\n    **va'e** = _Convert number n to selbri: x 1 is at the n'th position on the scale x2_\n\nExample:\n\n**li pa no cu ro va'e la torinon**  \n _10 is the highest value on the Torino-scale._  \n---  \n  \n## Lesson 20: **bo** , **ke** , **co** , and more cuteness\n\nSay you're an important American buyer of computers. How do you express this?\nFor constructs like these, tanru are ideal: **mi vajni merko skami te vecnu**.\nNo wait, that's not right. Tanru are grouped from left to right, so this tanru\nis understood: ((**vajni merko**) **skami**) **te vecnu** , a buyer of\ncomputers for important Americans. You can't change the order of the selbri to\nget a useful tanru. Neither can this be solved with logical connectives, which\nyou will first learn about later anyway. The only way to make a fitting tanru\nis to force the selbri to group differently.\n\nTo bind two selbri close together in a tanru, the word **bo** can be placed\nbetween them: **mi vajni bo merko skami bo te vecnu** is read **mi** (**vajni\nbo merko**) (**skami bo te vecnu**), which is useful in this context. If bo is\nplaced between several selbri in a row, they are grouped from right to left\ninstead of the usual left to right: **mi vajni merko bo skami bo te vecnu** is\nread **vajni** (**merko bo** (**skami bo te vecnu**)) an _important (American\ncomputer-buyer)_ , which is even more appropriate in the situation.\n\n    **bo** = _Binds two selbri together strongly._\n\nHow would you say _That's a tasty yellow apple_?\n\n    **kukte** = _x 1 is tasty for x2_\n\nAnswer: **ti kukte pelxu bo plise**\n\nWhat about _That's a big, tasty yellow apple_?\n\nAnswer: **ti barda kukte bo pelxu bo plise**\n\nAnother approach to this is to use the words **ke…ke'e**. These can be\nconsidered as equivalent to the parenthesises used in the paragraph above.\n**ke** begins strong selbri grouping, **ke'e** ends it.\n\n    **ke** = _begin strong selbri grouping._\n    **ke'e** = _end strong selbri grouping._\n\nThe strength of the binding is the same as that of **bo**. Therefore, **mi\nvajni merko bo skami bo te vecnu** can be written **mi vajni ke merko ke skami\nte vecnu {ke'e} {ke'e}**.\n\nHow could you say _I'm a German seller of yellow homes?_\n\nAnswer: **mi dotco ke pelxu zdani vecnu**\n\nWhile we're at messing with the ordinary tanru structure, there is another\nword worth paying attention to. If I want to say that I'm a professional\ntranslator, I could say **mi fanva se jibri**.\n\n    **jibri** = _x 1 is a job of x2_\n    **dotybau** = _x 1 is German used by x2 to say x3_\n    **glibau** = _x 1 is English used by x2 to say x3_\n\nIf I wanted to say that I'm a professional translater from English to German,\nI'd have to mess around with **be** and **bei** : **mi fanva be le dotybau bei\nle glibau be'o se jibri** , and the fact that it was a tanru could quickly be\nlost in speech due to the complicated structure of the sentence. Here, we can\nuse the word **co**. it inverts the tanru, making the rightmost selbri modify\nthe leftmost instead of the other way around:\n\n**mi se jibri co fanva le dotybau le glibau** is the same bridi as the\nprevious Lojban one, but much more easy to understand. Notice that any sumti\nbefore the tanru fills **se jibri** , while any following it only fills the\nmodifying selbri: **fanva**.\n\n    **co** = _Invert tanru. Any previous sumti fill the modified, any following fill the modifier._\n\nThe strength by which two selbri are bound together with co is very weak –\neven weaker than normal tanru grouping without any grouping words. This makes\nsure that, in a co-construct, the leftmost selbri is always the selbri being\nmodified, and the rightmost always modifies, even if any of those parts are\ntanru. This makes a co-construct easy to parse:\n\n**ti pelxu plise co kukte** is read **ti** (**pelxu plise**) **co kukte** ,\nwhich is the same as **ti kukte pelxu bo plise**. This also means that a\n**ke…ke'e** cannot encompass a **co**.\n\nThe cmavo of the selma'o GIhA, the bridi-tail afterthought logical\nconnectives, however, binds even looser than **co**. This is in order to\ntotally avoid confusion about which selbri binds to which in a GIhA-construct.\nThe answer is simple: The GIhA never emcompasses any selbri-groups.\n\nHow can you express _I am an important American buyer of computers_ using a\n**co**?\n\nAnswer: **mi skami te vecnu co vajni merko**\n\nIf it's of any use, this is the list of different kind of selbri groupers\nranked by strength:\n\n  1. **bo** and **ke..ke'e**\n  2. logical connectives other than bridi-tail afterthought logical connectives (explained in lesson twenty-five)\n  3. no grouping words\n  4. **co**\n  5. bridi-tail afterthought logical connectives (also in lesson twenty-five)\n\nThe rest of this lesson will not be on selbri grouping, but much like lesson\nseventeen mention assorted words, which can be of use.\n\n**bo** has another use, which seems separate from selbri grouping: It can also\nbind a sumtcita to an entire bridi, so that the content of the sumtcita is not\na sumti, but the following bridi. This is best explained with an example.\n\n    **xebni** = _x 1 hates x2_\n\n**mi darxi do .i mu'i bo mi do xebni** – _I hit you, with motivation that I\nhate you._ Here the **bo** binds **mu'i** to the following bridi.\n\nThis is where the technical difference between tense sumtcita and other\nsumtcita is relevant. You see, when binding a normal sumtcita to a bridi with\n**bo** , it means that the following bridi somehow fits into the sumti place\nof the sumtcita. For the reason of God Knows Why, binding one of the words\n**ba** or **pu** to a bridi has the exact opposite effect. For example, in the\nbridi **mi darxi do .i ba bo do cinjikca** , one would assume that the second\nbridi is somehow filled into the sumti place of **ba** , meaning that the\nbridi first uttered took place in the future of the second bridi. That's not\nthe case, however, and the correct translation of that utterance would be \"I\nhit you. Afterwards, you flirt\". This weird rule is actually one of the main\nobstacles to a unification of all sumtcita into one single word class. Another\ndifference is that tense-sumtcita can be elided, even though they apply. This\nrule makes more sense, since we often can assume bridi is placed in a time and\nspace, but we can't assume that the sumtcita of BAI applies.\n\nThe unofficial word **me'oi** is equivalent to me la'e **zo'oi** , which means\nthat it converts the content of the next word into a selbri. It is used to\ninvent brivla on the fly: **mi ca zgana la me'oi X-files** for _I now watch\nX-files_. Like **zo'oi** and **la'oi** , it doesn't allow space, periods (or\npauses in speech) inside.\n\nThe word **gi** is strage kind of bridi separator, analogous to **.i** , but\nto my knowledge, it is used in only two different kinds of constructs: Most\noften with logical connectives, explained in lesson twenty-five, but also with\nsumtcita. With sumtcita it creates a useful, but hardly seen, construct:\n\n**mu'i gi BRIDI-1 gi BRIDI-2** , which is equivalent to **BRIDI-2 .i mu'i bo\nBRIDI-1**. Therefore, the example above, which explained why I hit you, can be\nwritten **mu'i gi mi xebni do gi mi darxi do** , or to preserve the same order\nas the original sentence, we can convert **mu'i** with **se** : **se mu'i gi\nmi darxi do gi mi xebni do**.\n\nIt is in examples like this that **gi** really can show its versatility. It\ndoes not just separate two bridi like **.i** does, but can also separate two\nconstructs within a bridi, making all constructs outside the scope of **gi**\napply to both bridi, as this example demonstrates:\n\n    **cinba** = _x 1 kisses x2 at locus x3_\n\n**mi ge prami do gi cinba do** leaves **mi** outside the construct, making it\napply to both bridi. This can also be done with **do** , which is also present\nin broth bridi: **mi ge prami gi cinba vau do**. Note that **vau** is needed\nto make do appear outside the second bridi.\n\nThus, we can write the original sentence shorter: **mi mu'i gi xebni gi darxi\nvau do** , or, to omit even the **vau** , we can write it even shorter and\nmore elegantly: **mi do mu'i gi xebni gi darxi**\n\n## Lesson 21: **COI**\n\nIn this lesson, you will familiarize yourself with vocatives, or **ma'oi\ncoi**. They get their own lesson, not because understanding these provides a\nbasis for understanding Lojban grammar in general, or because they are hard to\nunderstand, but rather because they are very often used in casual speech, and\nthere are a lot of them.\n\nA vocative is used partly to define who **do** refers to. If the vocative is\nfollowed by a cmevla, the cmevla gets an implied la in front of it. If a\nselbri follows, a **le** is used as a gadri instead.\n\nIn these examples, I will use the vocative **coi** , with means _Hi_ or\n_Hello_.\n\nIf a person is called **la + SELBRI** , using a vocative with only the selbri\nto address that person will mean you refer to her as actually being the x1 of\nthat selbri, which is often wrong. If, for instance, a person is called **la\ntsani** , _Sky_ , saying **coi tsani** refers to her as a **le tsani** ,\nmeaning _Hi, you sky_ , while **coi la tsani** correctly refers to her as\nsomeone called \"Sky\", meaning _Hi Sky_. This is a frequent mistake, especially\namong new Lojbanists.\n\nAll vocatives have a famyma'o which is sometimes required. This is **do'u**.\nIt's mostly used if both the first word after the vocative phrase and the last\nword of the phrase is a selbri, so that it prevents forming a tanru:\n\n    **do'u** = _End vocative phrase. Usually elidable._\n    **klaku** = _x 1 cries x2 (tears) for reason x3_\n**coi la gleki do'u klaku fi ma**  \n _Hello Happy. Why are you crying?_  \n---  \n  \nThe generic vocative, **doi** , does nothing except defining who is being\nreferred to by **do** :\n\n**xu doi .ernsyt. do dotco merko**  \n _Ernst, are you a German-American?_  \n---  \n  \nAll the other vocatives have some content beside defining **do**. **coi** ,\nwhich you know, also means _Hello_ , for example. Many of the vocatives have\ntwo or three definitions like the attitudinals. Like attitudinals, this is\nbecause they can be modified with **cu'i** and **nai** , though only one\nvocative has the **cu'i** -form defined.\n\nSome important vocatives are listed in the table below. There are others, but\nthose are not used much.\n\nvocative  | Without suffix  | cu'i  | nai   \n---|---|---|---  \ncoi  | Hello  |  |   \nco'o  | Goodbye  |  |   \nje'e  | Understood / OK  |  | Not understood   \nfi'i  | Welcome  |  | Not welcome here   \npe'u  | Please  |  |   \nki'e  | Thanks  |  | Disappreciation   \nre'i  | Ready to recieve  |  | Not ready   \nju'i  | Hey!  | At ease  | Ignore me   \nta'a  | Interruption  |  |   \nvi'o  | Will do  |  | Will not do   \nke'o  | Please repeat  |  | No repeat needed   \ndi'ai  | well-wish  |  | curse   \n  \nNotice that **di'ai** is experimental\n\nWhat would **coi co'o** mean?\n\nAnswer: _Greetings in passing_ or _Hello and Goodbye_\n\n**je'e** is used as _OK_ , but also the appropriate response when receiving\npraise or thanks (at least, if you want to be modest), as it indicates that\nthe praise or thanks was successfully understood.\n\nTranslate **ki'e sidju be mi bei lo vajni .i je'e .jenifyn.**\n\n    **sidju** = _x 1 helps x2 do x3_\n\nAnswer: _Thanks, you helper of me to do something important._ _No problem,\nJennifer_\n\nAnd **fi'i te vecnu .i e'o do citka**\n\nAnswer: _Welcome, buyer. Please eat!_\n\n**re'i** is used to signal that you are ready to be spoken to. It can be used\nas the Lojban equivalent of _What can I do for you?_ or perhaps replace\n_Hello_ , when speaking on a phone. **re'i nai** can mean _AFK_ or _Be there\nis a second._\n\nTranslate: _Hello, what can I do for you, Interpreter/Translater?_\n\nAnswer: **coi re'i la fanva**\n\n**ta'a** is used when attempting to politely interrupt someone else. What\nwould be good responses to this?\n\nTranslate: **ta'a ro do mi co'a cliva**\n\n    **cliva** = _x 1 leaves x2 via route x3_\n\nAnswer: _Excuse me for interrupting, everyone. I begin to leave now_ Notice\nthat no famyma'o or **.i** is needed.\n\n**ke'o** is used a lot when inexperienced Lojbanists speak together vocally.\nIt's quite a handy word\n\n    **sutra** = _x 1 is quick at doing x2_\n\nTranslate: **.y ke'o sutra tavla**\n\nAnswer: _Uh, Please repeat, you quick speaker._\n\nAnd _Okay okay, I got it already! I'll do it!_\n\nAn answer: **ke'o nai .ui nai vi'o**\n\n## Lesson 22: Quantifying sumti\n\nMost other learning materials such as The Complete Lojban Language and Lojban\nfor Beginners were written before the official adoptation \"xorlo\", a change in\nthe rules about gadri definition and gadri quantification. The obsoleteness of\nsome of the text in the older learning materials was a major cause for the\nmotivation to write these lessons. Unfortunately for me, quantification of\nsumti can become a very complex topic when the implications of certain rules\nare discussed in detail. In order to fulfill the goal of this text being\naccurate enough to represent the official \"gold standard\" BPFK rules, this\nchapter was among the last ones finished and the ones most frequenty\nrewritten. I strongly encourage anyone who finds mistakes in this text to\ncontact me in order for them to be corrected.\n\nHaving said that disclaimer, let's get started:\n\nThe first concept you should know about is \"distributivity\". In lesson\nfourteen I used the word \"individuals\" about a group of objects considered\ndistributively. A group of objects considered distributively means that the\nselbri in question apply to each of the objects. This stands in contrast to\nnon-distributivity (which masses have), in which the group has other\nproperties than each of the individuals do. The distinction between\ndistributivity (individual-like) and non-distributivity (mass-like) is of\nrelevance when quantifying sumti.\n\nSometimes it's also mentioned how one sumti can distribute over another sumti,\nso I'll include this as well. What it means is that if sumti A stands in\nrelation X to sumti B, with sumti A distributing over sumti B, then each A\nstands in relation X to B. Let's have an example in English:\n\n_Three dogs bite two men._  \n---  \n  \nIf the dogs distribute over the men, then each of three dogs has bitten two\nmen, meaning that between 2 and 6 different men was bitten (since one really\nunlucky man could have been bitten by all three dogs), whereas if the men\ndistribute over then dogs, then two men were each bitten by tree dogs, fixing\nthe number of men to 2, but allowing between 3 and 6 dogs.\n\nWhen there can be any doubt as to which sumti distributes over which, the rule\nis _that the first mentioned sumti always distributes over the last\nmentioned_. This is irrespective of place structure, so if x1 and x2 are\nswitched with **se** , x2, which is mentioned first, will distribute over x1.\n\nNow, back to quantification. Let us first consider how one can quantify\ndescription sumti, which are sumti of the form GADRI BRIVLA. The number string\nwhich does the quantification can be placed before the gadri, in which case it\nis referred to as an _outer quantifier_ , and it can be placed between the\ngadri and the brivla, in which case it's an _inner quantifier_. Any kind of\nnumber string can act as a quantifier.\n\nThe rules for how inner and outer quantifiers affects sumti depend on the kind\nof gadri which is used:\n\n  * **lo** and **le**. An inner quantifier tells us how many objects are being spoken of - how many objects are in the discourse total. If an outer quantifier is present, the sumti is distributed over that amount of objects. As stated earlier, if no outer quantifier is present, it's vague how many objects the selbri applies to (though not none), and whether it does so distributively or non-distributively. Examples are always a good idea, so here they are:\n\n**mu lo mu bakni cu se jirna** \\- The inner quantifier of five tells us that\nwe speak about five pieces of cattle, and the outer quantifier of five tells\nus that the selbri is true for each of the five. Therefore, it means \"All the\nfive cows had horns\".\n\n    **bakni** = _x 1 is a cow/ox/cattle/calf etc of breed x2_\n\n    **jirna** = _x 1 is the horn of x2 (metaphor: any pointed extremity)_\n\nWhat does the following bridi mean?\n\n**lo ru'urgubupu be li re pi ze mu cu jdima lo pa re sovda**\n\n    **ru'urgubupu** = _x 1 is measures to be x2 British pounds (GBP)_\n    **jdima** = _x 1 is the price of x2 to buyer x3 set by vendor x4_\n    **sovda** = _x 1 is a gamete (egg/sperm) of x2_\n\nAnswer:  \"Twelve eggs cost 2.75 British pounds\" which, as the English\ntranslation, could mean both that they cost 2.75 each (distributively) or that\nall twelve together cost 2.75 (non-distributively)\n\n**so le ta pa pa ci'erkei cu clamau mi** (notice that the **ta** goes before\nthe inner quantifier)\n\n    **ci'erkei** = _x 1 plays game x2 governed by rules x3 interrelating game parts x4 {this is used to translate \"play\" in the sense \"play a game\" rather than, for instance \"playing pretend\" or \"playing House\"_}\n\n    **clamau** = _x 1 is taller/longer than x2 in direction x3 my marigin x4_\n\nAnswer: The inner states there are 11 players in the discourse, and the outer\nstates that the selbri applies to nine of them distributively. Thus it means\n\"Nine of the eleven players are taller than me\"\n\nThere are a few points that needs to be raised regarding quantification of\n**lo** /**le** :\n\nUsing **lo** with an outer quantifier, \"{number} **lo** {selbri}\", works like\n\"{number} {selbri}\" in that it quantifies over individuals. Therefore, both\n**ci gerku cu batci re nanmu** and **ci lo gerku cu batci re lo nanmu**\nconsider both the group of dogs and the group of men distributively.\nTherefore, each of the three dogs bit each of the two men, with six biting\nevents in total.\n\n(_{number}**lo** {selbri}_ is defined as _{number} da poi me lo {selbri}_ ,\nwhile _{number} {selbri}_ is _{number} da poi {selbri}_. **da** and **me**\nwill be explained later. Put simply, the **lo** version takes context into\naccount more than the bare number version, which quantifies over anything and\neverything that fits in the selbri's x1.)\n\n    **batci** = _x 1 bites/pinches x2 at locus x3 using x4 as pinching tool._\n\nSecondly: What if there is no outer quantifier? Does this mean that it _is_\nthere, but it's elided? Nope. If there is any kind of outer quantifier, elided\nor not, it would force the sumti to be distributive, which would mean that\nneither **lo** nor **le** could be used with predicates that apply\ncollectively. Therefore, if no outer quantifier is present, it's not only\nelided - it's simply not there. Sumti without an outer quantifier can be\nreferred to as \"constants\".\n\nThirdly, it makes no sense to have an outer quantifier which is larger than\nthe inner one. It means that the selbri holds true for more sumti than are\npresent in the discourse - but since they appear in a bridi, they _are_ part\nof the discourse. It's grammatical to do it, though.\n\nLastly, placing a **lo** or a **le** in front of a sumti is grammatical, if\nthere is an inner quantifier present. \"**lo** /**le** {number} {sumti}\" is\ndefined as \"**lo** /**le** {number} **me** {sumti}\".\n\nSo what would this mean? **mi nelci lo mi briju kansa .i ku'i ci lo re mu ji'i\nri cu lazni**\n\n    **briju** = _x 1 is an office for worker x2 at location x3_\n    **kansa** = _x 1 accompanies x2 in action/state/enterprise x3_\n    **lazni** = _x 1 is lazy, avoiding work concerning x2_\n\nAnswer: \"I like my co-workers, but three out of about twenty five of them are\nlazy\"\n\n  * **la**. An inner quantifier is grammatical if the name is a selbri - in this case, it's considered part of the name. An outer quantifier is used to quantify distributively over such individuals (much like **lo** /**le**) It's grammatical when placed in front of {number} {sumti}, in which case, the both the number and the sumti is considered the name.\n\nTranslate this: **re la ci bargu cu jibni le mi zdani**\n\nAnswer:  Two \"The Three Arches\" are located close to my house\" (Perhaps The\nThree Arches are a kind of restaurant?)\n\n  * **loi** and **lei**. An inner quantifier tells us how many members there are in the mass/masses in question. An outer quantifier quantifies distributively {!} over these masses\n\nNotice here that while masses consist of a number of objects considered non-\ndistributively, an outer quantifier always treats each of these masses as an\nindividual.\n\nWhen placed before a number string, then a sumti, **loi** /**lei** is defined\nas \"**lo gunma be lo** /**le** {number} {sumti}\" - \"The mass consisting of the\n{number} of {sumti}\".\n\nAttempt to translate this: **dei joi di'e gunma re loi bi valsi .i ca'e dei\njai se jalge lo nu jetnu**\n\n    **gunma** = _x 1 is a mass of the individuals x2_\n\n    **valsi** = _x 1 is a word, meaning x2 in language x3_\n\n    **ca'e** = _Attitudinal: Evidential: I define_\n\n    **jetnu** = _x 1 is true according to metaphysics/epistemology x2_\n\nAnswer:  \"This very utterance, mixed together with the next one, forms a mass,\nconsisting of two individual masses each of eight words. I define: This very\nutterance causes {it} to be true.\"\n\n  * **lai**. Much like **la** , an inner quantifier (when name is a selbri) is part of the name. An outer one quantifies distributively. Before a number+sumti, both the sumti and the number make up the name.\n\nWhen a fraction is used as an outer quantifier to quantify **loi** , **lei**\nor **lai** , one speaks about only part of one mass (for instance, \"half of\nthe Johnsons\" - **pi mu lai .djansyn.**).\n\n  * **lo'i** and **le'i**. An inner quantifier describes the amount of members of the set. An outer quantifies distributively over several of such sets. When placed before a number and a sumti, it's defined as \"**lo selcmi be** lo**/** le _{number} {sumti}\" - \"The set of {number} {sumti}\"._\n\nTranslate **lo'i ro se cinki cu bramau la'a pa no no lo'i ro se bogykamju\njutsi**\n\n    **cinki** = _x 1 is an insect of species x2_\n\n    **la'a** = _Attitudinal: Discursive: Probably_\n\n    **bramau** = _x 1 is bigger than x2 in dimension x3 by marigin x4_\n\n    **bogykamju** = _x 1 is the spine of x2_\n\n    **jutsi** = _x 1 is the species of genus x2, family x3 ... (open ended classification)_\n\nAnswer:  \"The set of all the species of insects is probably bigger than one\nhundred sets of all species of vertebrates\"\n\n  * **la'i**. As with **lai**\n\nLike with the mass gadri, an outer quantifier before a set gadri enables one\nto speak about a fraction of a set. In front of a number and a sumti, it's\ndefined as \"**lo selcmi be la** {number} {sumti}\" - \"The set consisting of The\n{Number} {Sumti}\" (considered a name)\n\n  * **lo'e** and **le'e**. Are for some reason not included in the currently accepted gadri proposal. If one were to extend the rules of another gadri, **lo** /**le** would probably be the best choice (since both operates with individuals rather than groups), and so one would expect the outer quantifier to force distributivity over the amount of typical/stereotypical things given by the inner quantifier.\n\nWhen quantifying sumka'i representing several objects, it is useful to\nremember that they usually behave like **lo** -sumti. By definition, \"{number}\n{sumti}\" is defined as \"{number} **da poi ke'a me** {sumti}\". You will not be\nfamiliar with **da** until a few lessons later, so take it on faith that it\nmeans \"something\" in this context. Therefore, **ci mi** means \"Two of those\nwho belong to \"us\"\".\n\nSome important uses of quantification requires you to be quantify selbri or\nobjects whose identity is unknown. This is done by \"logically quantified\nvariables\". These, as well as how to quantify them will be covered in lessons\ntwenty-seven.\n\nLastly, how can you quantify uncountable substances like sugar or water? One\nsolution is to quantify it using inexact numbers. This use is vague, not only\nbecause the value of the number is vague, but also because it's not specified\non what scale you're counting: The sugar could be considered a group of many\ncrystals, counted one at a time, and the water could be quantified by the\namounts of raindrops it took to make the body of water in question. While this\nway of counting is legitimate, it's not very exact and can easily confuse or\nmislead.\n\nA way to be explicit about non-countability is to use the null operand\n**tu'o** as an inner quantifier.\n\n    **tu'o** = _Null operand ( Ø ). Used in unary mekso._\n\nThis solution is elegant and intuitive, and also gives me an excuse to quote\nthis horrifying, yet comical example from the original **xorlo** -proposal:\n\n**le nanmu cu se snuti .i ja'e bo lo tu'o gerku cu kuspe le klaji**\n\n    **snuti** = _x 1 is an accident on the part of x2_\n\n    **ja'e** = _sumtcita: BAI: (from**jalge**): Bridi results in {sumti}_\n\n    **kuspe** = _x 1 spans/extends over x2_\n\n    **klaji** = _x 1 is a road/avenue/street at x2 accessing x3_\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nAnswer:  \"The man had an accident and so there was dog all over the road\"\n\nA second method of quantifying substances is to use the tenses **ve'i** ,\n**ve'a** and **ve'u** as mentioned in lesson ten:\n\n**ti ve'i djacu** \\- This is a small amount of water\n\n    **djacu** = _x 1 is an expanse of water/is made of water/contains water_\n\nThirdly, of course, you could use a brivla to give an exact measurement:\n\n**le ta djacu cu ki'ogra be li re pi ki'o ki'o** \\- \"That water has a mass of\n2.000 000 kilograms\"\n\n    **ki'ogra** = _x 1 measures in mass x2 kilograms by standard x3_\n\n## Lesson 23: Negation\n\nSometimes, just saying what's the truth is not enough. Often, we want to\nspecify what's not the truth, and we do this by using negation.\n\nNegation in English mostly involves _not_ , and is completely arbitrary and\nambiguous. We, as Lojbanists, can't have that, of course, so Lojban contains\nan elegant and unambigious system for negating. What will be presented here\nare the official gold-standard rules. Disapproval of these \"golden rules\"\nconcerning **na** is growing, and there is disagreement about what rule set\nshould replace it. For now, I will stick with the official rules, and\ntherefore, so will you, dear reader.\n\nThe first you need to know about is bridi negation, so called because it\nnegates the bridi it's in, saying it's not true. The way to negate a bridi is\nto place **na** first in the sentence with a **ku** after it, or just before\nthe selbri.\n\n    **speni** = _x 1 is married to x2 under convention x3_\n\nThus: **na ku le mi speni cu ninmu** states that _My spouse is not a woman_.\nIt states nothing about what my wife is, or if I even have a wife. It only\nstates that I do not have a wife who is also a woman. This has an important\nimplication: If the negation of a bridi is false, the bridi must be true: **na\nku le mi speni cu na ninmu** must mean that I have both a spouse, and that she\nis a she.\n\nIt is possible to use bridi negations in all bridi, even the implicit bridi of\ndescriptive sumti. **lo na prenu** can refer to anything non-human, whether it\nbe a sphinx, a baseball or the property of appropriateness.\n\n    **bau** = _sumtcita, from bangu: using the language of {sumti_}\n\n    **se ja'e** = _sumtcita, from se jalge: because of {sumti_}\n\nOften when using **na** , it's a problem that it negates the entire bridi. If\nI say **mi na sutra tavla bau le glibau se ja'e le nu mi dotco** , I end up\nnegating too much, and it is not clear that I wanted to only negate that I\nspeak fast. The sentence could suggest that I in fact speak fast because of\nsome other reason, for instance that I speak fast in French because I'm\nGerman. To express the sentence more precisely, I need to only negate that I\nspeak fast, and not the other things.\n\nTo only negate part of a bridi, **na ku** can be moved around the bridi and\nplaced anywhere a sumti can go. It then negates any sumti, selbri and sumtcita\nplaced after it. When placed immediately before the selbri, the **ku** can be\nelided.\n\nMoving **na ku** from the left end of the bridi and rightwards effects any\nquantifiers in a certain way, as can be seen by this example:\n\nThere are forces within the Lojban community who, perhaps rightly, think that\nthere is no good reason that a **na** placed before a selbri negates the\nentire bridi, whereas a **na ku** any other place negates only what is\ntrailing behind it. However, in these lessons you will be taught what is still\nthe official stance, namely that **na** before the selbri negates the bridi.\n\nThe use of **na ku** is exemplified with the following examples.\n\n**na ku ro remna cu verba** _It's not true that: All humans are children_\n\n**su'o remna na ku cu verba** _For at least one human it's not true that: It's\na child_. See that the **na ku** is placed before **cu** , since a sumti can\ngo only before, not after the **cu**. Had I only used **na** , it would have\nto go after **cu** \\- but that would have negated the entire bridi, meaning\n\"It's not true that: At least one human is a child\".\n\nWhen the **na ku** is moved rightwards, any quantifier is inverted - that is:\n**ro** is turned into **su'o**. This is, of course, only if the meaning of the\nbridi has to be preserved. This means that when the **na ku** is placed at the\nend of the bridi, only the selbri is negated but all the sumti and sumtcita\nare preserved, as can be seen by these three identical bridi:\n\n    **ckule** = _x 1 is a school at location x2 teaching x3 to students x4 and operated by x5_\n\n**na ku ro verba cu ve ckule fo su'o ckule** – _It's not true that all\nchildren are students in a school._\n\n**su'o verba cu ve ckule na ku fo su'o ckule** – _Some children are students\nin not a single school._\n\n**su'o verba cu ve ckule fo ro ckule na ku** – _Some children are for all\nschools not students in them._\n\nThe opposite of **na** is **ja'a**. This is barely ever used, since it is\ndefault in most bridi. One exception is repeated bridi (next lesson).\nSometimes it's used to put more weight on the truth of the bridi, as in **la\n.bab. ja'a melbi** = \"Bob is indeed beautiful\".\n\nWhile the mechanism of **na ku** resembles natural language negation, it can\nbe difficult to keep track of exactly what is negated and how that affects the\nbridi. For that reason, the construct **na ku** is rarely seen anywhere other\nthan the beginning of a bridi. In most cases where more specific negation is\nneeded people resort to a different method. This method, called scalar\nnegation, is an elegant and intuitive tool. Using it, you effect only the\nselbri, since the words used in scalar negation binds to the selbri much like\nthe word **se**.\n\nThe name _scalar negation_ is derived from the fact that the words which bind\nto the selbri can be placed along a scale from affirmation over negation and\nto stating that the opposite case is true:\n\nThese words are not negators in the same sense as **na**. They do not state\nthat a bridi is false, but makes a positive statement that a bridi is true –\nthe same bridi, but with a different selbri. This distinction is mostly\nacademic, though. If, for example, I state that **mi na'e se nelci** \"I am\nnon-liked\", I actually state that some selbri applies to me, which is also on\na relevant scale with the selbri **nelci**. Most of the time, we assume a\nscale where the positions are mutually exclusive (like love-like-dislike-\nhate), so **mi na'e se nelci** implies **mi na se nelci** Therefore, the words\n**no'e** and **to'e** should only be used when the selbri is placed on some\nobvious scale: **le mi speni cu to'e melbi** – _My spouse is ugly_ makes\nsense, since we immediately know what the opposite of beautiful is, while **mi\nklama le mi to'e zdani** – _I go to my opposite thing of home_ , while\ngrammatical, leaves the listener guessing what the speaker's _opposite-home_\nis and should be avoided. So how can you negate only the selbri without also\nimplying that the selbri is correct at some other position on a truth-scale?\nSimple: Moving the **na ku** to the rightmost end of the bridi, as\ndemonstrated a few lines above. This feature is very useful. Some Lojbanists\nprefer to prefix the rafsi **nar** (the rafsi of **na**) in front of the\nselbri - this has the same effect, but I advise against it, because it makes\nfamiliar brivla seem alien, and it's harder to understand when spoken\ncasually. If a situation arises where you need to negate only the selbri, but\nwant it to be clear before the end of the bridi, the experimental cmavo\n**na'ei** , which grammatically works like **na'e** , can be used _**na'ei**_\n: Negates the following selbri only Try to translate these sentences: _My\nspouse is not a woman_ (meaning that he is a male) Answer: **le mi speni cu\nna'e / to'e ninmu**. Using scalar negation here implies that he exists, which\nna did not._My spouse is not really a woman_ Answer: **le mi speni cu no'e\nninmu**. The scale here is presumed to be from woman to man._I don't speak\nfast in English because I'm German_ Answer: **mi na'e sutra tavla bau le\nglibau se ja'e le nu mi dotco** Also, note that whenever these words are used\ntogether with a tanru, they only affect the leftmost selbri. In order to make\nit bind to the whole tanru or parts of the tanru, the usual tanru-grouping\nwords can be used. Try to say _I sell something which is not yellow homes_\nusing the tanru **pelxu zdani vecnu** Answer: **mi na'e ke pelxu zdani ke'e\nvecnu or mi na'e pelxu bo zdani vecnu** When attempting to answer: _Is the\nking of the USA fat?_ , all of these negations fail. While it's technically\ncorrect to negate it with **na** , since it makes no assumptions of that is\ntrue, it's mildly misleading since it could lead the listener to believe there\nis a king of the USA. For these scenarios, there is a metalinguistic negator,\n**na'i**.\n\n    **na'i** = _metalinguistic negator. Something is wrong with assigning a truth value to the bridi._\nBecause **na'i** can be needed anywhere it has been given the grammar of the\nattitudinals, which means it can appear anywhere, and it attaches to the\nprevious word or construct.\n\n    **palci** = _x 1 is evil by standard x2_\n**le na'i pu te zukte be le skami cu palci**  \n _The sought goal {mistake!} of the computer was evil _, probably protests\nthat computers can seek a goal volitionally.__  \n---  \n  \nSince this is a lesson on negation, I believe the word **nai** deserves a\nshort mention. It is used to negate minor grammatical constructs, and can be\nused in combination with attitudinals, all sumtcita including tenses,\nvocatives and logical connectives. The rules for negating using **nai** depend\non the construct, and so the effect of **nai** has been discussed when\nmentioning the construct themselves. The exception is sumtcita, where the\nrules for negation are more complex, and will not be discussed here.\n\n_Note:_ At the time of writing, it has been proposed to move **nai** to the\nselma'o CAI, which means the semantics of **nai** depend on which selma'o it\nfollows.\n\n## Lesson 24: brika'i/pro-bridi and **ko'a**\n\nIf I say that I'm called Mikhail, **zo .mikail. cmene mi** , and you have to\nsay the exact same bridi, what would that be? One of the many answers is **do\nse cmene zo .mikail.**. For the bridi to be the same, you have to replace\n**mi** with **do** , and it doesn't matter which if you say the bridi with the\n**se** -converted selbri or not. This is because a bridi is not the words\nwhich express it – a bridi is an idea, an abstract proposition. The word\n**mi** when I say it and the word **do** when you do refers to the same sumti,\nso the two bridi are identical.\n\nThis lesson is on **brika'i** , the bridi equivalent of sumka'i. They are word\nwhich represent entire bridi. Here it is important to remember that a bridi\nconsists only of sumti and the things which contain the sumti, selbri and\nsumtcita. Neither attitudinals, nor the semantic layer of **ko** or **ma** are\npart of the bridi proper, and so these are not represented by a **brika'i**.\n\nThere are much fewer **brika'i** than there are sumka'i. We will begin by\ngoing through some of the words in the most used series, called GOhA:\n\n    **go'u** = _Repeats remote past bridi_\n    **go'a** = _Repeats past bridi_\n    **go'e** = _Repeats next-to-last bridi_\n    **go'i** = _Repeats last mentioned bridi_\n    **go'o** = _Repeats future bridi_\n    **nei** = _Repeats current bridi_\n    **no'a** = _Repeats outer bridi_\n\nSome of the GOhA-**brika'i**. Notice the familiar **i** , **a** , **u**\n-pattern for close in past, medium in past and distant in past.\n\nThese are very much like the sumka'i **ri** , **ra** and **ru**. They can only\nrefer to main bridi of jufra, and not those contained in relative phrases or\ndescription sumti. The main bridi can contain a relative phrase, of course,\nbut a **brika'i** can never be used to refer to only the relative phrase.\n\nA GOhA acts grammatically much like a selbri, any construct which can apply to\nselbri can also apply to these. The place structure of a GOhA is the same as\nthat of the bridi it represents, and the sumti are by default the same as in\nthe bridi it represents. Filling the sumti places of a GOhA explicitly\noverwrites the sumti of the bridi it represents. Contrast:\n\nA: **mi citka lo plise** B: **go'i** – _I eat an apple._ _You do._ with\n\nA: **mi citka lo plise** B: **mi go'i** – _I eat an apple._ _I do, too._\n\nThese **brika'i** are very useful when answering a question with **xu** :\n\nA: **xu do nelci le mi speni** B: **go'i / na go'i** – _Do you like my wife?_\n_Yes./No._. The **xu** , being an attitudinal, is not copied.\n\nWhen repeating bridi negated by **na** , that is: Bridi where **na** is placed\nin the prenex (lesson twenty-seven), in the beginning of the bridi or right\nbefore the selbri, the rules for copying over **na** are different from what\none might expect. Any **na** is copied over, but any additional **na** in the\nbrika'i replaces the first na. Let me show you with an example:\n\nA: **mi na citka lo plise**\n\nB: **mi go'i** = **mi na citka lo plise**\n\nC: **mi na go'i** = **mi na citka lo plise**\n\nD: **mi na na go'i** = **mi citka lo plise** = **mi ja'a go'i**\n\n**nei** and **no'a** are not used much, except for _mind-breaking purposes_ ,\nwhich is making up bridi which are hard to parse, like **dei na se du'u le\nno'a la'e le nei**. Since **nei** repeats the current outer bridi, however,\n**le nei** can be used to refer to the x1 of the current outer bridi, **le se\nnei** the x2 and so on.\n\nWhen using **brika'i** , one must always be wary of copying sentences with the\npersonal sumka'i like **mi** , **do** , **ma'a** ect, and be careful not to\nrepeat them when they are in the wrong contect, as shown in the two examples\nwith apple eating above. Instead of replacing them one by one, though, the\nword **ra'o** anywhere in the bridi updates the personal sumka'i so that they\napply for the speaker's perspective:\n\nA: **mi do prami** B: **mi do go'i** is equivalent to A: **mi do prami** B:\n**go'i ra'o**\n\n    **ra'o** = _Update all personal sumka'i so that they now fit the speaker's point of view._\n\nThe only other series of brika'i are very easy to remember:\n\n    **broda** = _Bridi variable 1_\n    **brode** = _Bridi variable 2_\n    **brodi** = _Bridi variable 3_\n    **brodo** = _Bridi variable 4_\n    **brodu** = _Bridi variable 5_\n    **cei** = _Define bridi variable (not a brika'i and not in BRODA)_\n\nThe first five are just five instances of the same word. They can be used as\nshortcuts to bridi. After saying a bridi, saying **cei broda** defines that\nbridi as **broda** , and **broda** can then be used as **brika'i** for that\nbridi in the following conversation.\n\nWhile we're at it, there is an analogous series of sumka'i, which probably\ndoes not belong in this lesson, but here they are anyway:\n\n**ko'a** | Sumti variable 1  | **fo'a** | Sumti variable 6   \n---|---|---|---  \n**ko'e** | Sumti variable 2  | **fo'e** | Sumti variable 7   \n**ko'i** | Sumti variable 3  | **fo'i** | Sumti variable 8   \n**ko'o** | Sumti variable 4  | **fo'o** | Sumti variable 9   \n**ko'u** | Sumti variable 5  | **fo'u** | Sumti variable 10   \n  \nas well as the **cei** -equivalent for this series:\n\n    **goi** = _Define sumti variable_\n\nThese are used like the **brika'i** -series. Just place, for instance, **goi\nko'u** after a sumti, and that sumti can be referred to by **ko'u**.\n\nStrangely, these series are rarely used for their intended purpose. They are,\nhowever, used as arbitrary selbri and sumti in example texts, where **broda**\nand **brode** mean \"any selbri A\" and \"any selbri B\" and similarly for\n**ko'a** and friends:\n\n_So, is it true that the truth conditions of**ko'a ko'e broda na ku** are\nalways the same as **na ku ko'a ko'e broda**?_ _Nope, it isn't._\n\n## Lesson 25: Logical connectives\n\nIf you ask a Lojbanist: _Do you want milk or sugar in your coffee?_ she'll\nanswer: _Correct._\n\nWitty as this joke might be, it illustrates a weird property of the English\nway of asking this question. It is phrased as a true/false question, but it\nreally isn't. In Lojban, we can't have this kind of inconsistency, and so we\nmust find another way of asking this kind of question. If you think about it,\nit's pretty hard to find a good and easy way, and it seems Lojban have picked\na good way instead of an easy way.\n\nTo explain it, let us take two separate bridi: Bridi 1: _I like milk in my\ncoffee_ and bridi 2: _I like sugar in my coffee_. Both of these bridi can have\nthe state true or false. This yields four combinations of which bridi is/are\ntrue:\n\nA ) 1 and 2 B ) 1 but not 2\n\nC ) 2 but not 1 D )neither 1 nor 2\n\nI, in actuality, like milk in my coffee, and I'm indifferent as to whether\nthere is sugar in it or not. Therefore, my preference can be written A ) true\nB ) true C ) false D ) false, since both A and B yields true for me, but\nneither C nor D does. A more compact way of writing my coffee preferences\nwould be TTFF for true, true, false, false. Similarly, a person liking his\ncoffee black and unsweetened would have a coffee preference of FFFT. This\ncombitation of \"true\" and \"false\" is called a _truth function_ , in this case\nfor the two statements _I like milk in my coffee_ and _I like sugar in my\ncoffee_. Note that the order of the statements matters.\n\nIn Lojban, we operate with 4 truth functions, which we consider fundamental:\n\nA: TTTF (and/or)\n\nO: TFFT (if and only iff)\n\nU: TTFF (whether or not)\n\nE: TFFF (and)\n\nIn this example, they would translate to something like: A:_Just not black\ncoffee_ , O: _Either both milk or sugar, or nothing for me, please_ , U:\n_Milk, and I don't care about if there's sugar or not_ and E: _Milk and sugar,\nplease._.\n\nIn Lojban, you place the word for the truth function between the two bridi,\nselbri or sumti in question. That word is called a logical connective. The\nwords for truth functions between sumti (and just for sumti!) are **.a**\n**.o** **.u** and **.e**. How nice. For instance: _I am friends with an\nAmerican and a German_ would be **lo merko .e lo dotco cu pendo mi**.\n\nHow would you say: _I speak to you and no one else?_\n\nAnswer: **mi tavla do .e no drata** Note that this actually states that it's\ntrue that \"I speak to you\".\n\nOne more: _I like cheese whether or not I like coffee_\n\n    **ckafi** = _x 1 is a quantity/contains coffee from source/of grain x2_\n\nAnswer: **mi nelci lo'e cirla .u lo'e ckafi**\n\nYou can perhaps deduce that there are sixteen possible truth functions, so we\nneed to learn twelve more in order to know them all. Eight more can be\nobtained by negating either the first sentence or the second. The first is\nnegated by prefixing the truth function word with **na** , the second is\nnegated by placing **nai** after the word. For example, since **.e**\nrepresents TFFF, **.e nai** must be _both 1 is true and 2 is false_ , which is\nFTFF. Similarly, **na .a** is _Just not: 1 is true and 2 is false_ , which is\nTTFT. Doing this type of conversion in the head real-time is very, very hard,\nso perhaps one should focus on learning how logical connectives work in\ngeneral, and then learn the logical connectives themselves by heart.\n\nFour functions cannot be made this way: TTTT, TFTF, FTFT and FFFF. The first\nand the last cannot be made using logical connectives at all, but they are\nkind of useless anyway. Using a hypothetical logical connective in the\nsentence _I like milk FFFF sugar in my coffee_ is equivalent to saying _I\ndon't like coffee_ , just more complicated. The last two, TFTF and FTFT, can\nbe made by prefixing **.u** with good ol' **se** , which just reverts the two\nstatements. **se .u** , for instance is _B whether or not A_ , which is TFTF.\nThe final list of all logical connectives can be seen below.\n\nTTTT: Cannot be made\n\nTTTF: **.a**\n\nTTFT: **.a nai**\n\nTTFF: **.u** OR **.u nai**\n\nTFTT: **na .a**\n\nTFTF: **se .u**\n\nTFFT: **.o** OR **na .o nai**\n\nTFFF: **.e**\n\nFTTT: **na .a nai**\n\nFTTF: **na .o** OR **.o nai**\n\nFTFT: **se .u nai**\n\nFTFF: **.e nai**\n\nFFTT: **na .u** OR **na .u nai**\n\nFFTF: **na .e**\n\nFFFT: **na .e nai**\n\nFFFF: Cannot be made\n\nLogically, saying a sentence with a logical connective, like for instance **mi\nnelci lo'e cirla .e nai lo'e ckafi** is equivalent to saying two bridi, which\nare connected with the same logical connective: **mi nelci lo'e cirla .i {E\nNAI} mi nelci lo'e ckafi**. This is how the function of logical connectives is\ndefined. We will get to how to apply logical connectives to bridi in a moment.\n\nBy putting a _j_ in front of the core word of a logical connective, it\nconnects two selbri. An example is **mi ninmu na jo nanmu** _I am a man or a\nwoman, but not both_\n\n    **ninmu** = _x 1 is a woman_\n\nThis is _tanru-internal_ , meaning that it loosely binds selbri together, even\nwhen they form a tanru: **lo dotco ja merko prenu** means _a German or\nAmerican man_ , and is parsed **lo** (**dotco ja merko**) **prenu**. This\nbinding is slightly stronger that normal tanru-grouping (still weaker than\nspecific grouping-words), and as such, **lo dotco ja merko ninmu ja nanmu** is\nparsed **lo** (**dotco ja merko**) (**ninmu ja nanmu**). The selbri logical\nconnectives can also be attached to **.i** in order to connect two sentences\ntogether: **la .kim. cmene mi .i ju mi nanmu** _I'm called Kim, whether or not\nI'm a man_. The combination **.i je** states that both sentences are true,\nmuch like we would assume had no logical connective been present.\n\nUnfairly hard question: Using logical connectives, how would you translate _If\nyou're called Bob, you're a man._?\n\nAnswer: **zo .bab. cmene do .i na ja do nanmu** or _Either you're not named\nBob and a man, or you're not named Bob and not a man, or you're named Bob and\na man. But you can't be named Bob and not be a man._ The only combination not\npermitted is: _You're called Bob, but not a man._ This must mean that, if it's\ntrue that you're called Bob, you must be a man.\n\nIf we try to translate the sad, sad event of _I cried and gave away my dog_ ,\nwe run into a problem.\n\nAttempting to say the sentence with a **je** between the selbri _gave_ and\n_cried_ , would mean the same word for word, but unfortunately mean that _I\ncried the dog and gave away the dog_ , cf. the definition of logical\nconnectives. One can cry tears or even blood, but crying dogs is just silly.\n\nHowever, we can get around by using bridi-tail logical connectives. What they\ndo is that any previous sumtcita and sumti attaches to both selbri bound by\nthe bridi-tail logical connective, but any following sumti or sumtcita only\napplies to the last mentioned: The bridi splits up from one head to two tails,\nto speak metaphorically.\n\nThe form of a bridi-tail logical connective is gi'V, with the V for the vowel\nof the truth function.\n\nHow could you correctly translate the English sentence to Lojban?\n\nAnswer: **mi pu klaku gi'e dunda le mi gerku**\n\nWhat does **ro remna cu palci gi'o zukte lo palci** mean?\n\n    **palci** = _x 1 is evil by standard x2_\n\nAnswer: _People are evil if and only if they do evil things._\n\nFurthermore, there is a forethought all-but tanru internal group of connecters\nmade by prefixing _g_ in front of the truth function vowel. _Forethought_ in\nthis context means that they need to go in front of the things they connect,\nand thus you need to think about the grammatical structure of the sentence\nbefore saying it. All-but tanru internal means that it serves both as a\nconnective between sumti, bridi, selbri and bridi-tails, but not between two\nselbri of one tanru. Let me show you how it works, rewriting the Lojban\nsentence above:\n\n**go lo remna cu palci gi lo remna cu zukte lo palci**\n\nThe first logical connective in these kinds of constructs are what carries the\nvowel which signal what truth function is being used. The second logical\nconnective is always **gi** , and like **.i** , it has no truth function. It\nsimply serves to separate the two terms being connected. If you want to negate\nthe first or second sentence, a **nai** is suffixed to either the first (for\nthe first sentence) or second (for the second sentence) logical connective.\n\nProvided that the constructs are terminated properly, it has remarkable\nflexibility, as the following few examples demonstrate:\n\n**mi go klama gi cadzu vau le mi zdani** _I go, if and only if walk, to my\nhome_ or _I can only go to my home by walking._ Notice that the **vau** is\nneeded to make le mi zdani apply to both **cadzu** and **klama**.\n\n**se gu do gi nai mi bajra le do ckule** _Whether or not you, then not I, run\nto your school_ or _I won't run to your school no matter if you do or not_\n\nThe tanru-internal equivalent of gV is gu'V. These are exactly the same,\nexcept that they are exclusively tanru-internal, and that they bind a selbri\nto the **gi** tighter than normal tanru-grouping, but weaker than explicit\nbinding-sumti:\n\n**la xanz.krt. gu'e merko gi dotco nanmu** is equivalent to\n\n**la xanz.krt. merko je dotco nanmu**\n\nAnd so you've read page up and page down just to get the necessary knowledge\nin order to be able to learn how to ask _Would you like milk or sugar in your\ncoffee?_ in Lojban. Simply place a question logical connective instead of\nanother logical connective, and like **ma** , it asks the listener to fill in\na correct response. Unfortunately, these question-logical connectives don't\nalways match the morphological pattern of the logical connectives they ask\nfor:\n\n    **ji** = _Logical connective question: Asks for a sumti logical connective (A)_\n    **je'i** = _Logical connective question: Asks for a tanru-internal selbri logical connective (JA)_\n    **gi'i** = _Logical connective question: Asks for a bridi-tail logical connective (GIhA)_\n    **ge'i** = _Logical connective question: Asks for a forethought all-but tanru internal logical connective (GA)_\n    **gu'i** = _Logical connective question: Asks for a forethought only tanru internal logical connective (GUhA)_\n\nSo... how would you ask if the persons wants milk or sugar in her coffee?\n\n    **ladru** = _x 1 is/contains milk from source x2_\n    **sakta** = _x 1 is/contains sugar from source x2 of composition x3_\n\nPossible answer: **sakta je'i ladru le do ckafi** though I guess something\nmore English and less elegant could also suffice like **do djica lenu lo sakta\nji lo ladru cu nenri le do ckafi**\n\n## Lesson 26: Non-logical connectives\n\nThe word \"logical\" in \"logical connective\" refers to the association a logical\nconnective has with a truth function. Not all useful connectives can be\ndefined through a truth function, however, and so there are other connectives\nbeside the logical ones.\n\nThe meaning of a logical connective is defined the same as two different bridi\nconnected with that logical connective. For instance, **mi nitcu do .a la\n.djan.** is defined to be equivalent to **mi nitcu do .i ja mi nitcu la\n.djan.**. This definition is useful to bear in mind, because it implies that\nsometimes, sumti cannot be connected with logical connectives without chaning\nthe meaning. Consider the sentence: \"Jack and Joe wrote this play.\" One\nattempt at a translation would be: **ti draci fi la .djak. e la .djous.**\n\n    **draci** = _x 1 is a drama/play about x2 by writer/dramatist x3 for audience x4 with actors x5_\n\nThe problem with this translation is that it means **ti draci la .djak. ije ti\ndraci la .djous.** , which is not really true. Neither Jack nor Joe wrote it,\nthey did so together. What we want here is of course a mass, and some way to\njoin Jack and Joe in one mass. This has little to do with a truth function so\nwe must use a non-logical connective, which are of selma'o JOI. We'll return\nto this Jack and Joe-problem in a little - first: Four of the known JOI:\n\nThe Lojban connective joins sumti and forms a:\n\nThe functions of these words are simple: **lo'i remna jo'u lo'i gerku**\nconsiders both the set of humans and the set of dogs distributively (as\nindividuals). Remember from lesson twenty-two (quantifiers) that\n\"distributivity\" means that what is true for the group is also true for each\nof the individuals alone. Similarly **loi ro gismu ce'o loi ro lujvo ce'o loi\nro fu'ivla** is a sequence consisting of the mass of all gismu, followed by\nthe mass of all lujvo, followed by the mass of all fu'ivla. As with all of the\nJOI which has an inherent order, **se** may be put before **ce'o** to inverse\nthe order: \"A **ce'o** B\" is the same as \"B se **ce'o** A\". How can you\ncorrectly translate \"Jack and Joe wrote this play\"? Answer:  **ti draci fi la\n.djak. joi la .djous.** The cmavo of JOI are very flexible: They can act both\nas sumti connectives and tanru-internal connectives, so they can be used to\nconnect sumti, selbri and bridi. This flexibility means that one must be\ncareful to use famyma'o correctly when using a JOI. What is wrong with the\nbridi **lo dotco jo'u mi cu klama la dotco gugde**? Answer:  **jo'u** is put\nafter a selbri, so it expects a selbri after it to connect to, but none is\nfound. Had a **ku** been present before the connective, it would have been\ngrammatical If several JOI are used, **bo** and/or **ke** may be used to\noverride the usual left-grouping:  **mi joi do ce'o la .djak. joi bo la\n.djous. cu pu'o ci'erkei damba lei xunre**  \n _Me and you, and then Jack and Joe are about the play against the reds_  \n---  \n  \nContrast it with\n\n**mi joi do ce'o la .djak. joi la .djous. cu pu'o ci'erkei damba lei xunre**  \n _First me and you, then Jack will together with Joe play against the reds._  \n---  \n  \nConnecting bridi with JOI can make some interesting implications of the\nrelationship between the bridi:\n\n**la .djak. morsi ri'a lo nu ri dzusoi .i joi le jemja'a po ri cu bebna**  \n _Jack is dead because he was a infantry soldier and his general was an\nidiot._  \n---  \n  \nimplying that these two bridi massed together was the physical cause of his\ndeath: Had he only been in an armored vehicle or with a competent commander,\nhe might had survived.\n\n    **dzusoi** = _x 1 is an infantry soldier of army x2_\n    **jemja'a** = _x 1 is a general of army x2 in function x3_\n    **bebna** = _x 1 is foolish/idiotic in property/aspect x2_\n\nNon-logical connectives may also be negated with **nai** , indicating that\nsome other connective is appropriate: **lo djacu ce'o nai .e'o lo ladru cu\ncavyfle fi le mi tcati** \\- \"Please don't pour first water then milk in my\ntea\". This, of course, says nothing about which connective is appropriate -\none might guess **se ce'o** (first milk, then water), only to find out that\n**.e nai** (only water, no milk at all) was the correct one.\n\n    **cavyfle** = _x 1, consisting of x2, flows into x3 from x4_\n\nJust like a logical connective is a plausible negation of a non-logical\nconnective, answers to questions of the type **ji** or **je'i** can be both\nlogical and non-logical: A: **ladru je'i sakta le do ckafi** B: **se ce'o**\n(\"Milk or sugar in you coffee?\" \"First the latter, then the former\"). In this\ncase **ce** would make no sense at all, since sets can't be contained in\ncoffee, and **joi** (both mixed together) would mean the same as **jo'u**\n(both of them), unless the respondant preferred unmixed sugar in his coffee.\n\nThe fifth JOI I present here is a bit of an oddball:\n\n    **fa'u** = _Non-logical connective: Unmixed ordered distribution (A and B, respectively)_\n\nWhen only one **fa'u** is placed within a bridi (or several bridi connected\ntogether with connectors), **fa'u** may be assumed to be identical to\n**jo'u**. When several **fa'u** is used within one bridi, however, the\nconstructs before **fa'u** each apply to each other, and the constructs after\n**fa'u** each apply to each other. Let's have an example:\n\n**mi fa'u do rusko fa'u kadno**  \n _You and I are Russian and Canadian_  \n---  \n  \nimplying that **mi** goes with **rusko** and **do** goes with **kadno** , and\nimplying nothing about any other combination. Of course, in this example, it\nwould be much easier to say **mi rusko .i do kadno**.\n\nThese last three JOI connects two sets to make new sets:\n\n    **jo'e** = _A union B_\n    **ku'a** = _A intersection B_\n    **pi'u** = _Cross product of A and B_\n\nThese are probably not very useful for the average Lojbanist, but I might as\nwell include them here.\n\nThe first one, **jo'e** , contains all the members of set A and those of set\nB. If anything is a member of both sets, they are not counted twice.\n\nA set made with **ku'a** makes a new set from two sets. This new set contains\nonly those members which are in both sets.\n\n**pi'u** is a little more complicated. A set \"A **pi'u** B\" contains all the\npossible combinations of \"a **ce'o** b\", where a is a member of A and b is a\nmember of B. It is thus a set of sequences of members. If, for instance, set A\ncontained the members p and q, and set B contained members f and g, then A\n**pi'u** B would be a set consisting of the four members p **ce'o** f, p\n**ce'o** g, q **ce'o** f and q **ce'o** g.\n\n## Lesson 27: Lojban logicː **da** , **bu'a** , **zo'u** , and terms\n\nHere we are starting to talk about advanced Lojban. The Lojban in this and\nfollowing lessons is rarely relevant when speaking Lojban in normal contexts,\nbut it pops up quite often when speaking about language and logic.\n\nThese corners of Lojban is for the most part experimental, new or complex, so\nyou should expect a lot of changing definitions, outdated definitions,\ndisagreements and misunderstandings on the part of the author of this text.\nSorry about that.\n\nThe stated topic of this lesson needs some justification: This lesson is not\nreally about how do to logic in Lojban, since firstly, logic is presumably the\nsame in all languages, and secondly, actually teaching logic would be totally\nimpractical in one single lesson. Rather, this lesson explains some constructs\nwhich resemble those which logicians use. It turns out they have a remarkable\nwide range of uses in Lojban.\n\nGetting involved in the more obscure details of these logical constructs can\nbe mind-warpingly difficult, and there will always be some disagreement in the\ncorners of this part of the language.\n\nLearning these logical constructs requires one to learn a bit about constructs\nwhich are not logical in nature. Let's begin with **zo'u**\n\n    **zo'u** = _Separates prenex from bridi_\n\nBefore any **zo'u** is the prenex, after **zo'u** is the bridi. Informally, a\nprenex is a place in front of the bridi, where you put a bunch of terms. A\nterm is an English word given to some kinds of Lojban constructs: Sumti,\nsumtcita with or without sumti attached, **na ku** and an abomination called\n_termsets_ , which I refuse to include in these lessons. The prenex is not\npart of the bridi, but any terms put inside it gives us information about the\nbridi. One can, for example, use it to state a topic as shown thus:\n\n**lo pampe'o je nai speni zo'u mi na zanru** \\- \"Concerning lovers who are not\nspouses: I do not approve\". The benefits of kind of sentence structuring is\nquestionable, but it's always good to have some variation to play with.\nFurthermore, constructing sentences this way resembles Mandarin (and other\nlanguages) closely, meaning it might seem more intuitive for speakers of that\nlanguage.\n\n    **pampe'o** = _x 1 is a lover of x2_\n\n    **zanru** = _x 1 approves of x2 (plan, event or action)_\n\nOf course, the relation between the terms in the prenex and the bridi is\nvague. One can imagine any sumti in the prenex bearing the same relevance to\nthe bridi as if they were put in the bridi after a **do'e** sumtcita, and any\nsumtcita in the prenex doing pretty much the same as if they were in the\nbridi. It is quite possible to put terms in prenexes without any clear hints\nas to how the term may relate to the bridi:\n\n**le vi gerku zo'u mi to'e nelci lo cidjrpitsa** \\- \"Concerning this dog here:\nI dislike pizza.\" It leaves you guessing about the reason for mentioning the\ndog.\n\n    **cidjrpitsa** = _x 1 is pizza with topping/ingredients x2_\n\nIf the prenex contains **na ku** , it's pretty straight forward: The entire\nbridi is negated, just as if the bridi itself began with **na ku**.\n\nSo how long does a prenex last? It lasts until the following bridi is\nterminated. If that is not desired, there are two ways to make it apply to\nseveral bridi: One is to put some kind of connective after the **.i**\nseparating the bridi, and another method is to simply include all of the text\nin **tu'e** ... **tu'u** -brackets. These brackets work pretty much by gluing\nall the bridi together and makes all sorts of construct apply to several\nbridi.\n\nNow that we covered **zo'u** , the first \"logical\" words we can use it with\nare these:\n\n    **da** = _logically quantified existential sumka'i 1_\n\n    **de** = _logically quantified existential sumka'i 2_\n\n    **di** = _logically quantified existential sumka'i 3_\n\nThese words are all the same, like the mathematical variables x, y and z. Once\nyou have defined them, however, they keep refering to the same thing. These\nwords are defined in the prenex of bridi, meaning that when the prenex stop\napplying, the definition of these three words are cancelled.\n\nThe words **da** , **de** and **di** can refer to literally any sumti, which\nmakes them kind of useless unless restricted in some way. The first and\nforemost way to restrict them is to quantify them: They are not called\n\"logically quantified existential sumka'i\" for nothing. They are sumka'i, they\nare most useful when quantified, and they are existential. What does it mean,\nbeing \"existential\"? It means that by default, they are used to assert that\nsomething exists. An example:\n\nThe statement **pa da zo'u da gerku** has **pa da** in the prenex, which means\n\"There exists one thing such that it:\", and then **da** , now defined, is used\nin the bridi **da gerku**. Translated to English, this means: \"There exists\none thing which is a dog\". This is obviously false, there are around\n400,000,000 of them in the world. If **da** and its sisters are not\nquantified, the number **su'o** is the default. Thus **da zo'u da gerku**\nmeans \"There exist at least one thing which is a dog\", which is true. Notice\nhere, that any quantification must be more or less exact in order to be true:\nOf course one dog exists, but in Lojban, **pa da zo'u da gerku** means not\nonly that does one dog exists, but also that no more than one does.\n\nThere are a few specific rules to these existential sumka'i:\n\n\\- If the quantifier **ro** is used before **da** , it instead refers to \"all\nwhich exists\".\n\n\\- Importantly, the usage of an existential sumka'i only asserts that such a\nthing exists _in the domain of truth where it's used_. Thus, in the sentence\n**so'e verba cu krici lo du'u su'o da crida** , does not state **da crida** ,\nsince its \"domain of truth\" is only inside the du'u-abstraction. Generally\nspeaking, abstractions contain their own domain of truth, so using **da** and\nfriends inside an abstraction is usually safe.\n\n\\- If the same variable is quantified several times, the first quantification\nis the one which sticks: Any later quantified instance of that variable can\nrefer only to things which are also being referred to by the first instance of\nthat variable, and any later non-quantified instance of that variable will\ngain the first quantifier. To use an example: **ci da zo'u re da barda .ije da\npelxu** means \"There exists three things such that two of them are big and all\nthree are yellow\". **re da** , being after **ci da** , can only refer to two\nof the already stated three things. When **da** appears without a quantifier,\n**ci** is assumed.\n\n\\- If there are several terms in the prenex, the terms are always read left to\nright. Sometimes, this matters: **ro da de zo'u da prami de** means\n\"Concerning all the things X that exists, concerning at least one thing Y: X\nloves Y\". This is the same as \"All things love at least one thing.\", where the\n\"thing(s)\" can be anything, including the thing itself. Note here that **de**\ncan refer to different things for each **da** \\- the thing which is referred\nto by **de** is dependent on the **da** , since it came before it in the\nprenex, therefore each thing might love something different. If we switched\nthe places of **da** and **de** in the prenex, a different result would arise:\n**de ro da zo'u da prami de** = \"Concerning at least one thing Y, concerning\nall X which exists: X loves Y\", meaning \"There exists at least one thing which\neverything loves\".\n\nOf course, both claims are completely false. There are many things which loves\nnothing - rocks, or abstract concepts, for example. Likewise, it's impossible\nto concieve of something which everything loves, since \"everything\" also\nencompasses non-sentient things. We need better ways to restrict what these\nvariables can point to. One good way of doing it is to make them the subject\nof a relative clause:\n\n**ro di poi remna zo'u birka di** = \"Concerning all X that exists, which is\nhuman: X has one or more arms.\" or \"All humans have arms\", which is true, at\nleast when speaking in a potential, timeless sense.\n\n    **birka** = _x 1 is an arm of x2_\n\nWhen restricting claims using this kind of logical \"existential\" variable,\nit's very important to remember that unless there is an explicit **no** or\n**ro** as a quantifier, these kind of statements always imply that there\n_actually exists_ something which can be referred to by **da**. Therefore, any\nkind of non-negated statement where **da** points to something which does not\nexist is false.\n\n**ro da** was also originally defined to imply existence, but is now usually\ntaken to be equivalent to **no da naku** , \"nothing exists that does not ...\".\nHaving this equivalence hold no matter what the formula evaluates to is seen\nas more important than having {ro} mirror natural language use exactly.\n\nIn fact, you don't really need the prenex to define the variables. You can use\nthem directly as sumti in the bridi, and quantify them there. You only need to\nquantify them the first time they appear, though. Thus, the sentence about\nhumans having arms could be turned into **birka ro di poi remna**. The order\nof the variables still matters though, and so the prenex can be used to avoid\nhaving to mess up your bridi to place the variables in the correct order. When\nhaving more variables, a prenex is usually a good idea.\n\nThe second kind of logical words are basically the same as the three we have\nalready been though, but these are brika'i instead of sumka'i:\n\n    **bu'a** = _logically quantified existential brika'i 1_\n\n    **bu'e** = _logically quantified existential brika'i 2_\n\n    **bu'i** = _logically quantified existential brika'i 3_\n\nThese work pretty much the same way as the other three, but there are a few\npoints which are important to mention:\n\nSince only terms can go in the prenex, these brika'i need to have a quantifier\nin order to make them into sumti. When quantified in the prenex, however, the\nquantifier works very different from quantifiers with normal selbri: Instead\nof quantifying the amount of things which fits the x1 of the selbri variable,\nit directly quantifies the amount of selbri which applies. Again, the default\nquantifier is **so'u**. Thus, instead of **re bu'a zo'u** meaning \"Concerning\ntwo things which is in relationship X:\", it means \"Concerning two\nrelationships X:\"\n\nIt's probably good to see an example of **bu'a** put to practice:\n\n**ro da bu'a la .bab.** = \"Considering all X which exists: X is in at least\none relationship with Bob\" = \"Everything is related to Bob in at least one\nway.\". Notice again the order matters: **su'o bu'a ro da zo'u da bu'a la\n.bab.** means: \"There is at least one relationship such that everything that\nexists is in that relationship with Bob\". The first statement is true - for\nany one thing, one can indeed make up some selbri which relates any guy called\nBob and it. But I'm not sure the latter is true - that one can make a selbri\nwhich can relate anything, no matter what it is, and Bob.\n\nLet's have an example which quantifies selbri:\n\n**ci'i bu'e zo'u mi bu'e do** \\- \"Concerning an infinite amount of\nrelationships: I am in all those relationship with you.\" or \"There exists an\ninfinite amount of relationships between us\"\n\nYou can't quantify the selbri variables in the bridi itself, though. Then it\nwill act as a sumti: **mi ci'i bu'a do** is not a bridi. There are some\nsituation where this will become problematic - lesson twenty-nine will teach\nhow to overcome those problems.\n\n## Lesson 28: Types\n\nThis lesson along with the following three lessons will be on semantics - how\nto interpret the meaning of certain constructs. This lesson is on the meaning\nof different types of sumti, and will get philosophical and a bit hazy. The\nfollowing two will be on abstractions, which, even though you already became\nfamiliar with them twenty-two lessons ago, will become more technical as I\nattempt to explain their semantic and grammatical properties.\n\nTeaching (and learning) semantics is much more tricky than teaching grammar,\nespecially in Lojban, where grammar is black-or-white, but semantics isn't.\nTherefore, I find it necessary to repeat an earlier disclaimer the following\nis not official, but rather an (educated) opinion on the language.\n\nBad grammar is easy to spot in Lojban - in fact it's unambiguously correct or\nnot. In contrast, saying that a jufra is semantically wrong is the same as\nsaying that the speaker is using Lojban to think wrongly about the world. It's\nnot saying \"You can't say X\" as much as \"You can't interpret X in this way.\nYou should interpret it this way\". Placing these restrictions on composing and\nunderstanding language is a slippery slope leading to restrictions on\ncreativity, and even presupposing of certain metaphysical viewpoints while\nexcluding others.\n\nThen why include semantic standards in a textbook? Shouldn't any speaker be\nfree to say anything, and any listener be free to let that speech mean\nwhatever they want?\n\nThis is a matter of measure. Given that extreme, that is, if no semantic\nstandards were set, everything could mean anything, and all communication\nwould be meaningless. In any language which aims to facilitate communication,\none must be able to express oneself in such a way that one can trust that\none’s message is interpreted in the desired way. Semantic rules of Lojban do\nnot exist in order to prevent people from saying A. They exist to prevent\npeople from saying B and having others think they meant A.\n\nThis lesson is on types. The word _type_ , informally translated to **klesi**\n, is used by Lojbanists to describe the existential nature of the things sumti\ndescribe. This nature is, and must be, the same as the nature of the things\ndescribed by other languages such as English. However, in Lojban, the\ndifferent ways of making sumti denote which type a sumti belongs to, so while\nthe exact natures of sumti can be ignored in English, Lojbanists have to deal\nwith them.\n\nWhen speaking of types, Lojbanists often mention what type a sumti _really\nis_. When beginning from the beginning, we have to remember that this\ncertainty is not philosophically well grounded. Taking a materialistic\nviewpoint, the natural world of particles and waves does not correspond well\nwith human understanding of say, hatred, which is not defined by any specific\nparticles, nor any specific brain activity. It is a purely abstract concept.\nSimilarly, in an extreme inductionist viewpoint, such as that taken by Hume,\nall we humans experience are subjective impressions over time - a long string\nof events, or, some people argue, a bunch of qualia (This is _green_. This is\n_crispy_. This is _round_. This is _tasty_. => \"This is an apple\".) This\nviewpoint, however, does not correspond well to human understanding of say, a\ncat, whose existence must be presumed to continue even when it invokes no\nqualia in humans, whose qualia vary among different cats, and whose death\nsmoothly strips it of its catlike qualia.\n\nIn other words, while one can take philosophically consistent worldviews where\nobjects and concepts don't exist, such world views are unfruitful for\nconducting human affairs: In our lives, we simply need to refer to objects,\nand pretend that they actually exist as such. One famous story tells of a\nphilosopher, Samuel Johnson, who, frustrated about the philosophical soundness\nand un-refutability of a fellow philosopher's belief that the physical world\ndoes not exist, furiously kicks a rock yelling, \"I refute it _thus!_ \"\n\nIn Lojban, most sumti are made from selbri one way or the other, which means\nthat at the core of most sumti lies a selbri, an action, something which\nsomething _does_. The Sun is not usually referred to as **la solri** , \"The\nSun\", but often **lo solri** , \"something which is being a sun\". There are\nmany confusing philosophical implications of this: As stated before, it's hazy\nat best what it means \"to cat\" and when something _begins catting_ or \"stops\ncatting\". A fictional language with similar properties is described in a neat\nshort story, \"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\" (where \"The Moon rose over the\nocean\" is phrased using similar verb/adverb-derived nouns: \"Upward behind the\nonstreaming it mooned\"). In that short story, the language is about to lead to\nthe collapse of society because the worldview which such a language implies is\nunfit for dealing with the realities of Earth.\n\nThe take home point of all this is: Precise definitions of the different types\nof sumti are impossible, because these categories do not correspond to the\nreal world. Nonetheless, we need these categories when speaking.\n\nThere may possibly be an infinite amount of types, but I'll go through the\nones which are dealt with most often in Lojban:\n\nMaterial objects are perhaps the easiest to understand, even though they're\nhard to defend philosophically. They always have a place in both time and\nspace, but they're considered to be a constant existing through time. That is,\nobjects are not considered temporally: A banana carries with it its unchanging\nbanana-ness even as it ages, until it begins breaking down and stop being a\nbanana at all. If one could freeze time for all bananas, they would stay\nbananas during that frozen time.\n\nEvents are, like objects, places in space and time, but events are considered\nas unfolding over time: The temporal aspect is as important as the spacial. A\nbanana can be considered an event, but in that case, the event of being a\nbanana is composed of the changes the banana undergoes over time, whereas what\nmakes a banana an object is all that which doesn't change. Freezing time would\nalso freeze the event of being a banana.\n\nFunctions are a term used by a few Lojbanists to describe a group of types.\nAll functions are abstract concepts and as such don't really exist in the real\nworld on their own. The nuts and bolt of functions is the subject of lesson\nthirty; here, we focus on their semantics alone. There are a few types of\nfunctions:\n\nSelbri are something you're already well familiar with. It describes an act of\ndoing or being. **crino** understood as a selbri means \"being green\",\n**darxi** means \"to hit\". A selbri on its own is devoid of the sumti who's\ndoing or being that selbri. As such, they're divorced from any particular\ninstance of being green or hitting, and can therefore be understood as a kind\nof generalized events. They're used for sentences where no particular instance\nof that selbri being applied comes to mind. For instance, if I'm looking\nforward to my wedding next Wednesday, I'm thinking about some event placed in\nspace and time (even if the wedding never actually takes place for some sad\nreason), whereas if I'm saying that I'd like to become married one day, I\ndesire the act of marriage, and thus I desire the selbri, or rather, that the\nselbri be applied to me.\n\nAmounts have almost the same grammatical properties as selbri, as you'll see\nin two lessons. Semantically, however, they're quite distinct. An amount is\n_how much something fits a selbri_ , which is something completely different\nfrom the selbri itself. An amount is some kind of number, or can be\nrepresented by some number, exact or inexact, no matter whether what is\nquantified is practically measurable.\n\nThere is some disagreement about whether it's correct to use an amount\nabstraction to quantify something which is in principle unmeasurable. Thus,\nthe amount of my greenness is certainly valid, since that could be measured by\nsay, a digital camera, but speaking about the amount of me being Bob's friend\nmay not be accepted philosophically. A great example which demonstrates the\ndifference between amounts and selbri when applied to specific sumti is the\nfollowing: \"I change in blackness\": When \"blackness\" is considered a selbri,\nit means that change from being black to not being black or the other way\naround. When \"blackness\" is considered an amount, it means my skin turns more\nor less black (as it does during the winter when there's little sunlight).\n\nConcepts are maybe functions and maybe they're not, depending on who you ask.\nTheir position as maybe-functions is explained in lesson thirty. Concepts,\nunlike selbri and amounts, cannot be applied to sumti. There can be no talk of\n_fitting a concept_ , like there can be of whether or not you are _fitting a\nselbri_ or measuring the amount of _fitting a selbri_. A concept does not\nexist in the real world. A concept is not even represented in the real world,\nlike amounts or selbri can be when they’re applied to sumti. A concept, say\n_warfare_ , exists only in the minds of people, and is understood as the\nmeaning of the word _war_. Thus \"love\" understood as a concept is the idea of\nwhat love is, no matter who loves and who is being loved.\n\nPerhaps an example can demonstrate the difference between amounts, selbri and\nconcepts:\n\nIn \"I like loving\" and \"I like being loved\", we are speaking of a selbri.\n\nIn the sentence \"I like how much I love\", I like an amount, and when saying \"I\nlike love\", I refer to the concept of love.\n\nBridi is a type which you're also familiar with. A bridi is certainly not a\nfunction, but it does bear some relation to functions, as we'll see later.\nBridi themselves are imaginary; they exist not in the real world, but inside\ntexts, the next type to explain. However, bridi are not composed of whichever\nspecific symbols are used to express them - because bridi are imaginary,\ndifferent sentences may express the same bridi. It can be that the sentences\nare in different languages, that the word order is changed, or that different\nwords are used to refer to the same sumti. Thus **mi do prami** /**mi prami\ndo** , \"I love you\", **mi ko prami** and **do mi prami** (when spoken by the\nperson to which **do** refers in the first sentence) all refer to the same\nbridi. Bridi always have their full place structure filled by something with a\nnon-zero value.\n\nThe concept of a text is close intertwined with the concept of a bridi. All\nbridi are contained in texts, though not all texts contain bridi. Indeed, one\nmight define a text as something that can contain a bridi, but this can easily\nlead to circular definitions when attempting to define what bridi are. The\ncurrent understanding of what things should be considered texts is vague at\nbest. Like bridi, texts are something ethereal, something we can imagine exist\nin a realm outside the physical world. While these lessons certainly are a\ntext, the text is not made of the paper these lessons are printed on, nor the\nmagnetic fields which constitutes the bytes it's stored on. Those physical\nmedia only _represent_ the text. But what exactly can represent a text? Words,\ncertainly. But what about body language? And do actions really speak _texts_\nlouder than words? This is not an issue I'll attempt to answer or even give a\nshot in these lessons.\n\nSets are much easier to deal with. They're a kind of meta-type: A imaginary\nbox, in which a group of sumti is packed into. This box has very little to do\nwith what's inside it. A big set does not mean that the things in the set are\nbig, but that there are many things in the set. Sets have very few properties,\ntherefore sets are only used when speaking about the number of things in a\ngiven category, the number of things shared between several categories, the\ncriteria for including things in the category etc.\n\nThe last used type is the truth value. I've only seen it in use a handful of\ntimes, and only include it here because it'll be relevant when discussing a\ncertain abstraction in the next lesson. A truth value is some verdict that a\nbridi is true, false, or anywhere in between. The nature of a truth value is a\nverdict, \"True\", \"False\", \"Mostly true\" or the like. It's often represented by\na number, such as 0 (false), 1 (true) or 0.5 (halfway true), but this a simply\na representation of the truth value, and not the value itself. One might as\nwell represent it by a color, ranging from red to blue.\n\n## Lesson 29: Semantics of simple abstractions\n\nHaving acquired a terminology suitable for the discussion of types, we can now\nmore easily take on the semantics of abstractions. Most often, an abstraction\nis merely a bridi considered as a certain type. We begin with what I consider\nthe simplest of abstractions:\n\n    **nu** = _x 1 is an event of BRIDI happening_\n\nYou're already familiar with this word and how it's used. A **nu**\n-abstraction is always an event, and as such, it's situated in one particular\ntime and space. Thus:\n\n**mi catlu lo nu lo prenu cu darxi lo gerku**  \n _I watch a person hitting a dog_  \n---  \n  \nis a proper event, whereas\n\n**mi kakne lo nu bajra fi lo mi birka**  \n _I can running on my arms._  \n---  \n  \nis wrong, because no particular event of running is implied: The running\nyou're able to do is a selbri - a generalized event, and the Lojban sentence\nabove should sound as badly phrased as its English translation.\n\nThere are many ways to view an event, and so there are four other abstractors,\nwhich all also create events. The meaning of these abstractions are all\ncovered by **nu** , but more specific. I'll go through them all here:\n\n    **mu'e** = _x 1 is a point-like event of BRIDI happening_\n    **za'i** = _x 1 is a state of BRIDI being true_\n    **pu'u** = _x 1 is a process of BRIDI unfolding through stages x2_\n    **zu'o** = _x 1 is an activity of BRIDI consisting of the repeated event of x2_\n\nThe understanding of these abstractors is tied to the understanding of event\ncontours. **mu'e** is akin to the event contour **co'i** in the sense that\nboth treat the bridi as point-like in time and space:\n\n**lo mu'e mi kanro binxo cu se djica mi**  \n _Me becoming healthy is desired by me_  \n---  \n  \nhas the semantic meaning that the process of becoming healthy is not being\nconsidered. If it consists of painful chemotherapy, it is plausible that this\nprocess is not desired at all. _Becoming healthy_ , in a point-like sense is\ndesired, however.\n\n**za'i** is like the event contour **ca'o** in the sense that **lo za'i\nBRIDI** begins to apply when the bridi begins and sharply ends when the bridi\nceases to be true, much like **ca'o**.\n\n**za'o za'i mi kanro binxo** means that the state of me becoming healthy took\ntoo much time; that the time between my health beginning to improve and be\nactually being healthy was long-winded.\n\nThe actual treatment is perhaps better caught by **pu'u** , which, like event\ncontours in general, puts emphasis on the entire event as unfolding through\ntime. **.ii ba zi co'a pu'u mi kanro binxo .oi** expresses fear that the\npainful process of becoming healthy is about to begin. The x2 is filled by a\nsequence of stages, which can be made by interspacing the stages with the non-\nlogical connective **ce'o** : **ze'u pu'u mi kanro binxo kei lo nu mi facki\nce'o lo nu mi jai tolsti ce'o lo nu mi renvi** means _something is a long\nprocess of me becoming healthy consisting of the stages A ) I find out B )\nsomething about me begins C ) I endure._\n\nFinally, the semantics of **zu'o** treats the abstraction as consisting of a\nnumber of repeated actions:\n\n**lo za'a zo'u darxi lo tanxe cu rinka lo ca mu'e porpi**  \n _The observed activity of beating the box caused its current brokenness._  \n---  \n  \nis more accurate than the similar sentence using **nu** , because **zu'o**\nmakes it explicit that it was the repeating of the action of beating, not a\nparticular instance of beating which broke the box.\n\nThe x2 of **zu'o** is either one event or a sequence which is repeated. To be\nunnecessarily explicit, we could have stated that the cause of the current\nbrokenness was **lo zo'u darxi lo tanxe kei lonu lafti lo grana kei ku ce'o\nlonu muvgau lo grana lo tanxe kei ku ce'o** ... and so on.\n\nNote the difference between **mu'e bajra** , **za'i bajra** , **pu'u bajra** ,\n**zu'o bajra** and **nu bajra** : The point-like event of running puts\nemphasis on the event happening, but nothing else. The state of running begins\nwhen the runner begins and stops when the runner stops. The process of running\nconsists of a warm-up, keeping a steady speed, and the final sprint. The\nactivity of running consists the cycles of lifting one foot, moving it\nforward, dropping it down, repeat with the other foot. All of these aspects\nare simultaneously covered by the event of running, **nu bajra**.\n\nAnother type of abstractor is the experience abstractor, **li'i** :\n\n    **li'i** = _Experience abstractor: x 1 is x2's internal experience of BRIDI_\n\nAn experience can be considered an event type. It has almost the same\nattributes: It's placed in space, there's focus on the time over which it\nunfolds, and it's not a function.\n\nUnlike event abstractions, however, an experience is explicitly mental - a\n**li'i** -abstraction cannot be said to exist outside the mind of a person.\nThis difference is purely semantic, and exchanging event and experience\nabstractors would not be considered a type failure in the same sense as **mi\nkakne lo nu...**. It might not make sense, as in **lo kacma cu vreji lo li'i\nlo mi pendo cu cliva kei mi** \\- _A camera recorded my experience of my friend\nleaving_. But then again, cinema is dependent on cameras being able to record\nthe actors' emotions.\n\nIt does, I think, make complete sense to write **mi ciksi lo li'i lo mi pendo\ncu cliva kei mi** , **lo li'i lo mi tunba cu morsi cu mukti lo nu mi catra** ,\nand the like.\n\n**li'i** is derived from **lifri** , and is indeed a **se lifri** \\- an\nexperience.\n\nA **du'u** -abstraction is probably the other kind of abstraction you're used\nto seeing, beside **nu**.\n\n    **du'u** = _Bridi abstractor: x 1 is the bridi of BRIDI, as represented by text x2_\n\nAccording to the standard, abstractions like truths, lies, things being\ndiscovered or things being believed are all pure bridi:\n\n**.ui sai zi facki lo du'u zi citka lo cidjrpitsa**  \n _Yes! I just found out that pizza will be eaten soon!_  \n---  \n**mi krici lo du'u la turni cu zbasu pi ro lo munje zi'o**  \n _I believe The Lord created all of the universe._  \n---  \n  \nWhat is being discovered or believed is the truth of an abstract bridi, so\n**du'u** is appropriate.\n\nAs you can see from the definition of ‘'du'u _, the x2 of**du'u** is used for\nthe text in which the bridi is contained. As stated before, the nature of\ntexts is hard to nail down, but in practice, **du'u'** s x2 can be used to\nexpress indirect quotation:_\n\n**.ue do pu cusku ku'i lo se du'u do nelci lo ckafi**  \n _Oh! But you said that you liked coffee!_  \n---  \n  \nOut of obligation, this lesson will include the truth value abstractor,\n**jei**. Let's see the definition:\n\n    **jei** = _Truth abstraction: x 1 is the truth value of BRIDI under epistemology x2_\n\n**jei** is rarely used, not because truth abstractions are infrequently\nneeded, but because most Lojbanists use other mechanisms to obtain them. The\nreal use of **jei** is whenever a truth value which is not \"true\" or \"false\"\nis needed, i.e. practically never. I'll give a couple of examples:\n\n**mi di'i pensi lo jei mi merko**  \n _I often think about whether I am American or not._  \n---  \n  \n(contrast with _I often think about how American I am_ , which uses an amount\nabstraction, not a truth value)\n\n**li pi bi jei la tinjin cu mikce**  \n _It's 80% true that Tindjin is a doctor._  \n---  \n  \n(whatever that might mean)\n\nTo conclude this lesson, the abstractor **su'u** is a universal abstractor,\nwhose x2 can be used to specify how the abstraction should be considered - for\nexample, which type the abstraction is. It has already been defined, but we\nmight as well do it again:\n\n    **su'u** = _Universal abstractor x 1 is the abstraction on BRIDI considered as x2 / x1 is the abstraction of BRIDI of type x2._\n\nThe idea of this abstraction is easy, so I'll just give a few examples of it\nin use and leave it at that:\n\nThe English phrase _that I love you_ is definitely a sumti, since it's meant\nto function as a subject or object in a sentence. It's also clearly made from\nan abstraction. It can therefore be translated **lo su'u mi do prami**.\nWithout the context of the English sentence, though, it's hard to guess what\nkind of abstraction was meant. _I will die happy by the time that I love you._\ntreats the abstraction as an event happening in time. _The truth is that I\nlove you._ treats the abstraction like a bridi, which can be considered true\nor false. \"You don't know how much I love you\" treats the (nearly identical)\nabstraction as an amount. Using the second sumti place of su'u, these can be\nexplicitly differentiated:\n\n**lo su'u mi do prami kei be lo fasnu** is an event.\n\n**lo su'u mi do prami kei be lo bridi** is a bridi.\n\n**lo su'u mi do prami kei be lo klani** is an amount.\n\nUsing **su'u** this way, the semantic (though not grammatical) range of all\nabstractors can be covered. More usually, though, other abstractors are used.\n\nFinally, Lojbanist J. Cowan translated the title of the book _The Crucifixion\nof Jesus Considered As A Downhill Bicycle Race_ as **lo su'u la .iecuas.\nkuctai selcatra kei be lo sa'ordzifa'a ke nalmatma'e sutyterjvi**.\n\n## Lesson 30: Semantics of functions\n\nFunctions are a group of two-three types of abstractions. The term's not\nofficial, but I'll use it here anyway.\n\nThe definition of functions is closely related to the neat little word\n**ce'u**. **ce'u** is a sumka'i which fills one sumti place. It's only found\nusage inside abstractions which are also functions. All functions can have at\nleast one **ce'u** somewhere in the abstraction - that's what makes them\nfunctions. The **ce'u** can be elided, in which case it's most often assumed\nto fill the first elided sumti place of the function, unless context provides\na more reasonable alternative.\n\nWhat does it actually do? Let's have a look at its definition:\n\n    **ce'u** = _Pseudo-quantifier binding a variable within an abstraction that represents an open place._\n\nWell, that wasn't very helpful, so let me try explaining it with another\napproach:\n\nPutting **ce'u** in a sumti place leaves the sumti place empty. The place is\nnot erased, like if you fill it with **zi'o** , but the place is not filled\nwith anything - not a specific thing, not a **zu'i** , not a **zo'e** ,\nnothing. In that manner, the empty sumti places are reminiscent of the x1, x2,\nand x3's we put in the sumti places of English definitions of brivla - marking\n\"This is where something else can be put\".\n\nThus **mi citka lo ti badna** is \"I eat this banana\", but **mi citka ce'u** is\n\"I eat X\".\n\nOf course, \"I eat X\" is meaningless unless that X is filled by something, and\nindeed the sentence **mi citka ce'u** is senseless in Lojban as well.\n\nIn order to put it to use, we need a function abstraction. We'll begin with\nthe most often-used: The selbri abstraction **ka**. Let's see its official\ngloss:\n\n    **ka** = _Property/quality abstractor (-ness); x 1 is quality/property exhibited by BRIDI._\n\nUnder the understanding which I will teach, this gloss is mildly misleading.\nInstead, **ka** should probably be glossed such:\n\n    **ka** = _Predicate/selbri abstractor: x 1 is the predicate/selbri of BRIDI (needs at least one open variable i.e. a \"ce'u\")_\n\nUsing a selbri abstraction, \"I eat X\" can make sense, as in the following\nexample:\n\n    **ckaji** = _x 1 is characterized by selbri x2_\n\n**lo ti badna cu ckaji lo ka mi citka ce'u** \\- \"This banana is characterized\nby the selbri: \"I eat X\"\", which may be rephrased as \"This banana fits the\nselbri: \"Being eaten by me\"\", which is of course equivalent to **mi citka lo\nti badna** \\- \"I eat this banana\".\n\nFor the statement to make sense, the sumti place held open by **ce'u**\nusually, but not always, must be filled by something. The main selbri of the\nstatement, in this case **ckaji** , gives us a clue how to fill the open sumti\nplace. Such selbri almost always fill it with a sumti from the main selbri.\nHow **ce'u** is given a non-zero value has been a subject of minor debate in\nLojbanistan, but the issue is more or less settled: **ce'u** keeps a sumti\nplace open, and the main selbri then fills it with something, and what fills\nthe place depends on the selbri in question.\n\nThough it often is, the **ce'u** place need not always be filled by the selbri\nin order for the abstraction to make sense: On its own, **lo ka ce'u te vecnu\nlo finpe** means: \"buying a fish\", or \"to buy a fish\". This can be used in a\nsentence without the selbri filling the ‘’ce’u’’ in:\n\n**lo se lisri cu srana lo ka ce'u te vecnu lo finpe** \\- \"The plot is about\nbuying a fish\". Here, **srana** does not apply anything to the **ce'u**\n-place, and the abstraction is instead seen as the selbri on its own.\n\nAn alternative way of explaining **ce'u** is by regarding the word as\nrepresenting variables in a lambda function. For instance, consider the\nsentence:\n\n**la .alis. cu djica lo ka ce'u te vecnu lo finpe** \\- \"Alice wants to buy a\nfish\"\n\nHere, the first argument of **djica** is the one who wants something, namely\nAlice. The second argument is the selbri that Alice wants to fulfill: Buying a\nfish.\n\nWe can view **ce'u** as a free variable, which then becomes bound by a lambda\nabstraction, namely **ka**. Now, **ka ce'u terve'u lo finpe** can be seen as a\nlambda function:\n\n` \\ x -> te vecnu(x,lo finpe,zo'e,zo'e)`,\n\nand in this case **djica** supplies the lambda function with Alice.\n\nLambdas can be stored, allowing them to be passed around and use them in\nvarious situations:\n\n**ca'e ko'a ka ce'u dansu .i mi ko'a ckaji .i do ko'a djica .i ma'a ko'a\nkakne** \\- _It is dancing. I am doing it. You want it. Everyone can do it.\"_\n\nNow, using **ka** , you can correctly phrase \"I can run on my arms\". How?\n\nAnswer: mi kakne lo ka {ce'u} bajra fi lo mi birka\n\nA lot of often-used gismu take selbri as one of their sumti, which means **lo\nka** is used quite often. A few notable examples are **troci** , **kakne** ,\n**djica** , **zukte** , **snada** and **fraxu** :\n\n**lo xasli na’e kakne lo ka silcu la'e la'oi X-files** \\- \"The donkey cannot\nwhistle the X-files song\"\n\n**.e'o ko lo jai se zgike cu fraxu lo ka darxi lo damri ca lo nu do sipna** \\-\n\"Please forgive the musician for striking the drum when you were sleeping!\"\n\nAt least one selbri can fill two **ce'u** within a ka-abstraction, namely\n‘’simxu’’. What does the following jufra mean?\n\n**mi lo pampe'o cu simxu lo ka {ce'u ce'u} gletu**\n\nAnswer: _Me and my lover have sex with each other mutually\"_\n\nOf course, the **ce'u** need not be placed in the beginning of the **ka**\n-abstraction, though it is by default. One could very well speak of:\n\n**lo ka la .bab. melbi ce'u** \\- \"The selbri of: \"Bob is beautiful according\nto X\"\", or in other words: \"Thinking that Bob is beautiful\".\n\nIndeed, moving the **ce'u** around in an function creates very different\nmeanings:\n\n**lo ka ce'u panzi la .maik.** \\- \"The selbri: \"X is a child of Mike\"\" =\n\"Being Mike's child\", versus\n\n**lo ka la .maik. panzi ce'u** \\- \"The selbri: \"Mike is a child of X\"\" =\n\"Being the parent of Mike\".\n\nOne could even imagine a statement in where the **ce'u** is placed in a very\nunconventional place, that nonetheless is quite intuitive:\n\n**mi .e nai do ckaji lo ka lo bruna cu jbocre** , wherein the **ce'u** is\nelided, but most probably hiding in **lo bruna be ce'u** , therefore meaning\n\"I and not you is characterized by the selbri: \"The brother of X is good at\nLojban\"\", which is the same as \"I have a brother who's good at Lojban, but you\ndon't\".\n\nOne can make a function, like a \"ka\"-abstraction, and fill all sumti places,\nleaving no place for a **ce'u**. The resulting bridi are weird:\n\n**mi kakne lo ka mi merko lo mi bangu** \\- \"I can my language is American\".\nThis is clearly a type error. Some people regard functions without any\n**ce'u** to be equivalent to bridi abstractions, so that:\n\n**mi krici lo ka mi vrude la cevni** is the same as **mi krici lo du'u mi\nvrude la cevni** \\- \"I believe that I am good in the eyes of God\", and is just\nas good a sentence in Lojban as its translation is in English. In my opinion,\none should refrain from using any of the function abstractors if one doesn't\nwant to use a function. If you mean **du'u** , use **du'u**.\n\nThe other abstractor which clearly can provide a function is **ni**. Like\n**ka** , a **ce'u** can be placed in a **ni** abstraction, but unlike with\n‘’ka’’, using a ‘’ce’u’’ with ‘’ni’’ is not mandatory. Thus, if no **ce'u** is\nplaced in a **ni** -abstraction, one cannot assume that it's elided - it might\nsimply not be there. If the main selbri is not one which clearly tells us how\nto fill a **ce'u** -place, such as **zmadu** or **mleca** , there's probably\nno **ce'u** at all.\n\nIn all other aspects, the way **ce'u** works within the abstraction is just\nlike **ka** , so the difference is purely semantical. Whereas **ka** creates a\nselbri, **ni** creates an amount. Here's the definition of the word:\n\n    **ni** = _Amount abstraction: x 1 is the amount of BRIDI on scale x2_\n\nBeing familiar with **ka** , the usage of **ni** should be straightforward:\n\n**mi zmadu do lo ni {ce'u} xekri** \\- \"I exceed you in amount: \"X is black\"\",\nor: \"I'm blacker than you.\" As stated in lesson twenty-eight, all agree that\nthis makes total sense because the brightness of one's skin could be measured\nby a camera. However, some people will not accept the unmeasurable:\n\n**mi zmadu do lo ni mi pendo la .maik.** \\- \"I am more of a friend of Mike\nthan you are\". I think using amounts to quantify the unmeasurable is fine, but\nthat is an issue I swept under the carpet two lessons ago, and I'm not gonna\ntake it on here.\n\nIt's absolutely clear, however, that it's wrong to use **ni** as a way to\nenumerate how many objects fit a selbri - it's always about to which extent\ncertain sumti fit a selbri. Thus:\n\n**do mleca mi lo ni panzi ce'u** means \"You are less of a parent than I am\",\nand not \"You have fewer children than me\".\n\nIn case you're curious (I was), the jufra **zo'e panzi ce'u** in the previous\nexample actually refers to two distinct bridi, because the selbri fills the\nopen **ce'u** -place twice, once for **do** , and once for **mi** , making the\ntwo sub-bridi: **zo'e panzi do** and **zo'e panzi mi**. Since these two bridi\nare considered different, the **zo'e** need not refer to the same object.\n\nWhat does it mean if you don't use a **ce'u** inside a **ni** -abstraction?\nWell, then the main selbri can't fill any of the sumti in the abstraction, so\nwhen using selbri like **zmadu** and **mleca** , there's a good chance it\nwon't make any sense. However, if **ni** itself is the main selbri, it's\ntotally fine to avoid using any **ce'u** at all:\n\n**li du'e ni do nelci lo vanju**  \n _You like wine too much._  \n---  \n  \nThe last of the abstractors we treat in this lesson is **si'o** , the concept\nabstractor. **si'o** may be considered a function, or it may not be considered\na function. A **si'o** -abstraction certainly contains a **ce'u** \\- in fact,\nunder the understanding which I am teaching, a **si'o** -abstraction always\ncontains nothing but **ce'u** s! These **ce'u** s, unlike those of **ka** or\n**ni** , remain open and cannot be filled by any selbri. In other words, the\nfunction cannot be applied to anything, which is what makes it a maybe-\nfunction.\n\n    **si'o** = _Concept abstractor: x 1 is x2's concept of BRIDI_\n\nLet's have a few examples:\n\n**lo si'o xebni** , which, because all the sumti places are filled with\n**ce'u** is equivalent to:\n\n**lo si'o ce'u xebni ce'u** \\- \"The concept of: \"X hates Y\"\" = \"The concept of\nhate\" = _Hate_\n\nThe mythical creatures Balrog from Lord of the Rings are described as being\n\"shadow and flame\", the poesy of which appears much stronger in Lojban: **la\nbalrog cu si'o fagri joi manku** is asserting not only that it’s made out of\nshadow and flame, but also suggesting that it’s the prototypical Shadow and\nFlame, from which all other shadow and flame derives.\n\nFor good measure, it should be stated that etymologically, \"si'o\" derives from\n\"sidbo\", \"idea\", but in current usage an idea is considered a text and not a\nconcept.\n\nThe difference between the three abstractors **ka** , **ni** and **si'o** can\nbe illustrated with a few more examples for comparison:\n\n**lo ka crino cu pluka mi**  \n _Being green pleases me_  \n---  \n**lo ni crino cu pluka mi**  \n _How much {zo'e} is green pleases me (no**ce'u**!)_  \n---  \n**lo si'o crino cu pluka mi**  \n _Greenness pleases me_  \n---  \n**mi nitcu lo ka sipna ku lo ka kanro**  \n _I need sleep in order to be healthy_  \n---  \n**mi nitcu lo si'o sipna lo ka tavla fi lo sipna**  \n _I need the concept of sleep in order to speak about sleeping things_  \n---  \n  \nAnd I was tempted to write **mi nitcu lo ni sipna ku lo ka vreji ri** \\- \"I\nneed the amount of how much {zo'e} sleeps\", but that doesn't seem to make a\nlot of sense.\n\n## Lesson 31: The not-so-cute assorted words\n\nYes, this lesson is yet another which focuses on assorted words. This time,\nhowever, the content of the lesson is not chosen by common usage: Unlike words\nlike **jai** and **si** , most of the following words see little usage in\nordinary conversation. Some of them are, however, important to understanding\nthe following lessons, and so these words must be awkwardly placed before\ntheir usage in these lessons.\n\nBefore we venture to obscure words, there's one word which I think deserves a\nmore thorough explanation than it has been given so far: **kau**.\n\n**kau** was explained in lesson twelve, but the real implications of it was\nnot. If you have forgotten what it means, I advice you to go back and see.\nUnfortunately, I can't present a theory on what **kau** does when it's present\nin the main bridi, only on what it does inside an abstraction.\n\nA bridi with abstraction containing a **kau** makes two claims: The bridi\nitself makes one claim as usual, and implicit in the abstraction is\nfurthermore the claim that the word **kau** is attached to has a real, nonzero\nmeaning.\n\nThis should be demonstrated: The bridi **mi pu viska lo nu ma kau cliva le\nsalci** (I saw who left the party) makes two claims. First, it makes an\nimplicit claim that the **ma** refers to something real. That is, the bridi\nactually claims that **da cliva le salci** (X left the party). Secondly, the\nmain bridi makes the claim that what the **ma** refers to is what was being\nseen, or in lojban **mi pu viska lo nu da cliva le salci**. (I saw that X left\nthe party)\n\nThis principle is not restricted to the abstractor **nu** , or to the question\nword **ma**. The same principle can be extended to any other abstractor and\nany other question word, as in the following bridi:\n\n**la .bab. na'e birti lo du'u xu kau la .mias. pampe'o** (Bob isn't sure\nwhether or not Mia has a boyfriend) states firstly that **xu** applies, which\nmeans that a truth value correctly can be assigned to the bridi, and secondly\nthat what Bob isn't sure about is the correct truth value for the bridi.\n\n**kau** can also be applied to a non-question word. This doesn't really change\nthe meaning of the word. The same procedure still applies:\n\n**do ca'o djuno lo du'u la krestcen kau cu cinba la an**  \n _You already know that it was Kristian, who kissed Anne._  \n---  \n  \nstates firstly that **la krestcen cu cinba la an** and then that **do ca'o\ndjuno lodu'u la krestcen cu cinba la an**.\n\nMoving on to the more obscure words, we can begin with **xi** ; it's easy.\n\n    **xi** = _Subscript. Converts any following number string to a subscript, which has the grammar of an attitudinal (ie. placable practically anywhere)._\n\nThere are few officially encouraged uses of **xi** , but precisely because the\nconstruct **xi** +number has the free grammar of an attitudinal, the possible\nuses of **xi** are almost endless. In general, it's used to enumerate any\nword, variable or grammatical construct, as opposed to what it refers to.\nLet's see some examples.\n\n**la tsani cu cusku zo coi .i ba bo la .triliyn. cu cusku lu .ui coi la tsani\ncoi la klaku li'u .i ba bo la klaku cu spusku fi lu coi ty. xi pa .e ty. xi re\ndo'u zo'o li'u**  \n _Tsani said \"hi\", then Triliyn said \"Hey Tsani, hey Klaku :)\", then Klaku\nanswered \"Hello T1 and T2 :P\"._  \n---  \n  \n    **spusku** = _x 1 makes a reply x2 (text) to x3_\n\nBecause it's the standard that **ty.** refers to the last sumti which began\nwith T, **ty** by itself as said by Klaku would have referred to Tsani. Two\n_different_ **ty.** can be made by subscripting with **xi**.\n\nIf the rare situation arises that we need more variables of the type **da** or\n**bu'a** that there are in the language, an infinite number can be made by\nsimply subscripting any existing with a number. Note that a non-subscripted\nvariable is not defined of being equivalent to any subscripted one. That is:\n**ty** is not always equal to **ty xi pa** or **ty xi no** or anything of the\nsort. I expect this to be rarely used, because any sentence with more than 3\n**da** -like words or more than 10 **ko'a** -like words would be hard to keep\ntrack of.\n\nSecond, we have **ki** , of which I am not aware of a single usage in my time\non IRC; probably not because the word's useless, but because few Lojbanic\ntexts are of the kind where you need it.\n\n    **ki** = _\"Sticky tense\". Set/use tense default; establishes new open scope space/time/modal reference base._\n\nAny row of tense words can be suffixed with **ki** to make the tense(s) apply\nto all following bridi. When, for instance, telling a story, this can be used\nto make explicit that the default time - the time as meant without any tense\nwords - is the time the story is placed in. Usually, this will not be\nnecessary; beginning a fairytale with **pu zu vu ku** , one can assume that\nthe entire tale is happening a long time ago and far away. Let's have an\nexample:\n\n**pu zu vu ki ku zasti fa lo pukclite je cmalu nixli goi ko'a .i ro da poi _pu\nzu vu_ viska ko'a cu nelci ko'a**  \n _Once upon a time there was a sweet, little girl. Everyone who saw her liked\nher._  \n---  \n  \nThe **ki** allows us to elide the three tenses in the second bridi, and in all\nthe bridi to follow.\n\nSo, if a bunch of tenses have been make sticky with **ki** , how do we unstick\nthem? Simply use **ki** by itself, and all sticky tenses are made unsticky.\n\nLastly, several sets of tenses can be made sticky by subscripting **ki**. If\nthere are several of such sets in usage at any given time, one can use the\nsubscripted **ki** s to make the corresponding set of tenses apply.\nUnsubscripted **ki** alone still makes all tense stickiness disappear, so you\nhave to be careful not to use **ki** unsubscripted if you plan on using\nseveral sets of tenses.\n\nChanging subject. There's a set of sumtcita which are often used, but which I\ndare not try to define if not under the disclaimer of part three. Let's see\nofficial definitions for two of them first.\n\n    **ca'a** = _modal aspect: actuality/ongoing event. Bridi has/is/will happen during under the circumstances of {sumti_}\n    **ka'e** = _modal aspect: innate capability; possibly unrealized. Bridi is possible under the circumstances of {sumti_}\n\nLet's first contrast **ca'a** with **ka'e**. **ka'e** means that the bridi is\n\"possible if the event of SUMTI has/is/will occur\". **ca'a** by contrast,\nmeans that the bridi \"has, is, or will happen if the event of SUMTI\nhas/is/will occur\".\n\nLike all sumtcita, their corresponding sumti can be elided if the sumtcita is\nplaced before the selbri:\n\n**le vi sovda ka'e fulta .i ja'o bo ri fusra** \\- \"This egg floats. Therefore,\nit's rotten\".\n\nBy using **ka'e** , this sentence does not state that the egg has floated, or\never will float, but rather that it could float.\n\n    **pu'i** = _modal aspect: can and has; demonstrated potential. Bridi could or could not happen, but in fact it is/did/will happen under the circumstance of {sumti}_\n    **nu'o** = _modal aspect: can but has not; unrealized potential. Bridi is possible, but is/will/have not happened under {sumti}_\n\nUnderstanding **ka'e** and **ca'a** , **nu'o** simply means **ka'e je na ku\nca'a** , and **pu'i** means **ca'a je ka'e na ku**.\n\nHistorically, these four words was tense sumtcita - therefore the \"modal\naspect\" in their definitions. All tense sumtcita was then not considered\nsumtcita at all, but rather \"selbri tcita\". A modern understanding of Lojban\nis gaining popularity, wherein the tense sumtcita are considered sumtcita,\nalmost exactly like the BAI, and in where selbri tcita are not used.\n\nBecause of these four words' history as selbri tcita, they can be freely\nelided - indeed, since one of the four words always applies, one is always\nassumed to be elided. This is most often **ca'a**. Indeed, it's so often\n**ca'a** that one could wonder why **ca'a** is not the default.\n\nOne reason is that some selbri has two useful definitions, one which implies\n**ka'e SELBRI** and one which implies **ca'a SELBRI**. For an example, see\n**fasnu** , which can mean \"x1 is happening\" or \"x1 is an event\", where the\nfirst implies **ca'a fasnu** and the second **ka'e fasnu**\n\nAnother use of \"implied **ka'e** \" is as a way to escape an annoying\nphilosophical problem in the language. A selbri only applies if all its places\napply too. For some selbri, like **kabri** , that's a problem.\n\n    **kabri** = _x 1 is a cup containing contents x2 and of material x3_\n\nThe definition suggests that if the content of the cup is removed, the x2 no\nlonger applies and it stops being **lo kabri**. Implied **ka'e** , or more\nfittingly, **nu'o** , let us escape that problem.\n\n## End of lessons\n\nSorry, but as of now, there are no more lessons in this series. Perhaps more\nwill be added later.\n\n  \n\nRetrieved from\n\"https://mw.lojban.org/index.php?title=Lojban_Wave_Lessons/Single_page&oldid=120977\"\n\n## Navigation\n\n### Navigation\n\n  * Learning\n  * Questions\n  * Live chat\n  * Contacts\n  * Recent changes\n\n## Wiki tools\n\n### Wiki tools\n\n  * Special pages\n\n## Page tools\n\n### Page tools\n\n### User page tools\n\n### More\n\n  * What links here\n  * Related changes\n  * Printable version\n  * Permanent link\n  * Page information\n  * Page logs\n\n  * \n\n  * This page was last edited on 27 June 2016, at 12:44.\n\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban_Wave_Lessons/Single_page", "title": "Lojban Wave Lessons/Single page - La Lojban", "language": "en"}}

Originally called\n'Loglan' by project founder Dr. James Cooke Brown, who started the language\ndevelopment in 1955, the goals for the language were first described in the\narticle _Loglan_ in _Scientific American_ , June 1960. Made well-known by that\narticle and by occasional references in science fiction and computer\npublications, Loglan/Lojban has been built over four decades by dozens of\nworkers and hundreds of supporters, led since 1987 by The Logical Language\nGroup.\n\nThere are many artificial languages, but Loglan/Lojban has been _engineered_\nto make it unique in several ways. The following are the main features of\nLojban:\n\n  * Lojban is designed to be used by people in communication with each other, and possibly in the future with computers.\n\n  * Lojban is designed to be culturally neutral.\n\n  * Lojban grammar is based on the principles of logic.\n\n  * Lojban has an unambiguous grammar.\n\n  * Lojban has phonetic spelling, and sounds can be divided into words in only one way.\n\n  * Lojban is simple compared to natural languages; it is easy to learn.\n\n  * Lojban's 1350 root words can be easily combined to form a vocabulary of millions of words.\n\n  * Lojban is regular; the rules of the language don't have exceptions.\n\n  * Lojban attempts to remove restrictions on creative and clear thought and communication.\n\n  * Lojban has a variety of uses, ranging from creative to scientific, from theoretical to practical.\n\nThe following sections examine each of these points, while answering the\nquestions most often asked about Lojban.\n\n* * *\n\n**2.** Why was Lojban developed?\n\n**** Lojban was originally designed to support research on a concept known as\nthe Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Simply expressed, this hypothesis states that the\nstructure of a language constrains the thinking of people using that language.\nLojban allows the full expressive capability of a natural language, but\ndiffers in structure from other languages in major ways. This allows it to be\nused as a test vehicle for scientists studying the relationships between\nlanguage, thought, and culture. If you are reading this as part of the\nintroductory booklet, further discussion of these issues can be found in the\nsection _Technical Descriptions_.\n\n* * *\n\n**3.** Are there other uses for Lojban?\n\n**** Yes, several. Due to its unambiguous grammar and simple structure, it\nalso can be easily parsed (broken down for analysis) by computers, making it\npossible for Lojban to be used in the future for computer-human interaction,\nand perhaps conversation. Lojban's structure is similar to existing artificial\nintelligence (AI) programming languages, and it may become be a most powerful\nadjunct to AI research, especially in the storing and processing of data about\nthe world and people's conceptions of it. There are also linguists interested\nin Lojban's potential as an intermediate language in computer-aided\ntranslation of natural languages; and Lojban is of interest as a potential\nstepping-stone for students learning other languages. Because Lojban was\ndesigned to be culturally neutral, and has a powerful vocabulary easily\nlearned by people of different language origins, some are interested in\nLojban's potential as an international language. These are only the beginnings\nof the Lojban applications that will be developed in the future.\n\n* * *\n\n**4.** Is Lojban a computer language?\n\n**** Lojban was designed as a _human language_ , and not as a computer\nlanguage. It is therefore intended for use in conversation, reading, writing,\nand thinking. However, since Lojban can be processed by a computer much more\neasily than can a natural language, it is only a matter of time before Lojban-\nbased computer applications are developed. Learning and using Lojban doesn't\nrequire you to know anything about computers or to talk like one.\n\n* * *\n\n**5.** How is Lojban written? How does it sound?\n\n**** Lojban uses letters of the Roman alphabet to represent its 6 vowels and\n17 consonants. The Lojban character set uses only standard typewriter/computer\nkeyboard keys; capitalization is used rarely, and only to indicate unusual\nstress in the pronunciation of names. Punctuation is spoken as words. The\nwritten language corresponds exactly to the sounds of the spoken language;\nspelling is phonetic and unambiguous, and the flowing sounds of the language\nbreak down into words in only one possible way. These features make computer\nspeech recognition and transcription more practical. Learning to pronounce and\nspell Lojban is trivial.\n\nLojban has a smooth, rhythmic sound, somewhat like Italian. However, its\nconsonants create a fullness and power found in Slavic languages like Russian,\nand the large number of vowel pairs impart a hint of Chinese, Polynesian, and\nother Oriental languages, though without the tones that make many of those\nlanguages difficult for others to learn.\n\nBecause there are no idioms to shorten expressions, a Lojban text can be\nlonger than the corresponding colloquial English text. The unambiguous\nlinguistic structures that result are a major benefit that makes this\nworthwhile; and Lojban has constructions of its own that are rather more\nsuccinct than their equivalents in English (such as logic-specific\nformulations, and expressions of attitude.) Moreover, much of the\ndisambiguating machinery of Lojban is optional; you use them only when you\n_need_ to use them.\n\nAs an example of Lojban, Occam's Razor (\"The simplest explanation is usually\nthe best\") may be translated as:\n\n> `roda poi velcki cu so'eroi ke ganai saprai gi xagrai`  \n>  /row-dah poy VELSH-kee shoo so-heh-roy keh GAH-nye SAHP-rye ghee KHAH-grye/  \n>  _All somethings which-are explanations mostly-are (if superlatively-simple\n> then superlatively-good)._\n\nThe apostrophe is pronounced like a short, breathy 'h', and is used to clearly\nseparate the two adjacent vowels for a listener, without requiring a pause\nbetween them.\n\n(If you are reading this text in the _What is Lojban?_ booklet, a full\npronunciation key is available in the _Overview of Lojban Grammar_.)\n\n* * *\n\n**6.** What kind of grammar does Lojban have?\n\n**** 'Grammar' is a word with painful memories for many of us. But though\nLojban grammar seems strange at first sight, it is actually quite simple. It\nis based on a system called predicate logic, which states that in any sentence\nyou have a **relationship** (`_selbri_` in Lojban) between one or more\n**arguments** (`_sumti_`). An argument can be a thing, event, quality or just\nabout anything. To give an example, the English sentence\n\n> _Chris adores Pat_  \n\nhas a relation _adore_ , between two arguments, _Chris_ and _Pat_. In Lojban\nthis would be\n\n> `la kris. prami la pat.`\n\nor, if you prefer,\n\n> `la kris. la pat. prami`\n\n(The full stops mean that you have to pause slightly to separate the words --\nanythingelseinLojbancanberuntogetherwithoutbeingmisunderstood).\n\nYou might be thinking \"Well in that case a relationship is a verb and an\nargument is a noun, so why bother with special terminology like `_selbri_` and\nwhatnot?\" However, in Lojban Chris's feelings about Pat might be described\nlike this:\n\n> `la pat. melbi`  \n>  Pat is beautiful.\n\nIn English you have a verb ('doing word'), _is_ , and an adjective\n('describing word'), _beautiful_. In Turkish, you would say _Pat g�zel_ ,\nwhich is a noun and an adjective, with no verb required. In Chinese you would\nuse _meili_ , a 'stative verb' \\-- but enough! In Lojban you don't need all\nthese language-specific notions.\n\nNow, if there are no nouns, verbs, subjects or objects in Lojban, how do we\nknow that `la kris. la pat. prami` means that Chris adores Pat and not the\nother way? Different languages handle this problem differently. In English it\nis done with word order, and when that isn't enough, with prepositions (words\nlike _at_ , _from_ , _to_ , _with_ and so on). In other languages, like Latin\nor Turkish, it's done by changing the form of the words, e.g. _Pat'i Chris\nsever_ in Turkish means \"Chris loves Pat\", not \"Pat loves Chris.\"\n\nIn Lojban, the order in which arguments appear is built in to the meaning of\nthe word. For example, the word `dunda` means _give_ , but its full meaning\nis:\n\n> x1 gives x2 to x3\n\nSo `mi pu dunda le cukta le ninmu` means \"I gave the book to the woman\", not\n\"I gave the woman to the book\").\n\nThe important point is that Lojban has a lot of what we would call 'grammar',\nbut nearly all of this is contained in the `_cmavo_` (structure words), and\nyou can use as many or as few of them as you want.\n\n* * *\n\n**7.** What else is distinctive about Lojban grammar?\n\n**** In Lojban, it is equally easy to speak of something as being an action as\nit is to speak of it as being a state of existence. The distinction between\nthe two can be ignored, or can be explicitly expressed in a variety of ways:\n\n  * by associating concepts in `_tanru_` metaphors (combinations of `_selbri_` into single expressions giving novel meanings), involving words like `gasnu` ('do'), `zasti` ('exist'), `zukte` ('act with purpose');\n\n  * with a variety of 'operators' (`_cmavo_`) dealing with abstractions such as events, states, properties, amounts, ideas, experience, and truth;\n\n  * or with four pre-defined varieties of causality (others can be developed through `_tanru_` metaphor).\n\nA major benefit of using a predicate grammar is that Lojban doesn't have\ninflections and declensions on nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Most natural\nlanguages have evolved such variations to reduce ambiguity as to how words are\nrelated in a sentence. Language change has made these inflections and\ndeclensions highly irregular and thus difficult to learn. Lojban uses the\nsimple but flexible predicate relationship to erase both the irregularity and\nthe declensions.\n\nTense and location markers (inflections), adverbs, and prepositions are\ncombined into one part of speech. New preposition-like forms can be built at\nwill from predicates; these allow the user to expand upon a sentence by\nattaching and relating arguments not normally included in the meaning of a\nword.\n\nNumbers and quantifiers are conceptually expanded from natural languages.\n_Many_ , _enough_ , _too much_ , _a few_ , and _at least_ are among concepts\nthat are expressed as numbers in Lojban. Thus \"it costs $3.95\" and \"it costs\ntoo much\" are grammatically identical, and one can talk of being \"enough-th in\nline\" for tickets to a sellout movie. Core concepts of logic, mathematics, and\nscience are built into the root vocabulary. They enhance discussion of those\ntopics, and are surprisingly useful in ordinary speech, too.\n\nPredicate logic can express a wide variety of human thought; Lojban also has\nnon-logical constructs that do not affect or obscure the logical structure,\nallowing communications that are not amenable to logical analysis. For\nexample, Lojban has a full set of emotional indicators, which are similar to\nsuch interjections in English as _Oh!_ , _Aha!_ , and _Wheee!_ , but each has\na specific meaning. Similarly, Lojban has indicators of the speaker's\nrelationship to what is said (whether it is hearsay, direct observation,\nlogical deduction, etc.) similar to those found in some Native American\nlanguages.\n\nLojban supports metalinguistic discussion about the sentences being spoken\nwhile remaining unambiguous. Lojban also supports a variety of 'tense' logic\nthat allows one to be extremely specific about time and space (and space-time)\nrelationships. A substantial portion of Lojban's grammar is designed to\nsupport unambiguous statement of mathematical expressions and relations in a\nmanner compatible both with international usage and the rest of Lojban's\ngrammar.\n\nLojban 'parts of speech' are convertible from one to another by using short\nstructure words (called `_cmavo_`). One can make numbers serve as nouns or\nverbs, or invent new numbers and prepositions. Lojban removes many of the\nconstraints on human thought, while preserving tight control on structural\nsyntax.\n\n* * *\n\n**8.** Lojban seems complex. How hard is it to learn?\n\n**** Lojban is actually much simpler than natural languages. It is only\nslightly more complex in its grammar than the current generation of computer\nlanguages (such as C++ and Perl). Lojban seems complex only because the\nvarieties of human thought are complex, and Lojban is designed to minimize\nconstraints on those thoughts. Lojban text can appear longer and more complex\ndue to its lack of idiom, its complete explicitness of logical structure, and\nmost importantly, its unfamiliarity. On the other hand, conversational speech\nuses less than half of the possible grammatical structures, leaving the rest\nfor writing and for other circumstances when one is likely to take time to\ncarefully formulate exact logical phrasings.\n\nLojban's pronunciation, spelling, word formation, and grammar rules are fixed,\nand the language is free of exceptions to these rules. Such exceptions are the\nbane of learning to speak a natural language _correctly_. Without the burden\nof ambiguity, Lojban users can be precise and specific more easily than in\nother languages.\n\nBecause Lojban's grammar is simple, it is easier to learn than other\nlanguages. Using flashcard-like techniques, a working vocabulary including the\ncomplete set of 1350 root words can take 8-12 weeks of study at 1 hour per\nday. It is by no means uncommon for people who embark on learning Lojban to be\nable to write grammatical Lojban within a few days, and to hold at least a\nlimited conversation within a few weeks. Natural languages, especially\nEnglish, take several years to learn to a comparable level of skill.\n\nThe available Lojban teaching materials are so structured that you can learn\nthe language without classroom instruction or a close community of speakers.\nCommunication practice with others is needed to achieve fluency, but you can\nstart using the language as you achieve proficiency.\n\n* * *\n\n**9.** What do you mean by 'unambiguous'?\n\n****Lojban has an unambiguous grammar (proven by computer analysis of a formal\ngrammar), pronunciation, and **morphology** (word forms). In practice this\nmeans that the person who reads or hears a Lojban sentence is never in doubt\nas to what words it contains or what roles they play in the sentence. This is\ntrue even if the words are unfamiliar, so long as the spelling and grammar\nrules are known. Lojban has no words that sound alike but have different\nmeanings (like _herd_ and _heard_), that have multiple unrelated meanings\n(_set_), or that differ only in punctuation but not in sound (like the\nabominable _its_ and _it's_). There is never any doubt about where words begin\nand end (if you hear _cargo ship_ , do you hear two words or three?) Most\nimportant, the function of each word is inescapably clear; there is nothing\nlike the English sentence _Time flies like an arrow_ , in which any of the\nfirst three words could be the verb.\n\nLojban is _not_ entirely unambiguous, of course; human beings occasionally\ndesire to be ambiguous in their expressions. In Lojban, this ambiguity is\nlimited to semantics, `_tanru_` metaphor, and intentional omission of\ninformation (ellipsis).\n\nSemantic ambiguity results because words in natural languages represent\nfamilies of concepts rather than individual meanings. These meanings often\nhave only weak semantic relationships to each other (the English word _run_ is\na good example.) In addition, each individual's personal experiences provide\nemotional connotations to words. By providing a fresh, culturally-neutral\nstart, Lojban attempts to minimize the transference of these associations as\npeople learn the language. Most Lojban words do not much resemble\ncorresponding words in other languages; the differences aid in making this\nfresh start possible.\n\nLojban's powerful `_tanru_` (combinations of `_selbri_` into novel concepts)\nand word-building features make it easy to make fine distinctions between\nconcepts. This discourages the tendency for individual words to acquire\nfamilies of meanings. Lojban's `_tanru_` metaphors are themselves ambiguous;\nthey specify a relationship between concepts, but not what the relationship\nis. That relationship can be made explicit using unambiguous logical\nconstructs if necessary, or can be left vague, as the speaker typically\ndesires. Similarly, portions of the logical structure of a Lojban expression\ncan be omitted, greatly simplifying the expression while causing some\nambiguity. Unlike in the natural languages, though, this ambiguity is readily\nidentified by a reader or listener. Thus all ambiguity in Lojban is\nconstrained and recognizable, and can be clarified as necessary by further\ninteraction.\n\nThis precision in no way confines the meaning of a Lojban sentence. It is\npossible to be fanciful or ridiculous, to tell lies, or to be misunderstood.\nYou can be very specific, or you can be intentionally vague. Your hearer may\nnot understand what you _meant_ , but will always understand what you _said_.\n\n* * *\n\n**10.** Can you make jokes in an unambiguous language?\n\n****Most humor arises from situation and character and is as funny in Lojban\nas in any language. Humor based on word play, of course, is language-\ndependent. Lojban has no homonyms, and hence no simple puns; puns derived from\nsimilar sounds are still possible, and have in fact been attempted (for\nexample in the Lojban translation of _Alice in Wonderland_). Since Lojban will\nalmost always be a second language, bilingual puns and word play abound, often\nbased on the relative ambiguity of the other languages involved. Humor based\non internal grammatical ambiguity is of course impossible in Lojban, but humor\nbased on nonsensical statements, or on logical structures that would be\ndifficult to clearly express in another language, becomes easier.\n\nAs speakers become fluent, and conventional phrases come into use, Lojban will\ndevelop its own forms of spoonerisms and subtle puns. Unique forms of Lojban\nword-play have already turned up; they exploit the way small variations in\nLojban grammar create unexpected variations in meaning, and the capability to\nsimply express rather mind-boggling relationships. Like all word-play, these\nlose zest when translated into other languages.\n\nRelated to humor is the aphorism: the pithy saying that gains pungency or\npoignancy from terse, elegant phrasing. Lojban seems as capable of aphorisms\nas any language, perhaps more than most; however, because the language is so\nyoung, few such aphorisms have been devised to date.\n\n* * *\n\n**11.** Isn't Esperanto the 'international language'?\n\n****There have been hundreds of artificial international languages developed,\nof which Esperanto is the most successful and widely known. Esperanto, like\nmost other such languages, was based on European languages in both grammar and\nvocabulary. Although it manages to be relatively neutral between them, it\nstill retains an inherent cultural bias which makes it unsuited for most of\nthe purposes that Lojban was designed for.\n\nLojban is culturally fully neutral. Its vocabulary was built algorithmically\nusing today's six most widely spoken languages: Chinese, Hindi, English,\nRussian, Spanish, and Arabic. Lojban's words thus show roots in three major\nfamilies of languages spoken by most of the world's people. Lojban's grammar\naccommodates structures found in non-European languages, and uses sounds found\nin many of the world's languages. Coupled with the potential computer\napplications that will make Lojban a useful language to know, Lojban's\npotential as an international language may be more far-reaching than\nEsperanto's.\n\nLojban was not designed primarily to be an international language, however,\nbut rather as a linguistic tool for studying and understanding language. Its\nlinguistic and computer applications make Lojban unique among proposed\ninternational languages: Lojban can be successful without immediately being\naccepted and adopted everywhere, and Lojban can be useful and interesting even\nto those skeptical of or hostile towards the international language movement.\n\nSince Lojban is also not in direct competition with Esperanto, it has proven\nattractive to Esperantists interested in acquiring a new perspective on their\nown international language, and who feel less threatened because Lojban has\ndifferent goals. Lojban's supporters recognize that it will take decades for\nLojban to acquire both the number and variety of speakers and the extensive\nhistory of usage that marks Esperanto culture. Meanwhile, each language\ncommunity has much to learn from the other; this process is already well\nunderway.\n\n* * *\n\n**12.** How about English as an international language?\n\n**** English is commonly used as an 'international language' in the fields of\nscience and technology, and is probably the most widely spoken language in the\nworld. American dominance of technology in the twentieth century has caused\nmassive borrowing from English into other languages that do not have words for\nall these new concepts. This dominance, and a heritage of colonialism and\nimperialism that has built resentment towards American and European\nimpositions on native cultures, has caused recent movements in other countries\n_away_ from English. The rising influence of other non-English-speaking\ncountries on world economics, science, and technology makes further declines\nin the universality of English likely.\n\nIn addition, many who know English as a second language speak it only\nminimally, though they may be able to read or understand many words. India is\na prominent example of a country where English is the only language more or\nless understood throughout the country, which has about 1500 languages and\ndialects; but the English spoken in India is often unintelligible to Americans\nor Britons. In fact, English is one of the most difficult languages to learn\nto use well. In countries where English is spoken along with other languages,\nit has been adapted into dialects which match the local culture and borrow\nwords from the other local languages. Some of these dialects are as much as\n70% unintelligible to American or British speakers, or to each other. As such,\nthere is no single English language to call an 'international' one.\n\nLojban is a single language, with design features to discourage breaking up\ninto separate languages. While it was developed primarily by Americans, and\nwas designed to be at least as expressive as English is, Lojban's cultural\nneutrality gives equal priority to the structures and concepts of other\nlanguages and cultures. This cultural neutrality enhances Lojban's\nacceptability as an international language. Since it is as capable as English\nis of generating or borrowing any words needed to support the concepts of\nscience and technology, and has special advantages for computer applications,\nLojban is likely to spread worldwide through the technological community. Far\nmore so than English, Lojban is simple and easy to learn for people of all\ncultures.\n\n* * *\n\n**13.** Can poetry be written in a 'logical' language or an 'unambiguous' one?\n\n**** Original poetry has already been written in Lojban, and some has been\ntranslated into the language. Lojban's powerful `_tanru_` metaphor structure\nallows you to build concepts into words easily, as you need them, and has been\nused to create colorful images and to convey moving emotions. A Lojban speaker\ndoesn't need a dictionary to use and understand millions of words that can\npotentially exist in the language. The absence of cultural constraints makes\nconsideration of new ideas and relationships easier than in natural languages,\nspurring creativity. Lojban aids in communicating abstractions by identifying\ntheir nature explicitly. Lojban is thus a very powerful language, not only for\npoetry, but for discussing such abstract fields as philosophy, physics,\nmetaphysics, and religion.\n\nLojban poets are already experimenting with new (and old) forms of poetry that\nseem especially well suited to the rhythm, sound, and flow of the language.\nRarely do poets have such an opportunity to affect the development of a new\nlanguage as they now can with Lojban. Lojban's rich and powerful. Lojban\nunleashes the full potential of poetic expression to communicate both concrete\nand abstract ideas.\n\n* * *\n\n**14.** How was Lojban developed?\n\n**** The language, then called 'Loglan', was first described in the 1950s by\nDr. James Cooke Brown. The 1960 Scientific American article _Loglan_ was his\ncall for assistance in developing the language. A revolution in linguistics\nwas simultaneously taking place, resulting in a rapidly increasing knowledge\nof the nature of human language; this changed the requirements for the\ndeveloping language. The first widely distributed Loglan dictionary and\nlanguage description did not appear until 1975; the incompleteness of this\ndescription and continued development work discouraged people from learning\nthe language. Furthermore, computers caught up with Loglan just then, making\nit possible to refine the grammar, eliminate ambiguity and mathematically\nprove its absence. For over forty years, this work has been performed by\nvolunteers, and without financial support. Now, after several versions of the\nlanguage, people have been learning and using the current version, which is\nthe first to be called 'Lojban' (from the roots \"logical-language\" in Lojban).\n\nThis version is the first version with a stable vocabulary, and the first to\nhave a stable and completely defined grammar. The stabilization of the\nlanguage in this version has followed a painstaking and extensive period of\nresearch and analysis, between 1988 and 1998. Thus, in an important sense,\nLojban is a very new language. To ensure Lojban remains stable while people\nlearn it, the language definition is being closely controlled; the grammar and\ncore vocabulary have already been baselined (frozen) for several years. When\nthe number of speakers has grown significantly, and a Lojban literature has\ndeveloped, Lojban will be treated like a natural language and allowed to grow\nand flourish without constraint, as do other natural languages.\n\n* * *\n\n**15.** How many people speak Lojban?\n\n****Questions of how many people speak a language greatly depend on your\npresuppositions and definitions -- which a language like Lojban, at least, can\nmake explicit! The on-line Lojban mailing list, which constitutes the largest\ncommunity of people using the language, has over 200 subscribers, with well\nover 20 regular posters as of this writing. The level of confidence of the\nlanguage community has already risen to such a level that there is a Lojban-\nlanguage-only discussion group, as well as the general mailing list. Lojban\nhas also been used extensively in real-time conversation, both electronically\n(IRC) and face-to-face. Though the Lojban-speaking community is so widely\ndiffused that the opportunity for conversation does not arise frequently, the\nnumber of Lojbanists who can sustain a conversation in the language certainly\nranges beyond what can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and is steadily\nincreasing. Lojban has been proven in communicative use for well over a\ndecade, and the range and expressivity of the language is being continually\nexplored by the language community.\n\nThe first speakers of Lojban have a unique opportunity. They are the history-\nmakers who will shape the flavor of the first totally new language to achieve\nbroad speakability. Their ideas will be most influential in setting the\npatterns of usage that others will learn from. Their experiences will teach\nthings about language that have never before been learned -- or learnable.\n\n* * *\n\n**16.** Why should I learn Lojban?\n\n**** There are several reasons for learning the language now. Those who are\nworking with the language now are actively consulted for their opinions on how\nto teach and spread the language. Within a few weeks of work learning from the\nmaterials already written, you will be able to work with those who have\nalready started. You will be a significant part of this small but rapidly\ngrowing community. You will receive personal attention to any problems you\nhave with the language from those leading the effort. If you are truly\nambitious and committed to the language, you are welcome to join in that\nleadership.\n\nThose with a computer background who learn the language now will be the\nleaders in developing the earliest practical computer applications for the\nlanguage. Meanwhile, computer-oriented Lojbanists can also aid in developing\ncomputer-aided instruction tools or converting existing software to run on new\ncomputers.\n\nPeople not interested in computers will also find Lojban a valuable language.\nYou may be interested in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and in the scientific\ntests to be planned and conducted, or in other language-related research. You\nmay be interested in Lojban's potential as an international language, and in\nthe attempts to use the language to reach across cultural boundaries.\n\nRegardless of your background, you will find learning Lojban to be a mind-\nexpanding experience. Learning any language other than your native tongue\nbroadens your perspectives and allows you to transcend the necessarily limited\nviewpoints of your native language's culture. Lojban, being simpler to learn\nthan natural languages, provides this benefit much more quickly than does the\nstudy of other languages. And being quite different from natural languages,\nLojban provides this benefit more directly.\n\nHaving learned Lojban, you will find it easier to learn other languages and to\ncommunicate with people from other backgrounds, regardless of the language\nstudied; the linguistic principles you learn while learning Lojban are\napplicable to these languages and the communication problems they entail. The\nlogical organization embedded in Lojban will aid you in organizing and\nclarifying your thoughts. Your new perspective on language, ambiguity, and\ncommunication will allow you to express those thoughts more clearly, even when\nyou use an ambiguous natural language.\n\nYou needn't learn Lojban for any practical purpose, however. Many, if not\nmost, of those who are learning Lojban are doing so because it is fun.\nLearning Lojban is intellectually stimulating, providing human interaction (a\nway to meet other people and get to know them) and mental challenge. Lojban\nhas all the benefits of games designed for entertainment, with the side\nbenefit of that entertainment developing into a useful skill.\n\nLearning Lojban as an intellectual toy means that you can get enjoyment from\nlearning Lojban without anywhere near the effort needed to benefit from\nstudying other languages. While becoming fluent in Lojban will probably take\nhundreds of hours over several months, you can feel some sense of\naccomplishment in the language after just a couple of hours of study. You can\nuse Lojban immediately for fun, while gaining skill with greater experience.\n\n* * *\n\n**17.** How do I learn Lojban?\n\n**** This text appears in a booklet including a description of the grammar of\nLojban and some introductory learning materials. If you are reading this text\nin a separately printed brochure, you may write to the Logical Language Group\nat the address found at the end of this brochure, and we will be happy to\nprovide the complete booklet. We request a contribution of $5 to cover its\ncost.\n\nIf you are reading this brochure on-line, or have access to the Internet, the\ncomplete _What is Lojban?_ booklet is also available on the World Wide Web for\nfree at the address:\n\n> `http://www.lojban.org/publications/level0.html`\n\nOnce you have read this booklet, there are several directions you may proceed,\ndepending on your goals for use of the language.\n\nMost people learning the language will work for some time on their own before\nworking with others. We recommend, where possible, that you identify at least\none other person to study and interact with, either in person or by mail. The\nLogical Language Group maintains lists of Lojban students of various degrees\nof skill and activity levels. There is also both a general and an in-Lojban\ndiscussion group available on the Internet. Information will be found at the\nend of this document.\n\nAlmost any use you wish to make of Lojban requires some degree of mastery of\nthe basic vocabulary. You can learn enough Lojban grammar to support\nconversation in just a couple of hours, but you will need vocabulary in order\nto use that grammar.\n\nYou can learn the Lojban vocabulary using computer software. The Logical\nLanguage Group has computer-aided-teaching programs distributed under the name\n_LogFlash_, with MS-DOS/Windows, Macintosh and Unix versions currently\navailable. The software is based on flash-card teaching techniques, which are\nextremely efficient in helping you learn the vocabulary. Other computer\nsoftware is available, including a parser and a glosser.\n\nYou can learn the Lojban grammar in several ways, including by studying the\nexamples in our on-line text archives and mailing lists, and by going through\nthe formal grammar description. (The formal grammars are available in two\nformats, _YACC_ and simplified _E-BNF_.)\n\nAn introduction to the grammar of Lojban will be found in _Technical\nDescriptions_ in the _What is Lojban?_ booklet. There is also a set of\nintroductory lessons available (these cover the basics of the language, but at\na more leisurely pace): _Lojban for Beginners_ , by Robin Turner and Nick\nNicholas. A complete grammatical description of Lojban, _The Complete Lojban\nLanguage_ by John W. Cowan, was published by the Logical Language Group in\n1997. This is an authoritative reference, and can be used as an aid to\nlearning the advanced features of the language.\n\nA formal Lojban dictionary is being compiled, and will encompass the word\nlists already available from the Logical Language Group as of this writing.\nDraft versions of the dictionary are available on the Lojban web site (see\ncontact details below).\n\nOf course the only way to really learn a language is to _use_ it. The Logical\nLanguage Group will assist you in finding other Lojban students of comparable\nskill level and interests, either in your local area or reachable by post or\nelectronic mail. The on-line Lojban discussion groups regularly contain Lojban\ntext, some with detailed translations and some without translation, as well as\ndiscussions of language points by various members of the Lojban community.\nThere is also a discussion group specifically for beginners as of this\nwriting. Of course the best way to use the language is to recruit friends and\nassociates into studying and using the language with you. Even if they are not\ninterested in the same language goals as you are, the 'hobbyist' aspect of the\nlanguage will provide interesting and stimulating entertainment for all\nconcerned.\n\n* * *\n\n**18.** What is The Logical Language Group?\n\n****The Logical Language Group, Inc. is a non-profit organization, the\nembodiment of the Loglan/Lojban community. We were founded to complete the\nlanguage development process, to develop and publish teaching materials, to\norganize and teach the community, to promote applications of Lojban, and to\ninitiate and lead research efforts in linguistics, language education, and\nother areas related to Lojban. Simply put, our purpose is to serve you in all\nmanner of things Lojbanic. The Logical Language Group is not affiliated with\nThe Loglan Institute, Inc., the organization founded by James Cooke Brown.\n\nThe Logical Language Group is also called `la lojbangirz.` (_/lah lozh-BAHN-\ngeerz./_), its Lojban name. It was founded informally in 1987, and\nincorporated in 1988. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service approved our status as\na non-profit educational/scientific charity in 1989, making donations and\ngrants to the organization deductible under U.S. tax law.\n\nLoglan/Lojban has been developed almost totally by volunteer labor and small\ndonations of money. Lojban attracts people who are willing to devote a lot of\ntime and effort to seeing their dreams become reality. Thus, our only income\nhas been money derived from sales of our publications, and donations from\ninterested supporters.\n\nThe Logical Language Group publishes and sells printed materials on Lojban.\nAll language definition information is considered in the public domain, and\nmost Logical Language Group publications are distributed under a policy which\nallows not-for-charge copying and redistribution. Computer versions of many of\nour publications are available on-line at no charge. We ask people who receive\nour materials by any of these means to let us know, so that we may better\nserve you, and donate liberally, so that we may continue to serve you.\n\nMost materials that we sell require either prior payment, an informal\ncommitment to pay on your part, or your statement that you cannot afford to\npay for materials (in which case our supplying these materials is at our\ndiscretion). We attempt to flexibly support Lojbanists who have financial\nconstraints, and will accept reasonable offers of reduced or delayed payments\nsubject to our financial condition, given your commitment to actively maintain\ncontact and involvement with the community. Obviously, the level of your prior\nand current activity and any commitments you make to learning the language, or\nto volunteer work for `la lojbangirz.`, will be factored into our decision.\n\n`la lojbangirz.` has a special commitment to support Lojbanists outside the\nU.S., because so many of the language goals are dependent on building an\ninternational community of speakers, and because we recognize the difficulties\ncaused by the international currency market and the relative wealth of\nnations. We can accept bank cheques in most currencies and international\npayment via PayPal. We also encourage people to form groups so that they can\nreceive a single copy of our materials, copying or passing them to others to\nkeep the per-person costs low. We expect a lower standard of contact and\ncontribution from overseas Lojbanists when deciding whether to continue\nsending our materials at reduced or no charge.\n\nWe ask all recipients of our materials to help us financially in any way you\ncan. The Logical Language Group needs your gifts for support of the\nLoglan/Lojban project. Artificial languages are historically not self-\nsustaining financially, and have difficulty receiving outside support. The\nLogical Language Group, Inc. is prohibited by its bylaws from spending more\nthan 15% of its expenses for administrative purposes, except by special\nagreement with a donor who agrees to cover such added costs in full.\n\n* * *\n\n**19.** How does The Logical Language Group serve the community?\n\n**** The Logical Language Group coordinates and promotes activities involving\nLojban and the Lojban community. In that role, it publishes materials enabling\npeople to learn the language, and facilitates their forming a community of\nspeakers. Most people involved with Lojban stay informed by checking our web\npage or participating in the Lojban mailing lists (see contact details below).\nThe Logical Language Group also publishes newsletters and journals, including\nboth general news, aimed at those not actively involved in learning and using\nthe language, and more specific material, including discussions of features of\nthe language, debates on research issues and applications, letters from the\ncommunity and responses, and Lojban writings and translations.\n\nOur printed publications are free of advertisements (other than our own\nordering information, and occasional mention of individuals and organizations\nwho have contributed particular service to our efforts); and we do not sell\nour mailing list. Our publications are distributed as cheaply as possible to\nencourage new people to participate. In the interest of attracting the widest\naudience possible, we are committed to distributing as much material as\npossible using the 'open source' concept for computer software and a similar\npolicy for printed publications. This policy retains our copyrights but allows\nyou, with relatively few restrictions, to copy our materials for your friends.\n\nCertain materials that we publish contain information that we place in the\npublic domain. **All language definition information is considered to be\npublic.**\n\nIf you are attempting to learn the language, we will provide as much help as\nwe can to assist you. We will put you in touch with Lojbanists who might be\ninterested in studying or communicating with you in the language. You can also\nsend your writings to us for review, or for indirect exchange with others. We\ntry to foster research and social interaction among those who are learning, or\nwho have already learned the language. We aid such people in organizing,\nleading, and teaching formal classes and study groups, and will sponsor\naffiliated groups in local areas where non-profit sponsorship can be of\nbenefit. We conduct an annual celebration of the language and community (July\nor August), called 'Logfest', in conjunction with our annual business meeting\nin the Washington DC area. We also expect to support other local meetings and\ngatherings as the community grows.\n\nOf course, we also try to publicize the language. Our representatives can\nattend meetings to give presentations on the language. We distribute\ninformational material, including these booklets. Through our efforts, and\nwith your help, the community of Lojbanists is rapidly growing.\n\n* * *\n\n**20.** What can I do now?\n\n**** You can become involved in the Lojban project in a variety of ways,\ndepending on your background and interests, and on your available time:\n\n  * you can participate in completing the language documentation;\n\n  * you can devise applications for Lojban in computers, education, linguistics, and other fields;\n\n  * you can help in organizing Lojbanists in your area, and in recruiting new Lojbanists;\n\n  * you can help in teaching the language to new people (even while learning yourself);\n\n  * you can assist in spreading Lojban to non-English-speaking cultures by helping translate materials into other languages, and by identifying, recruiting, and communicating with contacts in other countries (international involvement is vital to ensuring that Lojban remains culturally neutral);\n\n  * you can contribute financially to support our organization, its activities, and its publications;\n\n  * you can use Lojban in composition, translation, and conversation with other Lojbanists.\n\nFor many of these activities, you need to learn the language first. However,\neven those who haven't yet had time to learn the language can assist in\nrecruiting and contributing ideas to the effort.\n\nHelping to publicize the language, of course, does not take a lot of time, or\nnecessarily even knowing the language. Talk to friends, relatives and\ncolleagues. We will gladly provide copies of this brochure on request. Lojban\ntends to sell itself; people who learn of it are more often than not intrigued\nby it.\n\nKeep in touch with us. We want to know your ideas and opinions on the\nlanguage, on our various activities, and on our products. We welcome open\ndebate on the language, and have even printed and made available writings that\nare critical of various aspects of our efforts, when they are of sufficient\ngeneral interest. Open debate aids in understanding and improves the overall\nquality of the language and of our presentation of it to the world. Much of\nthe language design is now complete, and the Logical Language Group is\ncommitted to maintaining a stable version of the language. Nonetheless, we\nwould rather hear criticism now within our community and either correct our\nproblems or prepare an adequate response, than do so later when such issues\nare raised by outsiders.\n\nIn short, Lojban is a product of _all_ of the community, including _you_ \\--\nif you choose.\n\nOf course, the most important thing you can do is:\n\n> **Use Lojban!:** Lojban will not really achieve the status of 'language'\n> until people _use_ it. We need creative people to write Lojban prose,\n> poetry, and dialog. We need translations made from fiction, technical\n> literature, from religious and philosophical writings, and from music.\n> _Only_ in this way will Lojban be proven practical, and gain the credibility\n> it needs to succeed.\n\n* * *\n\n**21.** Who do I contact?\n\n**** We have several volunteers who serve to coordinate Lojban activities in\nspecific regions of the world. There is also a limited amount of Lojban\nmaterials translated into languages other than English. This support is\nconstantly being added to; please contact us for details.\n\nThe Logical Language Group's website, which contains all its publicly\navailable information, is at:\n\n> `http://www.lojban.org`\n\nSeveral active Lojban-related mailing lists are available on the Internet. The\ngeneral Lojban list is `lojban`; the list for discussions in Lojban only is\n`jbosnu`; and the list specifically for beginners is `lojban-beginners`. They\nmay be accessed as follows:\n\nWeb|  | \n\n  * `http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lojban`\n  * `http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jbosnu`\n  * `http://www.lojban.org/lsg2/` (lojban-beginners)\n\n  \n---|---|---  \nEmail|  | \n\n  * `[email protected]`\n  * `[email protected]`\n  * `[email protected]`\n\n  \nSubscribe|  | `http://www.lojban.org/lsg2/` for all lists.  \n  \n(All lists are mirrored outside `yahoo.com`, on the Lojban web server:\n`http://www.lojban.org/lsg2/`)\n\nIf you have received a registration form and an order form with this booklet,\nyou can provide us with useful information to aid us in serving you, and can\norder some of our materials.

The lujvo-making algorithm\n\nThe following is the current algorithm for generating Lojban lujvo given a\nknown tanru and a complete list of gismu and their assigned rafsi. The\nalgorithm was designed by Bob LeChevalier and Dr. James Cooke Brown for\ncomputer program implementation. It was modified in 1989 with the assistance\nof Nora LeChevalier, who detected a flaw in the original “tosmabru test”.\n\nGiven a tanru that is to be made into a lujvo:\n\n1)\n\n    Choose a 3-letter or 4-letter rafsi for each of the gismu and cmavo in the tanru except the last.\n2)\n\n    Choose a 3-letter (CVV-form or CCV-form) or 5-letter rafsi for the final gismu in the tanru.\n3)\n\n    Join the resulting string of rafsi, initially without hyphens.\n4)\n\n    Add hyphen letters where necessary. It is illegal to add a hyphen at a place that is not required by this algorithm. Right-to-left tests are recommended, for reasons discussed below. \n\n4a)\n\n    If there are more than two words in the tanru, put an “r”-hyphen (or an “n”-hyphen) after the first rafsi if it is CVV-form. If there are exactly two words, then put an “r”-hyphen (or an “n”-hyphen) between the two rafsi if the first rafsi is CVV-form, unless the second rafsi is CCV-form (for example, “saicli” requires no hyphen). Use an “r”-hyphen unless the letter after the hyphen is “r”, in which case use an “n”-hyphen. Never use an “n”-hyphen unless it is required.\n4b)\n\n    Put a “y”-hyphen between the consonants of any impermissible consonant pair.

These words\nare in effect names for concepts, and the names were invented by speakers of\nanother language. The vast majority of words referring to plants, animals,\nfoods, and scientific terminology cannot be easily expressed as tanru. They\nthus must be borrowed (actually “copied”) into Lojban from the original\nlanguage.\n\nThere are four stages of borrowing in Lojban, as words become more and more\nmodified (but shorter and easier to use). Stage 1 is the use of a foreign name\nquoted with the cmavo “la'o” (explained in full in Chapter 19):\n\n    \n    \n    7.1)   me la'o ly. spaghetti .ly.\n    \n\nis a predicate with the place structure “x1 is a quantity of spaghetti”.\n\nStage 2 involves changing the foreign name to a Lojbanized name, as explained\nin Section 8:\n\n    \n    \n    7.2)   me la spagetis.\n    \n\nOne of these expedients is often quite sufficient when you need a word quickly\nin conversation. (This can make it easier to get by when you do not yet have\nfull command of the Lojban vocabulary, provided you are talking to someone who\nwill recognize the borrowing.)\n\nWhere a little more universality is desired, the word to be borrowed must be\nLojbanized into one of several permitted forms. A rafsi is then usually\nattached to the beginning of the Lojbanized form, using a hyphen to ensure\nthat the resulting word doesn’t fall apart.\n\nThe rafsi categorizes or limits the meaning of the fu'ivla; otherwise a word\nhaving several different jargon meanings in other languages would require the\nword-inventor to choose which meaning should be assigned to the fu'ivla, since\nfu'ivla (like other brivla) are not permitted to have more than one\ndefinition. Such a Stage 3 borrowing is the most common kind of fu'ivla.\n\nFinally, Stage 4 fu'ivla do not have any rafsi classifier, and are used where\na fu'ivla has become so common or so important that it must be made as short\nas possible. (See Section 16 for a proposal concerning Stage 4 fu'ivla.)\n\nThe form of a fu'ivla reliably distinguishes it from both the gismu and the\ncmavo. Like cultural gismu, fu'ivla are generally based on a word from a\nsingle non-Lojban language. The word is “borrowed” (actually “copied”, hence\nthe Lojban tanru “fukpi valsi”) from the other language and Lojbanized — the\nphonemes are converted to their closest Lojban equivalent and modifications\nare made as necessary to make the word a legitimate Lojban fu'ivla-form word.\nAll fu'ivla:\n\n  1. must contain a consonant cluster in the first five letters of the word; if this consonant cluster is at the beginning, it must either be a permissible initial consonant pair, or a longer cluster such that each pair of adjacent consonants in the cluster is a permissible initial consonant pair: “spraile” is acceptable, but not “ktraile” or “trkaile”;\n  2. must end in one or more vowels;\n  3. must not be gismu or lujvo, or any combination of cmavo, gismu, and lujvo; furthermore, a fu'ivla with a CV cmavo joined to the front of it must not have the form of a lujvo (the so-called “slinku'i test”, not discussed further in this book);\n  4. cannot contain “y”, although they may contain syllabic pronunciations of Lojban consonants;\n  5. like other brivla, are stressed on the penultimate syllable.\n\nNote that consonant triples or larger clusters that are not at the beginning\nof a fu'ivla can be quite flexible, as long as all consonant pairs are\npermissible. There is no need to restrict fu'ivla clusters to permissible\ninitial pairs except at the beginning.\n\nThis is a fairly liberal definition and allows quite a lot of possibilities\nwithin “fu'ivla space”. Stage 3 fu'ivla can be made easily on the fly, as\nlujvo can, because the procedure for forming them always guarantees a word\nthat cannot violate any of the rules. Stage 4 fu'ivla require running tests\nthat are not simple to characterize or perform, and should be made only after\ndeliberation and by someone knowledgeable about all the considerations that\napply.\n\nHere is a simple and reliable procedure for making a non-Lojban word into a\nvalid Stage 3 fu'ivla:\n\n  1. Eliminate all double consonants and silent letters.\n  2. Convert all sounds to their closest Lojban equivalents. Lojban “y”, however, may not be used in any fu'ivla.\n  3. If the last letter is not a vowel, modify the ending so that the word ends in a vowel, either by removing a final consonant or by adding a suggestively chosen final vowel.\n  4. If the first letter is not a consonant, modify the beginning so that the word begins with a consonant, either by removing an initial vowel or adding a suggestively chosen initial consonant.\n  5. Prefix the result of steps 1-5 with a 4-letter rafsi that categorizes the fu'ivla into a “topic area”. It is only safe to use a 4-letter rafsi; short rafsi sometimes produce invalid fu'ivla. Hyphenate the rafsi to the rest of the fu'ivla with an “r”-hyphen; if that would produce a double “r”, use an “n”-hyphen instead; if the rafsi ends in “r” and the rest of the fu'ivla begins with “n” (or vice versa), or if the rafsi ends in \"r\" and the rest of the fu'ivla begins with \"tc\", \"ts\", \"dj\", or \"dz\" (using \"n\" would result in a phonotactically impermissible cluster), use an “l”-hyphen. (This is the only use of “l”-hyphen in Lojban.)\n\nAlternatively, if a CVC-form short rafsi is available it can be used instead\nof the long rafsi.\n\n  6. Remember that the stress necessarily appears on the penultimate (next-to-the-last) syllable.\n\nIn this section, the hyphen is set off with commas in the examples, but these\ncommas are not required in writing, and the hyphen need not be pronounced as a\nseparate syllable.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n    \n    \n    7.3)   spaghetti (from English or Italian)\n           spageti (Lojbanize)\n           cidj,r,spageti (prefix long rafsi)\n           dja,r,spageti (prefix short rafsi)\n    \n\nwhere “cidj-” is the 4-letter rafsi for “cidja”, the Lojban gismu for “food”,\nthus categorizing “cidjrspageti” as a kind of food. The form with the short\nrafsi happens to work, but such good fortune cannot be relied on: in any\nevent, it means the same thing.\n\n    \n    \n    7.4)   Acer (the scientific name of maple trees)\n           acer (Lojbanize)\n           xaceru (add initial consonant and final vowel)\n           tric,r,xaceru (prefix rafsi)\n           ric,r,xaceru (prefix short rafsi)\n    \n\nwhere “tric-” and “ric-” are rafsi for “tricu”, the gismu for “tree”. Note\nthat by the same principles, “maple sugar” could get the fu'ivla\n“saktrxaceru”, or could be represented by the tanru “tricrxaceru sakta”.\nTechnically, “ricrxaceru” and “tricrxaceru” are distinct fu'ivla, but they\nwould surely be given the same meanings if both happened to be in use.\n\n    \n    \n    7.5)   brie (from French)\n           bri (Lojbanize)\n           cirl,r,bri (prefix rafsi)\n    \n\nwhere “cirl-” represents “cirla” (“cheese”).\n\n    \n    \n    7.6)   cobra\n           kobra (Lojbanize)\n           sinc,r,kobra (prefix rafsi)\n    \n\nwhere “sinc-” represents “since” (“snake”).\n\n    \n    \n    7.7)   quark\n           kuark (Lojbanize)\n           kuarka (add final vowel)\n           sask,r,kuarka (prefix rafsi)\n    \n\nwhere “sask-” represents “saske” (“science”). Note the extra vowel “a” added\nto the end of the word, and the diphthong “ua”, which never appears in gismu\nor lujvo, but may appear in fu'ivla.\n\n    \n    \n    \n    7.8)   자모 (from Korean)\n           djamo (Lojbanize)\n           lerf,r,djamo (prefix rafsi)\n           ler,l,djamo (prefix rafsi)\n    \n\nwhere “ler-” represents “lerfu” (“letter”). Note the l-hyphen in \"lerldjamo\",\nsince \"lerndjamo\" contains the forbidden cluster \"ndj\".\n\nThe use of the prefix helps distinguish among the many possible meanings of\nthe borrowed word, depending on the field. As it happens, “spageti” and\n“kuarka” are valid Stage 4 fu'ivla, but “xaceru” looks like a compound cmavo,\nand “kobra” like a gismu.\n\nFor another example, “integral” has a specific meaning to a mathematician. But\nthe Lojban fu'ivla “integrale”, which is a valid Stage 4 fu'ivla, does not\nconvey that mathematical sense to a non-mathematical listener, even one with\nan English-speaking background; its source — the English word “integral” — has\nvarious other specialized meanings in other fields.\n\nLeft uncontrolled, “integrale” almost certainly would eventually come to mean\nthe same collection of loosely related concepts that English associates with\n“integral”, with only the context to indicate (possibly) that the mathematical\nterm is meant.\n\nThe prefix method would render the mathematical concept as “cmacrntegrale”, if\nthe “i” of “integrale” is removed, or something like “cmacrnintegrale”, if a\nnew consonant is added to the beginning; “cmac-” is the rafsi for “cmaci”\n(“mathematics”). The architectural sense of “integral” might be conveyed with\n“djinrnintegrale” or “tarmrnintegrale”, where “dinju” and “tarmi” mean\n“building” and “form” respectively.\n\nHere are some fu'ivla representing cultures and related things, shown with\nmore than one rafsi prefix:\n\n    \n    \n    7.9)   bang,r,blgaria\n           Bulgarian (in language)\n    \n    7.10)   kuln,r,blgaria\n           Bulgarian (in culture)\n    \n    7.11)  gugd,r,blgaria\n           Bulgaria (the country)\n    \n    7.12)  bang,r,kore,a\n           Korean (the language)\n    \n    7.13)  kuln,r,kore,a\n           Korean (the culture)\n    \n\nNote the commas in Examples 7.12 and 7.13, used because “ea” is not a valid\ndiphthong in Lojban. Arguably, some form of the native name “Chosen” should\nhave been used instead of the internationally known “Korea”; this is a\nrecurring problem in all borrowings. In general, it is better to use the\nnative name unless using it will severely impede understanding: “Navajo” is\nfar more widely known than “Dine’e”.\n\n* * *\n\nPrevious\n\nrafsi\n\nNext\n\ncmene\n\nThe Shape Of Words To Come: Lojban Morphology\n\nThe Lojban Reference Grammar\n\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://lojban.github.io/cll/4/7/", "title": "The Shape Of Words To Come: Lojban Morphology - The Lojban Reference Grammar", "language": "No language found."}}
