jbo_108.txt,When a tanru is made into a lujvo … the place-structure of the lujvo is always that of the right-most selbri. The left-hand selbri only modifies the meaning.,"* **_brivla_** are called _bridi-words_ because they by default are selbri, and therefore almost all Lojban words with a place structure are brivla. This has also given them the English nickname _content-words_. It's nearly impossible to say anything useful without brivla, and almost all words for concepts outside lojban grammar (and even most of the words for things in the language) are captured by brivla. As shown in the table, brivla has three subcategories:   * **_gismu_** are the root words of the language. Only about 1450 exist, and very few new ones are added. They cover the most basic concepts like _circle_ , _friend_ , _tree_ and _dream_. Examples include **zdani** , **pelxu** and **dunda**   * **_lujvo_** are made by combining rafsi (see under rafsi), respresenting gismu. By combining rafsi, one narrows down the meaning of the word. lujvo are made by an elaborate algorithm, so making valid lujvo on the fly is near impossible, with few exceptions like **selpa'i** , from **se prami** , which can only have one definition. Instead, lujvo are made once, its place structure defined, and then that definition is made official by the dictionary. Examples include brivla (bridi-word), **cinjikca** (sexual-socializing = flirting) and **cakcinki** (shell-insect = beetle).   * **_zi'evla_** are made by making up words which fit the definition for brivla, but not for lujvo or gismu. They tend to cover concepts which it's hard to cover by lujvo, for instance names of species, nations or very cultural specific concepts. Examples include **xanguke** (South Korea) **cidjrpitsa** (pizza) or **.angeli** (angel).   * **_cmavo_** are small words with one or zero consonants. They tend to not signify anything in the exterior world, but to have only grammatical function. Exceptions occur, and it's debatable how much attitudinals exists for their grammatical function. Another weird example are the words of the class GOhA, which act as brivla. It is valid to type several cmavo in a row as one word, but in these lessons, that won't be done. By grouping certain cmavo in functional units, though, it is sometimes easier to read. Thus, **uipuzuvukumi citka** is valid, and is parsed and understood as **ui pu zu vu ku mi citka**. Like other Lojban words, one should (but need not always) place a full stop before any words beginning with a vowel.",79,2593–2597

The place structure of a tanru is always that of the right-most selbri.

A tanru is itself a selbri, and can combine with other selbri or tanru to form more complex tanru. Thus **zdani vecnu** is a tanru, as well as **pelxu zdani vecnu** , which is made from the tanru **pelxu zdani** and the single brivla word **vecnu**. To understand the concept of tanru, consider the English noun combination _lemon tree_.

Perhaps a lemon-colored tree, or a tree shaped like a lemon, or a tree whose bark tastes like lemon. The only things you could know for sure would be that it would be a tree, and it would be lemon- like in some way.  A tanru is closely analogous to this. It cannot be said exactly what a **zdani vecnu** is, but it can be said that it is definitely a **vecnu** , and that it's **zdani** -like in some way. And it could be **zdani** -like in any way. In theory, no matter how silly or absurd the connection to **zdani** was, it could still truly be a **zdani vecnu**. However, it must actually be a **vecnu** in the ordinary sense in order for the tanru to apply.

The place structure of a tanru is always that of the rightmost selbri.

A tanru is itself a selbri, and can combine with other selbri or tanru to form more complex tanru. Thus **zdani vecnu** is a tanru, as well as **pelxu zdani vecnu** , which is made from the tanru **pelxu zdani** and the single brivla word **vecnu**. To understand the concept of tanru, consider the English noun combination _lemon tree_.

Perhaps a lemon-colored tree, or a tree shaped like a lemon, or a tree whose bark tastes like lemon.

It cannot be said exactly what a **zdani vecnu** is, but it can be said that it is definitely a **vecnu** , and that it's **zdani** -like in some way. And it could be **zdani** -like in any way. In theory, no matter how silly or absurd the connection to **zdani** was, it could still truly be a **zdani vecnu**. However, it must actually be a **vecnu** in the ordinary sense in order for the tanru to apply.

The concept is very close to what we call a proposition in English. A bridi is a claim that some objects stand in a relation to each other, or that an object has some property. This stands in contrast to **jufra** , which are merely Lojban utterances, which can be bridi or anything else being said. The difference between a bridi and a jufra is that a jufra does not necessarily state anything, while a bridi does. Thus, a bridi might be true or false, while not all jufra can be said to be such.  To have some examples (in English, to begin with), _Mozart was the greatest musician of all time_ is a bridi, because it makes a claim with a truth value, and it involves an object, Mozart, and a property, being the greatest musician of all time. On the contrary, _Ow! My toe!_ is not a bridi, since it does not involve a relation, and thus does not state anything. Both, though, are jufra.  Try to identify the bridi among these English jufra:    1. _I hate it when you do that._   2. _Woah, that looks delicious!_   3. _Geez, not again._   4. _No, I own three cars_   5. _Nineteen minutes past eight._   6. _This Saturday, yes._  Answer: 1, 2 and 4 are bridi. The rest contain no relation or claim of a property.  Put in Lojban terms, a bridi consists of one **selbri** , and one or more **sumti**.

A tanru is itself a selbri, and can combine with other selbri or tanru to form more complex tanru. Thus **zdani vecnu** is a tanru, as well as **pelxu zdani vecnu** , which is made from the tanru **pelxu zdani** and the single brivla word **vecnu**. To understand the concept of tanru, consider the English noun combination _lemon tree_.

Perhaps a lemon-colored tree, or a tree shaped like a lemon, or a tree whose bark tastes like lemon. The only things you could know for sure would be that it would be a tree, and it would be lemon- like in some way.  A tanru is closely analogous to this. It cannot be said exactly what a **zdani vecnu** is, but it can be said that it is definitely a **vecnu** , and that it's **zdani** -like in some way. And it could be **zdani** -like in any way. In theory, no matter how silly or absurd the connection to **zdani** was, it could still truly be a **zdani vecnu**. However, it must actually be a **vecnu** in the ordinary sense in order for the tanru to apply. You could gloss **zdani vecnu** as _home seller_ , or even better but worse sounding _a home-type-of seller_. The place structure of a tanru is always that of the rightmost selbri.

jbo_78.txt,"# Compound verbs (lujvo) ... “Grammatically, lujvo behave just like gismu: they have place structures and function as selbri.”","Lujvo  | Compound word. Derived from from _lujvla_ , meaning _complex word_ | Min. 6 letters. Made by stringing rafsi together with binding letters if necessary.  | Covers more complex concepts than gismu.    zi'evla  | Free-word  | As brivla, but do not meet defining criteria of gismu or lujvo, ex: **angeli** | Covers unique concepts like names of places or organisms.    cmevla  | Name-word  | Beginning and ending with pause (full stop). Last sound/letter is a consonant.  | Always acts as a name or as the content of a quote.    cmavo  | Grammar-word. From _cmavla_ , meaning _small word_ | One consonant or zero, always at the beginning. Ends in a vowel.  | Grammatical functions. Varies    Word-fragments:  |  |  |    rafsi  | Affix  | CCV, CVC, CV'V, -CVCCV, -CCVCV, CVCCy- or CCVCy-  | Not actual words, but can be stringed together to form lujvo       * **_cmevla_** are very easy to identify because they begin and end with a pause, signaled by a full stop in writing, and the last letter is a consonant. Cmevla have two functions: They can either act as a proper name, if prefixed by the article **la** (explained in next lesson), or they can act as the content of a quote. As previously stated, one can mark stress in the names by capitalizing the letters which are stressed. Examples of cmevla are: **.io'AN.** (Johan), **.mat.** (Matt) and **.cumindzyn.** (Xuming Zeng). Names which do not end in consonants have to have one added: **.anas.** (Anna), or removed: **.an.**   * **_brivla_** are called _bridi-words_ because they by default are selbri, and therefore almost all Lojban words with a place structure are brivla. This has also given them the English nickname _content-words_. It's nearly impossible to say anything useful without brivla, and almost all words for concepts outside lojban grammar (and even most of the words for things in the language) are captured by brivla. As shown in the table, brivla has three subcategories:   * **_gismu_** are the root words of the language. Only about 1450 exist, and very few new ones are added. They cover the most basic concepts like _circle_ , _friend_ , _tree_ and _dream_. Examples include **zdani** , **pelxu** and **dunda**   * **_lujvo_** are made by combining rafsi (see under rafsi), respresenting gismu. By combining rafsi, one narrows down the meaning of the word. lujvo are made by an elaborate algorithm, so making valid lujvo on the fly is near impossible, with few exceptions like **selpa'i** , from **se prami** , which can only have one definition. Instead, lujvo are made once, its place structure defined, and then that definition is made official by the dictionary. Examples include brivla (bridi-word), **cinjikca** (sexual-socializing = flirting) and **cakcinki** (shell-insect = beetle).   * **_zi'evla_** are made by making up words which fit the definition for brivla, but not for lujvo or gismu. They tend to cover concepts which it's hard to cover by lujvo, for instance names of species, nations or very cultural specific concepts. Examples include **xanguke** (South Korea) **cidjrpitsa** (pizza) or **.angeli** (angel).   * **_cmavo_** are small words with one or zero consonants. They tend to not signify anything in the exterior world, but to have only grammatical function. Exceptions occur, and it's debatable how much attitudinals exists for their grammatical function. Another weird example are the words of the class GOhA, which act as brivla. It is valid to type several cmavo in a row as one word, but in these lessons, that won't be done. By grouping certain cmavo in functional units, though, it is sometimes easier to read. Thus, **uipuzuvukumi citka** is valid, and is parsed and understood as **ui pu zu vu ku mi citka**. Like other Lojban words, one should (but need not always) place a full stop before any words beginning with a vowel.",75,2585–2597

jbo_96.txt,"A tanru is formed when a selbri is put in front of another selbri, modifying its meaning. …  If you leave two selbri together they are understood as one tanru.  (There can be only one selbri per bridi.)","* **_brivla_** are called _bridi-words_ because they by default are selbri, and therefore almost all Lojban words with a place structure are brivla. This has also given them the English nickname _content-words_. It's nearly impossible to say anything useful without brivla, and almost all words for concepts outside lojban grammar (and even most of the words for things in the language) are captured by brivla. As shown in the table, brivla has three subcategories:   * **_gismu_** are the root words of the language. Only about 1450 exist, and very few new ones are added. They cover the most basic concepts like _circle_ , _friend_ , _tree_ and _dream_. Examples include **zdani** , **pelxu** and **dunda**   * **_lujvo_** are made by combining rafsi (see under rafsi), respresenting gismu. By combining rafsi, one narrows down the meaning of the word. lujvo are made by an elaborate algorithm, so making valid lujvo on the fly is near impossible, with few exceptions like **selpa'i** , from **se prami** , which can only have one definition. Instead, lujvo are made once, its place structure defined, and then that definition is made official by the dictionary. Examples include brivla (bridi-word), **cinjikca** (sexual-socializing = flirting) and **cakcinki** (shell-insect = beetle).   * **_zi'evla_** are made by making up words which fit the definition for brivla, but not for lujvo or gismu. They tend to cover concepts which it's hard to cover by lujvo, for instance names of species, nations or very cultural specific concepts. Examples include **xanguke** (South Korea) **cidjrpitsa** (pizza) or **.angeli** (angel).   * **_cmavo_** are small words with one or zero consonants. They tend to not signify anything in the exterior world, but to have only grammatical function. Exceptions occur, and it's debatable how much attitudinals exists for their grammatical function. Another weird example are the words of the class GOhA, which act as brivla. It is valid to type several cmavo in a row as one word, but in these lessons, that won't be done. By grouping certain cmavo in functional units, though, it is sometimes easier to read. Thus, **uipuzuvukumi citka** is valid, and is parsed and understood as **ui pu zu vu ku mi citka**. Like other Lojban words, one should (but need not always) place a full stop before any words beginning with a vowel.      * cmavo of the form xVV, CV'VV or V'VV are experimental, and are words which are not in the official language definition, but which have been added by Lojban users to respond to a certain need.   * **_rafsi_** are not Lojban words, and can never appear alone. However, several (more than one) rafsi combine to form lujvo. These must still live up to the brivla-definition, for instance **lojban** is invalid because it ends in a consonant (which makes it a cmevla), and **ci'ekei** is invalid because it does not contain a consonant cluster, and is thus read as two cmavo written as one word. Often, a 3-4 letter string is both a cmavo and a rafsi, like **zu'e** , which is both the BAI and the rafsi for **zukte**. Note that there is nowhere that both a cmavo and a rafsi would be grammatical, so these are not considered homophones. All gismu can double as (word-final) rafsi, if they are prefixed with another rafsi. The first four letter of a gismu suffixed with an ""y"" can also act as a rafsi, if they are suffixed with another rafsi. The vowel ""y"" can only appear in lujvo or cmevla. Valid rafsi letter combinations are: CVV, CV'V, CCV, CVCCy- CCVCy-, -CVCCV and -CCVCV.",76,2593–2599

Two things to be careful of, though, are pronouncing Lojban **i** and **u** like Standard British English ""hit"" and ""but"" (Northern English ""but"" is fine!). This is because non-Lojban vowels, particularly these two, are used to separate consonants by people who find them hard to say. For example, if you have problems spitting out the **zd** in **zdani** (house), you can say **zɪdani** — where the **ɪ** is very short, but the final **i** has to be long.  ### Writing Lojban  As you have already seen, Lojban uses the Latin alphabet, though various Lojbanists have suggested different, usually self-designed ones. Furthermore, Lojban almost always uses lower-case letters. Capital letters are only used to mark stress in proper names, but people tend to avoid them even in names.  Apart from the letters, some punctuation is used:  A full stop (period) is a glottal stop (the consonant in the middle of ""uh- oh"") or a short pause. The rules of Lojban make it easier for one word to run into another when the second word begins with a vowel; so any word starting with a vowel conventionally has a full stop placed in front of it. Full stops are not usually used to end sentences.  Commas are rare in Lojban. They are only used to emphasize boundaries between",100,1084–1111
